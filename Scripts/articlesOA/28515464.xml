We performed an integrative analysis of whole blood gene expression and plasma analytes, comparing South Indian TB patients with and without DM to diabetic and non-diabetic controls without TB. Luminex assay of plasma cytokines and growth factors delineated a distinct biosignature in comorbid TBDM in this cohort. Transcriptional profiling revealed elements in common with published TB signatures from cohorts that excluded DM. Neutrophil count correlated with the molecular degree of perturbation, especially in TBDM patients. Body mass index and HDL cholesterol were negatively correlated with molecular degree of perturbation. Diabetic complication pathways including several pathways linked to epigenetic reprogramming were activated in TBDM above levels observed with DM alone. Our data provide a rationale for trials of host-directed therapies in TBDM, targeting neutrophilic inflammation and diabetic complication pathways to address the greater morbidity and mortality associated with this increasingly prevalent dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adverse effect of type 2 DM on TB severity at presentation, treatment response, outcomes and relapse has become a major global public health concern due to rapidly increasing DM prevalence in countries where TB prevalence was already high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The mechanisms responsible for TB susceptibility and severity in DM are not well understood and there is a paucity of data to inform the management of TBDM patients and the design of interventional and implementation trials to address this problem. Susceptibility of diabetic mice results from a delayed innate immune response to the alveolar macrophages initially infected with inhaled <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, resulting in several additional days of logarithmic bacterial replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Once expressed in the lung, T cell mediated immunity is qualitatively intact but with a quantitatively greater burden of inflammatory pathology due to the higher plateau bacterial burden along with possible defects in counterregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>Investigating early events in human TB is challenging since patients typically present more than 2 months after disease onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, comorbid DM specifically increases the risk for pulmonary more than extrapulmonary TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> which presents another barrier to clinical investigation since sampling the site of disease is impossible in most settings. The blood transcriptome offers a reflection of immunological events in the lung and a consensus gene expression signature of active TB is emerging from observational studies in nondiabetic TB patients in Africa, China, Europe and Indonesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. To gain insights into mechanisms of TB susceptibility in human DM and to assess the impact of TB disease on diabetic complications, we leveraged data and blood samples from diabetic and nondiabetic TB patients enrolled in the Effects of Diabetes on Tuberculosis Severity (EDOTS) study in Chennai, India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Integrative analysis applied to these data showed a high degree of comparability in the blood transcriptional response to TB between diabetic and nondiabetic participants but a distinct signature of plasma cytokine and growth factor levels and an association of TBDM with neutrophilic inflammation. The data further show that comorbid TB activates a range of pathways associated with diabetic complications, above the levels observed with DM alone. We conclude that neutrophilic inflammation and diabetic complication pathways may be useful targets for host-directed therapies to improve TB treatment and outcomes in this growing patient population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>EDOTS is a longitudinal, observational cohort study comparing adult participants with pulmonary TB in Chennai, India, who are rigorously classified as diabetic or normoglycemic according to WHO guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The investigations reported here used demographic and clinical data as well as stored samples of plasma and whole blood RNA collected at enrollment from 60 EDOTS cohort participants (30 diabetic and 30 normoglycemic). Since the phenotype of TBDM might differ between participants who were diabetic prior to incident TB and those with an initial diagnosis of DM at the time of enrollment in EDOTs, we restricted the current investigation to participants with preexisting DM. Retreatment of TB, prior active TB diagnosis and HIV infection are exclusion criteria for EDOTS. TB diagnosis was classified by positive sputum culture for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. Comparison was made with 60 control participants without active TB disease, of whom 30 were classified as diabetic and 30 as normoglycemic using identical case definitions. Demographic and behavioral differences were identified between participants with TBDM dual burden, TB alone, DM alone and healthy controls (Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Those with TBDM tended to be older than normoglycemic participants with TB but less likely to report tobacco or alcohol consumption. The healthy control and DM subgroups had comparable, normal median body mass index (BMI) whereas median BMI was significantly lower in the TBDM and TB subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Demographic, behavioral and clinical laboratory parameters</title><p>Among the 120 participants in the current investigation, median glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) was 5.5%, 7.5%, 5.7% and 10.2% in the subgroups of healthy controls, DM, TB, and TBDM, respectively (Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). All subgroups were vitamin D insufficient (&#x0003c;20&#x02009;ng/mL; Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Median circulating leukocytes and absolute neutrophil count were higher in TBDM patients than the other subgroups, but both DM subgroups had higher neutrophil counts than healthy controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Participants with TBDM had lower serum triglycerides and lower HDL than the DM subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The monocyte:HDL ratio (MHR), a biomarker associated with coronary artery disease risk and severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> was also higher in the TBDM and TB subgroups compared to DM and to healthy controls.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Factors associated with TB and/or DM in the cohort.

</p><p>We applied Bayesian Network modeling to infer causal relations between the presence of TB and/or DM and the recorded demographic, behavioral and clinical laboratory parameters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The network learned from these variables represents the minimum probabilistic dependency between the variables that explains most of the observed correlations in the data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This confirmed the expected associations of DM with patient age, HbA1c, triglycerides and VLDL, total and LDL cholesterol. Gender (male), alcohol use and smoking formed an association chain with TB, while BMI and lymphocyte count were also strongly associated with TB. Neutrophil count was identified at the nexus between DM and TB. Altogether, these data indicate that neutrophilic inflammation is a central feature of TBDM and that incident TB disease elevates levels of biomarkers associated with diabetic vascular complications above the levels found in DM without comorbid TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Signature pattern of elevated plasma cytokines and growth factors in TBDM comorbidity</title><p>Elevated plasma levels of a broad range of cytokines in TBDM patients have been reported in diverse populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To assess this relationship in our cohort of TB patients and controls, we measured plasma levels of 27 cytokines and growth factors by Luminex immunoassay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Primary analyses revealed that several analytes exhibited statistically different concentrations in plasma between the study groups (Supplemental File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Data was then z-score normalized across the entire cohort and analyzed by hierarchical clustering. Three main clusters were identified and showed 100% separation for TBDM vs. healthy controls, with more overlap between the TB and the DM subgroups. The cluster containing all TBDM cases (and 32% of TB cases) was notable for higher expression of nearly all analytes tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Supplemental File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Surprisingly, another cluster contained both the majority of nondiabetic TB cases (68%) and the majority of diabetic controls without TB (93%). Growth factors elevated in TBDM included VEGF, PDGF and FGF that are all implicated in diabetic complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Supplemental File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Compared to healthy subjects, the levels of several analytes (IFNg, IL-17A, IL-5, CCL4, IL-2, CXCL10, and G-CSF) were significantly higher only in the TBDM subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). We conclude that a signature pattern of plasma levels of cytokines and growth factors distinguished TBDM from DM and healthy control patients, and from a majority of nondiabetic TB patients in this cohort.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cytokine profiling in plasma of patients with TB and/or DM.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Blood transcriptome profile of patients with TB and/or diabetes</title><p>To investigate the impact of DM on human immunity to TB we performed whole blood gene expression profiling of all participants in the cohort. A total of 993 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, comparing the TBDM, TB and DM subgroups to the healthy subjects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, Supplemental File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The expression patterns of these DEGs across all samples revealed considerable heterogeneity among individuals within each subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Most of the DEGs (935) were identified comparing TB or TBDM classes vs. healthy controls. Among these, 455 genes were commonly found in TB and TBDM comparisons. These included genes found in previously reported TB signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Only 74 DEGs were found between DM patients and healthy subjects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). We conclude that the immune response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection is the major driver of the blood transcriptomic changes seen in TBDM patients and this response is only mildly perturbed by DM as compared to the response in nondiabetic individuals with pulmonary TB disease.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Transcriptomic changes with TB and/or diabetes compared to healthy subjects.

</p><p>We next compared differences in the transcriptome profiles between participants with TBDM and participants with either TB or DM alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, Supplemental File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Whereas little change was found between the TBDM and TB subgroups (62 DEGs), a total of 1,138 genes were differentially expressed in TBDM compared to DM patients (&#x0201c;TBDM total&#x0201d;). Of those, 521 genes were also differentially expressed in in the comparison between TB patients and DM patients (&#x0201c;TB shared&#x0201d;). The remaining 436 genes were uniquely differentially expressed in the TBDM vs. DM comparison, reflecting an impact of TBDM comorbidity on blood gene expression distinct from the influence of either TB or DM alone (&#x0201c;TBDM unique&#x0201d;). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis applied to these gene lists revealed the main possible transcriptional upstream regulators driving the TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) and TBDM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>) responses. As expected, TB disease was associated with the induction of genes related to types I and II IFN responses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Among potential regulators significantly enriched in &#x0201c;TBDM unique&#x0201d; genes, several were related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including HNF4A, ATF4, EIF2AK3, and PLA2G6. Glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity are known to promote ER stress in type 2 DM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> but our results indicate that comorbid TB further exacerbates ER stress in diabetic hosts. This may be clinically significant since ER stress is linked to loss of &#x003b2;-cell mass in type 2 DM and is implicated in diabetic complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The &#x0201c;TBDM unique&#x0201d; genes were also significantly enriched by targets of the anti-cancer drugs 5-fluorouracil and semaxanib, and the antibiotic doxycycline (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

When applied to the blood transcriptome, MDH largely reflects immunological activation and it was reported to be higher in TB patients with more severe TB disease on chest x-ray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. To assess global effects of TB and DM on the blood transcriptome we quantified the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) in the transcriptome of each patient. The MDP is adapted from the MDH and conveys similar information but has the advantages of controlling for variability in the control group and allowing for cross-dataset comparisons (see Materials and Methods). Median MDP vs. the healthy control transcriptome was elevated to a comparable degree in the TB and TBDM subgroups compared to participants with DM alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Correlation of the expression values of each individual gene with MDP demonstrated a preponderance of downregulated transcripts in the DM subgroup vs. predominantly upregulated transcripts in TB patients with TBDM spanning these two extremes (Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Across the total cohort, BMI, % and total lymphocytes, total cholesterol and all cholesterol subfractions were negatively correlated with MDP, while positive correlations were identified with HbA1c, total WBC, % and total neutrophils and % monocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Within the participant subgroups, a negative correlation of HDL cholesterol and MDP was identified only in TBDM patients, while neutrophils were positively correlated with MDP in the TB, DM and TBDM subgroups. Of note, the frequency of participants with high MDP and high absolute neutrophil count was greatest in the TBDM subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). These observations suggest an association of peripheral blood neutrophil numbers in with TB disease severity as reflected by MDP in patients with TB or TBDM. The data also suggest an association of low HDL cholesterol with the hyperinflammatory response of TBDM patients while high BMI was associated with a lower level of systemic inflammation in all subgroups.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Factors associated with increased molecular degree of perturbation.

Statistically significant correlation of MDP with the presence of bilateral vs. unilateral lung involvement was identified in TB patients, with a similar trend in TBDM. The presence of cavitary lesions correlated significantly with MDP in TBDM, with a similar trend in the TB subgroup. We conclude that immune activation as reflected by whole blood MDP is comparably elevated across the groups of TB and TBDM patients and correlates at the individual level with immune pathology and disease severity estimated by chest x-ray. These data further support the association of neutrophilic inflammation with TB severity, a relationship that is particularly strong in the TBDM subgroup.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Classification of active TB by whole blood gene expression</title><p>Blood transcriptional signatures may inform the development of rapid diagnostic tests to distinguish between TB infection and TB disease. To determine whether comorbid DM alters the expression of TB signature genes, we analyzed the expression of a previously described 393-gene TB signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> using the microarray dataset from our cohort, ordering the results by hierarchical clustering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). By this approach, 72% of nondiabetic participants with TB and 68% of participants with TBDM were correctly classified by the active TB disease signature. The second main cluster accurately classified 100% of healthy controls but misclassified 28% in the TB subgroup and 32% in the TBDM subgroup. The clustering results were compared at the individual level with MDP, which revealed that most patients with active TB who were misclassified in the healthy control cluster had lower MDP than the TB and TBDM subgroup members who were accurately classified as having active TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). Despite this moderate level of correct classification using the 393-gene signature, we noted that DEGs common to TB patients with or without DM in our cohort included all four genes from a 4-gene signature proposed by Maertzdorf <italic>et al</italic>. as the basis for developing a point-of-care diagnostic test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).

There is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms and consequences of the interactions between DM and TB in order to define research priorities and provide a rational basis for the development of interventions. To address this gap in knowledge we collected clinical data, measured plasma cytokines and growth factors, and analyzed whole blood gene expression in a prospectively recruited cohort of South Indian adult pulmonary TB patients who were rigorously classified as diabetic or normoglycemic.</p><p>The immunological basis of diabetic TB susceptibility is not completely understood but insights have been gained from animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

Once underway, the T cell response in diabetic mice appears to be functionally intact but quantitatively excessive, possibly reflecting higher antigen load and/or defective counterregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. On this basis, we predicted that the immune response in TBDM patients would be qualitatively similar but quantitatively greater than that occurring the in the majority of nondiabetic TB patients.</p><p>Bayesian network analysis placed neutrophils at nexus of the connection between DM and TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). An association of neutrophilic inflammation with TB severity in the general population is well recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our data indicate that comorbid DM amplifies this response, which might reflect high bacterial load and/or a specific perturbation of immune function. Elevated of levels of plasma cytokines and growth factors distinguished participants with TBDM from two thirds of nondiabetic TB cases and all but one DM control whereas there was substantial overlap between the nondiabetic TB group and the diabetic controls without TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Results for the TBDM group are consistent with and extend published human and mouse data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> while the overlap between nondiabetic participants with TB and diabetic controls without TB was unexpected. The latter result points to a need for rigorous classification of glycemic status when interpreting proteomic data, at least in South Indian populations where DM appears to be a strong confounding factor.</p><p>The first published blood transcriptomic signature of active TB in cohorts from the United Kingdom and South Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> highlighted a role for type I IFN signaling in neutrophils. Fourteen subsequent transcriptomic studies analyzed gene expression in whole blood or isolated leukocyte fractions in TB patient cohorts from Africa, Europe, Indonesia and China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Notably, none of these studies focused on TBDM comorbidity or included patients in India. Consistent with our prediction, the qualitative transcriptional response in TBDM closely matched that of the nondiabetic TB signature in terms of DEGs vs. healthy or diabetic participants without TB disease. An important conclusion is that comorbid DM does not appear to confound the clinical application of transcriptional profiling to TB diagnosis. Contrary to our expectation, there was no significant trend for higher MDP in TBDM vs. TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>) although the TBDM subgroup had the highest proportion of individuals with combined high neutrophil count and high MDP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). High MDP was positively correlated with radiographic severity, high neutrophil numbers and low BMI (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B&#x02013;D</xref>). The data are consistent with evidence that higher BMI is protective in TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> but this association is lost in diabetic obesity, presumably as a consequence of diabetic immunopathy. An association of low HDL with high MDP was unique the TBDM subgroup. HDL cholesterol modulates innate and adaptive immunity through interactions with lipid rafts on myeloid and lymphoid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The low HDL cholesterol associated with type 2 DM and pre-diabetes might be a glucose-independent factor contributing to TB susceptibility. We conclude that the transcriptional response to TB is qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the presence or absence of DM but confirmatory studies examining larger numbers of patients are warranted as the relatively small sample size and high degree of individual variation in MDP seen in all four subgroups were limiting factors.</p><p>While the blood transcriptional response did not distinguish TBDM from nondiabetic TB patients, 436 DEGs identified in the comparison of TBDM vs. DM were not shared in the comparison of nondiabetic TB to DM patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A finding with potentially high biological and clinical significance was that many of these &#x0201c;TBDM unique&#x0201d; DEGs participate in pathways that promote diabetic complications. Across a wide range of comparisons in this study, the amplification of genes, cytokines, growth factors and other biomarkers associated with diabetic complications was observed. These included but were not limited to the metrics of NLR and MHR, the plasma levels of VEGF, PDGF and FGF, and pathways associated with DNA damage and oxidative and ER stress, complement and platelet activation, RAGE signaling, and genes and pathways involved in epigenetic remodeling. We propose that a syndemic relationship exists between TB and DM that is conceptually similar to the relationship between TB and HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Amplification of diabetic complication pathways during TB disease could be a factor in the increased early mortality of TBDM vs. DM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and might exacerbate cardiovascular disease, kidney dysfunction, neuropathy and retinopathy in TB survivors. Conversely, the activation of pathways linked to beta cell loss could accelerate progression of dysglycemia. These questions are amenable to clinical investigation and TBDM patients might derive particular benefit from host-directed therapies targeting dyslipidemia, oxidative and ER stress, and other diabetic complication pathways such as RAGE signaling for which a robust drug development pipeline is already in place<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p>Weaknesses of the present study include relatively small sample size, the high degree of individual variability in transcriptional response, heterogeneity within and between participant subgroups, and sample and data collection from the single time point of TB diagnosis.

Results from EDOTS study screening indicate that 54% of adult pulmonary TB patients currently presenting to the government clinic system in Chennai are diabetic and another 21% are prediabetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, making this a clinically important association regardless of causation. Additional strengths were the rigorous case definitions for glycemic status based on oral glucose tolerance test and fasting plasma glucose, the diversity of clinical parameters measured and the application of a validated radiographic scoring method.</p><p>In this systems biology investigation of TBDM comorbidity in a South Indian cohort we found no evidence for a discrete defect in the immune response to established infection.

These early event occurs before patients with active TB seek medical attention and can only be inferred in clinical research by subsequent effects disease evolution.

Despite limitations, the data presented here confirm the association of TBDM with increased, neutrophil-rich inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. An unanticipated finding was that incident TB disease upregulated a broad range of genes and pathways involved in the progression of diabetic complications, above the levels seen in diabetic participants without TB.

The learning algorithm used to establish the network structure was based on the heuristic Hill climb method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The dependencies represented qualitatively by a directed acyclic graph where each node corresponds to a variable and a direct arc between nodes represents a direct influence. Robustness of the arcs was scored by a non-parametric bootstrap test (100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;replicates)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Arcs with more than 30% support were depicted. The strongest associations were considered those remaining statistically significant in &#x02265;60% bootstraps. All analyses were pre-specified. Two-sided <italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons were considered statistically significant.

Total RNA was amplified and purified using TargetAmp-Nano Labeling Kit for Illumina Expression BeadChip (EPICENTRE, Madison, USA) to yield biotinylated cRNA. Briefly, 300&#x02009;ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed, and labeled with biotin-NTP. After purification, the cRNA was quantified on a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, USA). 750&#x02009;ng of labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to each Human HT-12 v4.0 Expression Beadchip for 17&#x02009;h at 58&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, USA). Array signal detection was carried out using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) following the bead array manual. Arrays were scanned with an Illumina BeadArray Reader confocal scanner. Hybridization quality and chip performance were monitored by visual inspection of internal quality control checks and the raw scanned data. Raw data were extracted using Illumina GenomeStudio v2011.1 software (Gene Expression Module v1.9.0). Outlier samples were identified and removed using the arrayQualityMetrics R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Remaining samples per groups were: 29 Healthy, 25 TB, 28 DM and 28 TBDM. Probes whose expression value was not significantly above the detection limit (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in at least 50% of all samples were removed. Data were log2 transformed and corrected for batch effects using the ComBat algorithm implemented in the <italic>sva</italic> R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Probes matching the same gene symbol were collapsed by taking the one with highest expression across all samples. Mean and standard deviation for each gene using all samples were calculated and used to remove the 20% of the genes with lowest expression; and the 20% of the genes with lowest variance. The gene expression dataset used for subsequent analysis comprised 7,515 genes and 110 samples. Heat maps and &#x0201c;corrplots&#x0201d; were created using gplots, heatplus and corrplot R packages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Transcriptome analyses: Differentially expressed gene analysis</title><p>We defined 4 classes of samples: healthy, TB, DM and TBDM. Differential expression analyses were performed for each pair of classes using limma R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. We considered DEGs as those genes having a limma adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and an expression fold change &#x0003e;1.4. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to identify canonical pathways and upstream regulators which were significantly enriched in the DEG lists (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Transcriptome analyses: Calculating the molecular degree of perturbation</title><p>The MDP method used for the present study is an adaptation of the MDH described by Pankla <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Healthy controls were defined as the &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; group, and the average expression level and standard deviation of this reference group were calculated for each gene. The MDP score of an individual gene (gMDP) in a given sample &#x0201c;s&#x0201d; was defined by taking the difference in expression level in sample &#x0201c;s&#x0201d; from the average of the gene in reference group divided by the corresponding standard deviation. Essentially, the gMDP score represents the number of standard deviations from reference. A filter was applied by replacing all absolute gMDP scores below 2 standard deviations by zero. Next, for each phenotype class (TB, DM and TBDM), we calculated the average gMDP score in the class, and used them to identify the top 25% genes with highest gMDP difference between the phenotype class and the reference group. Finally, the MDP of an individual sample (sMDP) was defined by taking the average absolute gMDP scores for all top 25% genes. This filter avoids absolute criteria while keeping the genes that best distinguish the control and test groups. To identify which sample was &#x0201c;perturbed&#x0201d;, we used a threshold consisting of the average sMDP scores plus 2 standard deviations of the reference group. Any sample above this threshold was considered &#x0201c;perturbed&#x0201d; (compared to our reference).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Transcriptome analyses: Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</title><p>Gene MDP scores were used to rank the genes for each participant. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> was run on these pre-ranked individual gene lists using the Reactome pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> as gene sets (GSEA, nominal <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; 1,000 permutations). GSEA calculated the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for the Reactome pathways based on the distribution of member genes of each module in the ranked list. We used the NES values to perform correlation analysis between two pathways or between genes and pathways. The network representing these correlations were created using Gephi.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Transcriptome analyses: Whole blood 393-gene TB signature</title><p>The microarray platform used for the current study included 387 genes present in a previously reported 393-gene transcriptional signature of active TB (Berry <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>).

Genes were used as &#x02018;predictors&#x02019; and the cytokines as &#x02018;respond variables&#x02019;. This method decomposes both predictor and response variation while identifying their correlation and the contributors to each variation component. We determined the minimum number of genes (chosen among the most informative 300 genes) of the first predictor component that best maximize the explained-cytokine variation. In this way, we identified 114 genes which were then correlated (Pearson correlation) with the cytokine profiles allowing to identify the way in which the best explanatory genes correlate with cytokines. GeneMania<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> was used to create an interaction network using as input the 114 genes. The information about &#x0201c;physical interactions&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pathway&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;co-localization&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;shared protein domains&#x0201d; was used to create the edges of the network. Gephi program was used to create the network. We then performed Spearman correlation between the expression of the 114 genes with the NES values (described in &#x02018;Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis&#x02019; section) of all Reactome pathways.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the M.V.
