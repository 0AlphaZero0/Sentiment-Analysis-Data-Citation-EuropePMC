The type II IFN (IFN&#x003b3;) acts on a cell surface receptor (IFNGR) to promote gene expression that enhance macrophage inflammatory and anti-microbial activity. Type I IFNs can dampen macrophage responsiveness to IFN&#x003b3; and are associated with increased susceptibility to numerous bacterial infections. The precise mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Type I IFNs silence macrophage <italic>ifngr1</italic> transcription and thus reduce cell surface expression of IFNGR1. To test how these events might impact macrophage activation and host resistance during bacterial infection, we developed transgenic mice that express a functional FLAG-tagged IFNGR1 (fGR1) driven by a macrophage-specific promoter. Macrophages from fGR1 mice expressed physiologic levels of cell surface IFNGR1 at steady state and responded equivalently to WT C57Bl/6 macrophages when treated with IFN&#x003b3; alone. However, fGR1 macrophages retained cell surface IFNGR1 and showed enhanced responsiveness to IFN&#x003b3; in the presence of type I IFNs. When fGR1 mice were infected with the bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> their resistance was significantly increased, despite normal type I and II IFN production. Enhanced resistance was dependent on IFN&#x003b3; and associated with increased macrophage activation and antimicrobial function. These results argue that down regulation of myeloid cell IFNGR1 is an important mechanism by which type I IFNs suppress inflammatory and anti-bacterial functions of macrophages.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Interferon (IFN)&#x003b3; promotes host resistance to invasive bacterial infections, but type I IFNs suppress macrophage activation and increase susceptibility to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> and other pathogenic bacteria. IFN&#x003b3; promotes resistance by potently activating macrophages to become pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial. Type I IFNs have the opposite effect on resistance during many bacterial infections.

Here, we developed an experimental system to investigate the significance of IFNGR1 down regulation as a mechanism contributing to pro-bacterial effects of type I IFNs. A transgenic mouse (fGR1) was generated in which macrophages resist type I IFN-induced down regulation of IFNGR1.

These cytokines are classified into two major groups: type I and type II. Type I IFNs are a family of homologous proteins including various IFN&#x003b1; subtypes and a single IFN&#x003b2; [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are synthesized and secreted in response to ligation of transmembrane or cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRR) by a variety of microbial products [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All type I IFNs signal through a commonly expressed heterodimeric receptor, IFNAR. Ligation of IFNAR activates TYK2 and JAK1 kinases to phosphorylate signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins 1 and 2 [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These activated STATs associate with IRF9 to induce transcription of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) whose products restrict viral replication [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Type I IFNs additionally impact cell survival and can have anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They are used therapeutically in treatment of chronic viral infections, cancers, and the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis.</p><p>IFN&#x003b3; is the only type II IFN. It signals through its own ubiquitously-expressed heterodimeric receptor (IFNGR) comprised of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 subunits. IFN&#x003b3; binds directly to IFNGR1 to aggregate receptor subunits such that one signaling complex contains two IFNGR1 and two IFNGR2 chains [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This aggregation activates JAK1 and JAK2 kinases to phosphorylate STAT1 proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phosphorylated STAT1 proteins homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus to initiate transcription of IFN&#x003b3;-activated genes (GAG) [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several antiviral proteins are both ISGs and GAGs, but IFN&#x003b3; uniquely stimulates macrophages to express certain GAGs that promote inflammatory responses (e.g. TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, CXCL9, CXCL10), contribute to antigen processing and presentation to T cells (e.g. MHC class I and II, CD40, CD80, CD86, the high-affinity Fc receptor CD64), and promote macrophage bactericidal activity (e.g. nitric oxide synthase 2, NOS2, and NADPH oxidase subunits) [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By inducing expression of these and other GAGs, IFN&#x003b3; drives M1-type pro-inflammatory and microbicidal activation in macrophages.</p><p>IFN&#x003b3; is vital for host resistance to bacterial infections, while type I IFNs have the opposite effect of increasing host susceptibility. Thus, mice lacking IFN&#x003b3;, IFNGR1, or critical signaling components such as STAT1 are exquisitely susceptible to infections by <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculous</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and other pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By contrast, mice unresponsive to type I IFNs are 100&#x02013;1000 times more resistant to mucosal and systemic infections by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>, and numerous other pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These data indicate type I IFNs normally increase susceptibility. Precisely how they do so is debated. It is clear type I IFNs reduce production of several myeloid cell-active cytokines and chemokines with presumed protective functions and increase expression of anti-inflammatory factors [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, detrimental effects of type I IFNs appear to impair myeloid cell immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, it is not agreed how type I IFNs mediate this suppression of myeloid cells. Type I IFNs may primarily act through induction of IL-10 [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], or by suppressing inflammasome activation and IL-1 production in myeloid cells responding to infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Alternatively, we previously suggested type I IFNs may suppress macrophage activation due to their ability to silence myeloid cell <italic>ifngr1</italic> transcription and down regulate macrophage IFNGR1 [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>To distinguish between the above models and test the importance of type I IFN driven down regulation of IFNGR1, we developed a transgenic mouse line in which a functional FLAG-tagged IFNGR1 (fGR1) is selectively expressed in macrophages using the well-characterized <italic>c-fms</italic> promoter [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Staining for the FLAG epitope revealed the fGR1 transgenic IFNGR1 was expressed at very low levels selectively on macrophages and inflammatory monocytes. Total cell surface IFNGR1 on macrophages was equivalent for unstimulated control and fGR1 mice. Control and fGR1 macrophages also responded similarly to stimulation with IFN&#x003b3;. When stimulated with type I IFN, fGR1 macrophages showed similar induction of canonical responses as control cells but selectively retained more cell surface IFNGR1. The ability to resist IFNGR1 down regulation enabled cultured fGR1 macrophages to respond better to IFN&#x003b3; following stimulation with type I IFN. In fGR1 mice, macrophages also showed increased evidence of M1-type activation during systemic infection with the type I IFN-stimulating bacterial pathogen <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>. Further, bacterial burdens were significantly reduced in the fGR1 mice. Heightened resistance of fGR1 mice was dependent on host production of IFN&#x003b3; and associated with significantly increased bacterial uptake and containment in lysosomes, as measured by reduced overall bacterial burdens in fGR1 cells and increased co-localization of GFP expressing <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. These data indicate that preventing type I IFN stimulated down regulation of myeloid cell IFNGR1 during bacterial infection increases host resistance by permitting increased macrophage responsiveness to IFN&#x003b3; and thus increased macrophage activation and bactericidal functions.

Hence, we used flow cytometry to evaluate uptake of the particles into acidified compartments in gated inflammatory monocytes. Results indicated that the proportion of fGR1 monocytes staining bright for pHrodo was increased significantly, as was the MFI of pHrodo staining in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006388.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>). We interpret these data to indicate that inflammatory monocytes expressing fGR1 have an enhanced ability to phagocytose bacteria into compartments that are maturing. Thus, the reduced frequency of infected inflammatory monocytes in the fGR1 mice was not due to impaired phagocytosis.</p><p>The pathogenesis of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> involves bacterial escape from phagosomal compartments into the cytosol of infected cells, where the bacterium undergoes rapid replication. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> that are retained in phagosomes are unable to replicate and can be degraded following phagosome fusion with LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> lysosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We thus next asked whether reduced bacterial burdens and heightened IFN&#x003b3; responsiveness seen in fGR1 monocytes during systemic <italic>in vivo</italic> infection might be associated with improved ability of myeloid cells to restrict <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> to phagosomal compartments. Here, we again used beads to negatively enrich myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006388.s008">S7 Fig</xref>) from spleens of WT and fGR1 transgenic mice at 60 hpi with GFP-expressing <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>. We then assessed the abundance of GFP bacteria and the frequency of their co-localization with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 using fluorescence microscopy. Staining of the isolated cells revealed the presence of bacteria (green) in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells (blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006388.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). In cells from WT B6 mice, bacteria were rarely observed to co-localize with LAMP-1 (red). This result is consistent with bacterial persistence in immature phagosomes or escape into the cell cytoplasm. By contrast, in cells from infected fGR1 mice bacteria frequently co-localized with LAMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006388.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, right). Using the cell function of the Imaris software suite we unbiasedly quantified these differences. The results showed that more CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells from the fGR1 mice contained low numbers of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> bacteria and fewer of these cells contained high numbers of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006388.g007">Fig 7H</xref>).

These data suggest that increased M1 activation enables fGR1 myeloid cells to better engulf and contain <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> within mature phagosomes and phagolysosomes. Hence, despite the continued presence of other responses previously associated with &#x0201c;pro-bacterial&#x0201d; effects of type I IFNs our data demonstrate that attenuating the loss of IFNGR1 suffices to increase myeloid cell-intrinsic bacterial killing and host resistance during systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Discussion</title><p>Animal infection studies over the past decade have revealed the ability of type I IFNs to potently increase host susceptibility to diverse bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Gene expression patterns associated with type I IFNs have also been implicated in increased disease severity in humans with naturally-encountered <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> infections [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the &#x0201c;pro-bacterial&#x0201d; effects of these cytokines thus has relevance to human health. Our studies here used a systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection model to provide new experimental evidence in support of the model that type I IFNs exacerbate infection, at least in part, by suppressing macrophage responsiveness to IFN&#x003b3;. Based on our prior finding that type I IFNs silence <italic>de novo</italic> transcription of <italic>ifngr1</italic> to down regulate myeloid cell expression of IFNGR1 [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we developed a transgenic mouse model to express FLAG-tagged IFNGR1 at low levels using the heterologous <italic>c-fms</italic> promoter. Characterization of these mice confirmed the transgenic &#x0201c;fGR1&#x0201d; receptor is selectively expressed in macrophages at a low level that did not increase overall IFNGR1 and did not alter macrophage responsiveness to IFN&#x003b3; stimulation in the absence of type I IFNs. Nevertheless, macrophages expressing fGR1 resisted the loss of IFNGR1 that is normally induced by stimulation with type I IFNs and under these conditions showed increased ability to respond to IFN&#x003b3;. Consistent with these findings, fGR1 mice better resisted systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection. The increased resistance of fGR1 mice was also dependent on IFN&#x003b3;. These data support the model that suppression of macrophage IFN&#x003b3; responsiveness contributes to type I IFN-dependent increase in susceptibility to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> infections [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, our studies here showed that the increased resistance of fGR1 mice correlates with increased expression of IFNGR1 and pro-inflammatory markers by inflammatory monocytes. Further, bacterial loads were reduced in inflammatory monocytes from fGR1 mice and we observed increased association of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells. These results argue that the increased ability of this myeloid cell population to retain IFNGR1 and respond to IFN&#x003b3; led to increased activation of cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Overall, our data suggest that blocking the ability of type I IFNs to suppress macrophage IFNGR1 restores host resistance to systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection by improving antimicrobial &#x0201c;M1&#x0201d; activation of monocytes recruited to sites of infection.</p><p>As mentioned above, diverse other bacterial pathogens also benefit from type I IFN signaling&#x02013;including <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Patients with untreated pulmonary tuberculosis were reported to have decreased IFNGR1 expression on circulating CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes compared to healthy uninfected controls [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, IFNGR1 expression was restored upon antitubercular treatment in many of these patients [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> bacteria might exploit type I IFN-induced suppression of IFNGR1 in myeloid cells. The extent to which this reduction in IFNGR1 is a cause of host susceptibility remains to be explored, however, others have proposed alternative mechanisms that likely also contribute. Specifically, type I IFNs also suppress interleukin-1 and prostaglandin production [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], increase IL-10 production by macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suppress recruitment of inflammatory neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and can promote cellular apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using antibody blockade of IFNAR signaling we confirmed that responsiveness to type I IFNs corresponds with suppressed recruitment or survival of inflammatory monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells in the spleens of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>-infected mice. However, the increased resistance seen in fGR1 mice was not associated with increased numbers of T cells or inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. Thus, blockade of IFNGR1 down regulation appears sufficient to increase host resistance even in the presence of type I IFN-dependent reductions in T cell and inflammatory cell numbers. Previous work in our laboratory has also implicated NK cells as a major source of serum IL-10 detected early after <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and failed to see direct suppression of macrophage cell surface IFNGR1 by IL-10 [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These data suggest fGR1 expression and the preservation of IFNGR1 expression enhances macrophage activation independent of effects on IL-10 production. Nevertheless, additional future studies will be necessary to conclusively define the relative impact of these and other processes on type I IFN-driven increases in susceptibility to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and other pathogens. The fGR1 mice may also be useful more generally to better define how altering regulation of myeloid cell IFNGR1 affects inflammatory and immune responses in other settings, including viral infections, cancer, and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Increased activation of myeloid cells could potentially improve host resistance by cell intrinsic, cell extrinsic, or both mechanisms. Since fGR1 inflammatory monocytes have increased expression of MHC II and CD80 we considered that the increased resistance of fGR1 mice might be associated with an increased activation of T cells. However, fGR1 expression reduced bacterial burdens within 72&#x02013;96 hpi, which is prior to peak T cell activation. Instead, we observed that inflammatory macrophages had reduced bacterial burdens and evidence of increased <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> containment within LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> phagosomes/lysosomes. Early phagosomes are commonly marked by their association with the small GTPase Rab5a which then recruits lysosomal proteins, including LAMP-1, to form a mature phagolysosome [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To escape the phagosome, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> must delay this phagosomal maturation by lysing the vacuole before it associates with impenetrable LAMP-1+ lysosomes. Such escape is a crucial determinant of pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Hence, improved containment of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> to phagosomes suffices to restrict infection. There is furthermore evidence that IFN&#x003b3; stimulation of macrophages improves their ability to mediate such containment [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. How IFN&#x003b3; mediates this effect is not clear. IFN&#x003b3; can modulate phagosome maturation by increasing Rab5a function [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but also upregulates expression of NADPH oxidase subunits [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases). The latter are known to associate with bacteria-containing phagosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and to alter vesicular trafficking and phagosomal maturation [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to distinguish the relative importance of these various mechanisms in mediating the resistance of fGR1 macrophages. Future studies comparing WT and fGR1 macrophages could identify additional mechanisms through which IFN&#x003b3; signaling can increase macrophage resistance to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection.</p><p>Humans are thought to encounter <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection through ingestion of contaminated foods and clinical disease in humans is typically associated with bacteremia or meningitis. However, the impact of type I IFNs on human Listeriosis remains unclear.

In an effort to create a better oral infection model, a <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> strain was engineered to express a mutant InlA that binds more avidly to mouse E-cadherin [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> expressing this &#x0201c;murinized&#x0201d; InlA (InlA<sup>m</sup>) show increased invasiveness for epithelial and certain non-epithelial cell types [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], but they still fail to achieve high-titer systemic infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Using <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> that express InlA<sup>m</sup>, two recent papers presented data suggesting <italic>ifnar1</italic> deficiency fails to substantially increase resistance during the low-burden oral <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Low systemic bacterial burdens were correlated with low systemic concentrations of type I IFNs in these mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Because both IFN production and bacterial burdens were low, it is thus unclear how to interpret the fact that <italic>ifnar1</italic>-deficient mice did not have further reduced burdens in these studies. Low type I IFN production may have either caused or been the result of the low systemic bacterial burdens seen in these studies. Thus, while it remains to be seen how relevant the study of systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection is for understanding of human Listeriosis, it also remains unclear if the mouse oral infection model accurately reflects human disease. Given this and the fact that type I IFNs increase susceptibility to other bacterial infections through mucosal and non-mucosal epithelia colonized by microbes, such as the lung [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], skin [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and urogenital tract [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], we argue that it remains worthwhile to use the systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection model in studies of the mechanisms responsible for the pro-bacterial effects of these cytokines&#x02013;as well as in studies dissecting other aspects of host/pathogen biology.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that host type I IFNs increase susceptibility to systemic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> bacterial infection by promoting loss of IFNGR1 on myeloid cells. While not addressed in our work, it is plausible that this process may also be a contributing factor towards host susceptibility in other bacterial infections. Drugs that target and block this process may thus prove to be useful in the clinical management of severe disseminated Listeriosis and other systemic and mucosal bacterial infections. The development and spread of antibiotic resistance mechanisms is a worldwide problem that limits clinical options for treatment of common infections [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. New therapies for treating bacterial infections are thus urgently needed. Development of host-directed therapeutics that target and inhibit deleterious effects of host type I IFNs appears to be an attractive approach as such host-directed therapies may fail to drive the continued development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and thus have potential for prolonged life in the clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Mice</title><p>fGR1 transgenic mice were created by inserting IFNGR1 cDNA into BsrGI and AgeI restriction digest sites of the 7.2 fms-EGFP transgenic vector kindly provided by Dr. David A Hume [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

The flow-through from the LS magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec) was collected and 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> myeloid cells were plated in a 24-well plate (Gibco) and allowed to adhere for at least 3 hrs. pHrodo <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Bioparticles (ThermoFisher) were reconstituted as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction in Phagocytosis Buffer (HBSS without cations, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The Bioparticles were added to the myeloid cells at a concentration of 30 Bioparticles per cell and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C (experimental) or 4&#x000b0;C (control) for 30 min. Phagocytosis was stopped by the addition of ice-cold Phagocytosis Buffer and the cells were placed on ice.

Single cell suspensions were incubated with PE-tagged antibodies specific for CD90.2, NK1.1, IgM, and Ly6G for depletion using &#x003b1;-PE Microbeads and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). The flow-through was collected and largely comprised monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006388.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). These were stained for surface CD11b (APC), fixed in 4% PFA, and permeabilized with saponin to stain intracellular Lm using Listeria-O rabbit antiserum (Difco) and a F(ab&#x02019;)2 Anti-Rabbit IgG-FITC secondary (eBioscience). Additional stains were LAMP-1/CD107a- PE (1D4B, eBioscience), and DAPI. The cells were mounted on charged slides by cytospin and images captured within 48 hrs of staining. Images were analyzed using the cell function in Imaris software (Bitplane). The cell body and nuclei were detected by CD11b and DAPI staining, respectively, and Lm was detected on a per cell basis by using the vesicle function. Consistent parameters were applied to all images for unbiased Lm and LAMP-1 detection. Co-localization between these two parameters was determined for each Lm (vesicle) on a per cell basis by applying a consistent positive threshold for the mean intensity of LAMP-1 at each Lm vesicle.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise noted. <italic>In vitro</italic> Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) were normalized as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1006388.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to facilitate analysis of data pooled from independent experiments. <italic>In vivo</italic> MFIs are representative figures with at least 3 mice per group, except GFP MFIs which were pooled.
