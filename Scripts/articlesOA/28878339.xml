We reported a specific genetic risk factor through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that focused on young age onset TB. In this study, we further focused on the heterogeneity of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>) lineages and assessed its possible interaction with age at onset on host genetic factors. We identified the pathogen lineage in 686 Thai TB cases and GWAS stratified by both infected pathogen lineage information and age at onset revealed a genome-wide significant association of one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 1p13, which was specifically associated with non-Beijing lineage-infected old age onset cases (<italic>P</italic>=2.54E-08, OR=1.74 (95% CI=1.43&#x02013;2.12)), when we compared them to the population-matched healthy controls. This SNP locates near the <italic>CD53</italic> gene, which encodes a leukocyte surface glycoprotein. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>CD53</italic> was also correlated with the patients&#x02019; active TB status. This is the first report of a pathogen lineage-based genome-wide association study. The results suggested that host genetic risk in TB is depended upon the pathogen genetic background and demonstrate the importance of analyzing the interaction between host and pathogen genomes in TB.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>), is one of the three most common infectious diseases in the world. Although this pathogen infects one-third of the world population, only 5&#x02013;15% of infected people develop TB, and the infection in the remaining 90% of infected people stays in a dormant stage throughout their life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> suggesting the contribution of host genetic factors to TB onset. The contribution of host genetic factors to TB onset have been demonstrated in twin studies, in which monozygotic twins showed a 2.5 times higher chance of developing TB than dizygotic twins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p><p>To identify host genetic factors in TB, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in which differences in genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. In infectious diseases, GWAS have successfully identified risk genes with moderate to large effect size (at risk odds ratios &#x0003e;1.5). For example, <italic>HLA-DR -DQ</italic> genes and the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene have been identified as risk genes in leprosy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The sickle hemoglobin (<italic>HbS</italic>) gene in malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> and the Complement factor H (<italic>CFH</italic>) gene in Neisseria meningitides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> were also identified as risk genes. In contrast, although several GWAS in TB had been reported to date,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> no report has identified a risk gene with a moderate to large effect size.</p><p>We previously conducted an age-stratified GWAS by focusing on the heterogeneity of TB onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> After infection by the pathogen, about 5% of infected people develop TB within 2 years, and this is called primary TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Another 5% of infected people develop TB more than 2 years after their infection, and this is called reactivated TB. It is difficult to distinguish between primary TB patients and reactivated TB patients because surrogate clinical biomarkers or definite clinical definitions are not routinely available. We proposed that the age at TB onset might be one available classifier, and our age-stratified GWAS based on the classification threshold of 45 years of age found an association within chromosome 20q12 in young age onset cases. A meta-analysis in Thai and Japanese populations reached the genome-wide significance level, and its odds ratio was 1.73 for a moderate effect size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> This finding suggests that host genetic risks for TB can be affected by age at onset.</p><p>In addition to the heterogeneity of TB onset, TB has heterogeneity in its pathogen genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Based on the genomic region of difference, six major global lineages have been reported in the world. In Thailand, almost 50% of isolates were accounted for by the Beijing lineage and the remaining 50% were accounted for by East-African Indian (EAI) or other lineages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> This heterogeneity in one country provides an advantage in comparing the effect of TB lineages in the same patient genetic background.</p><p>In the present study, we collected the host genome and the pathogen genome from each patient and considered the heterogeneity of the <italic>M. tb</italic> genome. A pathogen lineage information-based GWAS of TB was conducted to assess a possible interaction between host genetic factors and the pathogen genome. Herein, we report one lineage-dependent TB risk factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Collection of TB patient samples and healthy control samples</title><p>TB patients in this study were primarily recruited from Chiang Rai province in Thailand and some patients were recruited from Bangkok or Lampang provinces. Diagnoses of pulmonary TB was confirmed by mycobacterial culture of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from each patient&#x02019;s sputum and several tests as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Any patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus were excluded from this study. The healthy control samples were recruited from the blood donors in Chiang Rai province and none of the controls had a previous history of TB disease at the time of blood collection. Blood samples and infected <italic>M. tb</italic> samples were collected and used for DNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of host genome samples and its quality control</title><p>Host genomic DNA was applied to the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip (616&#x02009;794 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) or Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 v1.2 BeadChip (964&#x02009;193 Markers for 938&#x02009;764 independent SNPs) to perform genome-wide SNP genotyping. UCSC hg19 was used as reference genome and overlapping 338&#x02009;476 SNP genotypes between two platforms were included in this study. Samples with an overall call rate of more than 98% were included and quality controls (QCs) for SNP genotypes from genome-wide genotyping were carried out using the following three thresholds: SNP call rate &#x02a7e;95%, minor allele frequency (MAF) &#x02a7e;5% and Hardy&#x02013;Weinberg equilibrium <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7e;0.001 in healthy controls. In the final analysis, 266&#x02009;604 autosomal SNPs passed the QC and were used for the association analysis.</p><p>All the samples used for GWAS applied to the identity by descent testing to find cryptic relatedness and all the remaining sample pairs after sample filtering showed the PI_HAT values less than 0.1875, which is halfway between the expected identity by descent for second- and third-degree relatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Principal component analysis (PCA) using the public Hapmap data (GSE17205 (CEU), GSE17206 (CHB+JPT) and GSE17207 (YRI)) as controls revealed that all of the Thai cases belonged to the Asian population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). As the Thai population is known to vary in its ethnicity, PCA using only the Thai samples was also performed and 1457 out of 1755 samples were selected based on the PCA result to match the genetic background between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). The 263 cases who could be tracked by their infected pathogen isolates and 282 healthy controls were included from our previous GWAS report of the Thai population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> and named as the first data set. The other 423 cases and 489 healthy controls were newly recruited in this study and were named as the replication data set. In total, 686 cases and 771 controls were included and infected <italic>M. tb</italic> information was available for all of the patients.

In short, the genomic regions TbD1, RD105, RD239, pks15/1 and RD750 of <italic>M. tb</italic> were analyzed and each isolate was classified into one of five independent lineage groups: EAI (TbD1 present, RD239 absent, also called Lineage 1); Beijing (TbD1 absent, RD105 absent, also called Lineage 2); Euro-American (TBD1 absent, 7&#x02009;bp deletion at pks15/1, also called Lineage 4); Central Asian strain (CAS; TbD1 absent, RD750 absent, also called Lineage 3); or others (TbD1 absent, the other four markers intact). Classification by spoligotyping was consistent with the PCR-based result. All of the cases in this study had a single lineage infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Regional SNP imputation analysis</title><p>An imputation method was applied to estimate genotypes in a candidate region by utilizing 1000 Genomes Project (Phase III) data as a reference panel.

Briefly, 15&#x02009;ml of whole blood samples were collected in a sodium heparin tube and sent to the department of medical sciences, Nonthaburi using overnight courier. On the next day, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) in Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). The Leucosep tube was prefilled with 15&#x02009;ml of Ficoll-Paque Plus, then 15&#x02009;ml of heparinized blood were diluted with equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline and poured into the prefilled Leucosep tube.

The 263 cases that could be tracked by their infected pathogen isolates and 282 controls were included from our previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> PCA was carried out to reduce population stratification by matching the genetic background between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1a and b</xref>).

We further considered the age at TB onset in non-Beijing lineage-infected cases, and found that association of rs1418425 was dependent on the old age onset and reached the conservative genome-wide significance level (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=5.00E-08) in the old age onset group (<italic>P</italic>=2.54E-08, OR=1.74 (95% CI=1.43&#x02013;2.12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The association of rs1418425 was not observed among non-Beijing lineage-infected and young age onset cases (<italic>P</italic>=0.115, OR=1.28 (95% CI=0.94&#x02013;1.75) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3f</xref>). These results suggest the risk of rs1418425 and this locus could be both lineage- and age-dependent. Another SNP (rs1494320), which was genotyped and in moderate linkage disequilibrium (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.59) with rs1418425 in the 1000 genome phase I Asian population, also passed Bonferroni corrected significance threshold (<italic>P</italic>=7.84E-08, OR=1.71 (95% CI=1.40&#x02013;2.08)) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, rs1494320 was located in the intronic region of <italic>CD53</italic>, a leukocyte surface glycoprotein and previously reported as a cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of <italic>CD53</italic> gene expression level in dendritic cells infected by <italic>M. tb</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p><p>During the genome evolution of <italic>M. tb</italic>, TbD1 deletion occurred and <italic>M. tb</italic> was separated into the EAI lineage (with TbD1 present, also called the ancient strain) and the non-EAI lineage (TbD1 absent, also called the modern strain). Later, non-EAI linage was further separated into the Beijing lineage and other lineages including Euro-American, CAS, etc. We therefore checked the pathogen lineage dependency of the significant SNPs by focusing on the risk allele frequencies in each lineage-infected group. This analysis indicated that both SNPs showed higher risk allele frequencies in EAI lineage-infected cases and in Euro-American lineage-infected cases than those in Beijing lineage-infected cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). This result suggests that the observed risk of these SNPs is similar between EAI and Euro-American lineages.</p><p>The most significant SNP in this study, rs1418425, was located in the intergenic region at 26&#x02009;kbp 3&#x02032; of the <italic>CD53</italic> gene and at 21&#x02009;kbp 3&#x02032; of the <italic>LRIF1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). CD53 is a leukocyte surface antigen and a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, tetraspanin. The CD53 protein is expressed mainly in the lymphoid-myeloid lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and familial deficiency of CD53 protein expression was associated with recurrent infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses, suggesting its important role in immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Ligand-dependent nuclear receptor interacting factor 1 (LRIF1) is a nuclear protein that is known to be involved in the inactivation of the human X chromosome;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> however, its function in immunity is unknown. SNPs around <italic>CD53</italic> gene and <italic>LRIF1</italic> gene constructed mild linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Thai samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We then analyzed the gene expression of <italic>CD53</italic> and <italic>LRIF1</italic> in published blood transcriptional profiling data sets of human tuberculosis patients in UK or South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The expression of <italic>CD53</italic> was significantly increased in active TB patients compared with healthy controls and its increased expression was suppressed when the treatment of TB patients progressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4a</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of <italic>LRIF1</italic> was not significantly changed in active TB patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4a</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>CD53</italic> gene expression in active TB patients was even higher than that in latent TB patients and the increased expression of <italic>CD53</italic> was consistent among the UK and South African populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4b and c</xref>). Again, these increased expression levels were not observed for <italic>LRIF1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4b and c</xref>). These results suggest that the expression of <italic>CD53</italic> gene can be correlated with the patients&#x02019; active TB status. We further analyzed the cell surface expression of CD53 antigen in Thai TB patients&#x02019; blood. Multi-color flow cytometry analysis revealed that the surface expression of CD53 on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in TB patients were increased compared with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4d</xref>). The increased surface expression of CD53 in TB patients was not observed on CD14+ monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4d</xref>). These results suggest that surface protein expression of CD53 can be increased in TB patients on T lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we first conducted pathogen lineage-based genome-wide association studies and identified two SNPs around <italic>CD53</italic> that are a significant risk for old age TB onset under non-Beijing lineage-infected conditions. These SNPs did not show an association under Beijing lineage-infected conditions, indicating the lineage-dependent risk of host genetic factors. Previous studies using a candidate gene approach have revealed several lineage-dependent host risk factors. To date, variants in <italic>TLR2</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>

<italic>MTOR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> and class I <italic>HLA</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> have been reported to show a correlation between human genotype and pathogen lineage. However, the sample size in those studies was limited and no study was performed to assess their reproducibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to analyze the interaction between host genome variation and pathogen genome variation at a genome-wide level and to show an association at a genome-wide significance level. The odds ratio of the most significant SNP observed in this study was 1.74, at moderate effect size. We assume that heterogeneity of the pathogen genome is one factor that is responsible for the current lack of identification of genetic risk factors for TB with moderate to large effect size. Indeed, the genome variation of the <italic>M. tb</italic> is six times higher compared with that of <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, the pathogen in leprosy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> We propose that consideration of pathogen genome information is necessary to further understand the pathogenesis of TB.</p><p>We showed that the risk of a host genetic factor can differ depending on the lineage of <italic>M. tb</italic>. Phenotypic differences between individual lineages have been suggested from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using clinical isolates from each lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Beijing lineage isolates were reported to induce lower levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and chemokine ligand 1 in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells than clinical isolates from the EAI lineage, the Euro-American lineage, the CAS lineage and a reference strain H37Rv that originated from the Euro-American lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> As pro-inflammatory cytokines are important mediators of a protective immune response against the pathogen, these phenotypic differences can affect the risk of host genetic factors. In this respect, it is interesting that CD53 was reported to be an important regulator of innate tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; levels in genome-wide linkage analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> In this study, we simply considered the pathogen lineage information. EAI and Euro-American lineages have an intact RD105, which is a 3.5&#x02009;kbp region that includes four genes (Rv0071&#x02013;0074), whereas RD105 is deleted from the Beijing lineage. The functions of Rv0071&#x02013;0074 in <italic>M. tb</italic> are currently unknown. Further genome-wide searches of pathogen genome variant(s) that increase the risk of identified host SNP alleles will help to identify the causative variation from the pathogen genome.</p><p>We revealed <italic>CD53</italic> gene as a non-Beijing lineage-dependent TB risk factor in old age onset cases, which we assumed are reactivated-TB cases. The <italic>CD53</italic> gene expression was increased in the active TB patients&#x02019; blood compared with healthy controls and latent TB patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4a&#x02013;d</xref>). The most significant SNP in this study, rs1418425, located at 3&#x02032; region of <italic>CD53</italic>, thus this SNP might affect the <italic>CD53</italic> gene expression through the modulation of enhancer function in this locus. The eQTL analysis in whole blood revealed that risk allele of rs1418425 can increase the endogenous expression level of <italic>CD53</italic>, consistent with the increased expression of <italic>CD53</italic> in active TB patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). We investigate the regulatory effect of rs1418425 and other SNPs in LD with rs1418425 using RegulomeDB database, which includes multiple data sources to find noncoding variants that are likely to directly affect binding of transcription factors;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> however, no functional evidence (Category 1 or 2 in RegulomeDB) was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). So far, functional consequence of these SNPs need further validation. Interestingly, another significant SNP, rs1494320, was reported as the cis-eQTL of the <italic>CD53</italic> gene in dendritic cells infected by <italic>M. tb</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> The mycobacterium-infected conditions might affect the variabilities in the inducible <italic>CD53</italic> expression level through the transcription factor binding which was not detected under normal condition and contribute to the difference in risk for TB onset. Several possible mechanisms for TB onset can be speculated from the reported functions of CD53, such as, (1) modulation of cytokine responses, (2) protection against oxidative stress and (3) regulation of class II HLA molecule cellular distribution. Regarding the first mechanism, knock down of the <italic>CD53</italic> gene increases inflammatory cytokine production by human monocyte cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> and treatment of neutrophils with tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; downregulates the presence of CD53 antigens on the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> These reports indicate a role for CD53 in the modulation and suppression of inflammatory responses. Higher expression of CD53 under infected conditions could result in weaker inflammatory responses in leukocytes and the progression of pathogen survival. Regarding the second mechanism, CD53 has been reported to protect macrophages against oxidative stress through elevated intracellular levels of reduced-glutathione (GSH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> As reduced-GSH is important for cellular defense against apoptosis from increased oxidative stress, CD53 may contribute to the modulation of cellular apoptosis. Thus, higher expression of CD53 under infected conditions could result in stronger protection against apoptosis and further progression of necrosis, which is another form of cell death that allows <italic>M. tb</italic> to escape from their host cells and infect new cells. Interestingly, GSH redox is also related to human aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Measurement of GSH redox in the plasma of healthy individuals aged 19&#x02013;85 showed that reduced-GSH/oxidized-GSH redox was not oxidized prior to 45 years of age and was subsequently oxidized at a nearly linear rate with aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> This decreased capacity of the anti-oxidant system for GSH that occurs after 45 years of age corresponds well with our observation that the risk of <italic>CD53</italic> is specific for patients who are older than 45 years of age. Finally, regarding the third mechanism, CD53 has been reported to co-localize with class I and class II HLA molecules at the surface of B cells and dendritic cells and to change their subcellular localization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Class II <italic>HLA</italic> was recently reported as a genetic risk factor for TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Thus, higher CD53 expression could result in a different cellular localization of HLA molecules and a different recognition pattern of the pathogen by HLA molecules. Whether the higher expression of <italic>CD53</italic> in active TB patients depends on the Non-Beijing lineage-infected condition and old age onset cases remains to be validated. Future <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using monocyte/macrophage cells with each genotype of associated SNPs and clinical isolates from each pathogen lineage will also help to determine the lineage-dependent mechanism of the <italic>CD53</italic> gene and its risk alleles.</p><p>We identified the non-Beijing lineage-dependent risk of rs1418425 and rs1494320, which are in mild LD in a Thai population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). From the perspective of the host, LD around <italic>CD53</italic> and <italic>LRIF1</italic> genes found to be weak in European (CEU) or African (YRI) compared with that in Asian (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). In this study, we observed the increased <italic>CD53</italic> expression in active TB patients&#x02019; blood in the European and African populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Considering the weak LD between rs1418425 and <italic>CD53</italic> region in these populations, further validation in the African and European populations is necessary to conclude whether rs1418425 is the causative variant for TB onset among different populations. From the perspective of the pathogen, the EAI lineage is distributed around East Africa and the Oceanic region, including the TB high burden countries of India, the Philippines, Vietnam and Myanmar. The Euro-American lineage is distributed around Europe, North and South America, and the North African region. In contrast, the Beijing lineage is predominant in East Asia, Central Asia, Russia and South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Previous genome-wide association studies in TB were conducted mainly in the African and Russian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Based on the lineage-dependent risk of the <italic>CD53</italic> gene, we expect that future replication analysis in EAI and Euro-American lineage distributed regions will confirm the association of <italic>CD53</italic> with TB onset.</p><p>Previous genome-wide association studies of TB reported several risk loci at chromosome 18q11.2 and 11p13, and risk genes of <italic>ASAP1</italic>, class II <italic>HLA</italic> and <italic>MAFB</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> We recently showed that the risk of class II <italic>HLA</italic> alleles is dependent on the specific strain of <italic>M. tb</italic> in a Thai population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> This finding suggests that class II <italic>HLA</italic> is another example of pathogen genome-dependent host genetic risk factors. Although our sample size was limited to detect a significant association, we observed that rs6071980 which we previously reported as a young age onset TB associated SNP in a Thai population showed non-Beijing lineage-dependent association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S5 and S6</xref>). Additionally, risk of rs2057178 on chromosome 11p13 and rs4331426 on chromosome 18q11.2 showed non-Beijing lineage dependency and EAI lineage dependency, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). These observations suggest that consideration of the heterogeneity of the pathogen genome is vital for identification of consistent genetic risk factors for TB among different populations.</p><p>In this study, significant and lineage-dependent association of <italic>CD53</italic> locus with TB onset was identified from the pathogen lineage-based GWAS. As CD53 is a modulator of inflammatory responses, and the ability of non-Beijing lineages to induce inflammatory responses differs from that of the Beijing lineage as discussed above, specific interaction between CD53 function and non-Beijing lineages seems a promising possibility. In addition to the GWAS through the division by Beijing lineage and non-Beijing lineage, we have conducted the GWAS through the division by EAI lineage- and non-EAI lineage with each age stratification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3g&#x02013;l</xref>). Although additional significantly associated loci have not been identified, we listed SNPs whose association was suggested to be lineage-dependent (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1.00E-05) and replicated in our independent data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). This list includes an intronic variant of <italic>EBF1</italic> gene, which was previously reported from a GWAS in an Indonesian population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> and a missense variant of the <italic>AGER</italic> gene, whose association with pulmonary function was reported in a previous GWAS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Further meta-analysis using our SNP list shall identify other lineage-dependent genetic risk factors and contribute to determination of the mechanism of TB onset. More detailed subgroup analysis based on the pathogen genome variations will also help facilitate the identification of host genetic factors that are significantly associated with TB from the loci that are suggested to be associated in this study. We expect these future analyses considering the heterogeneity of the pathogen genome can provide a clue to identify the consistent genetic risk factors for TB among different populations and contribute to the effective control of TB.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the participants in this study.
