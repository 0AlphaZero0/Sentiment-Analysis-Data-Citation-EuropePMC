These changes lead to diminished ability of the immune system to generate protective responses to immunological threats, predisposing older adults to infection and raising the risk of many chronic diseases (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dorshkind et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>). Chromatin accessibility is emerging as an essential component of gene regulation and genome stability. Moreover, changes in chromatin accessibility patterns are thought to play a critical role in human diseases (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Philip et al., 2017</xref>) and aging (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Moskowitz et al., 2017</xref>) by altering the accessibility of key proteins to regulatory regions of the genome. Despite this crucial role, assessment of chromatin accessibility in human immune cells lags behind other genome-wide measurements such as transcription or DNA modifications.</p><p>Aging-associated changes in epigenomic patterns have been reported across diverse cell types and organisms (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Rando and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Ot&#x000ed;n et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Benayoun et al., 2015</xref>). In human immune cells, transcriptomic profiling of human PBMCs and purified immune cells revealed genes that are differentially expressed with aging (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Harries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, DNA methylation studies demonstrated that human immune system aging is associated with methylation changes at specific CpG sites (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Rakyan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Martino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Horvath et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Tserel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Moskowitz et al., 2017</xref>) reported that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells go through significant chromatin changes with aging. However, whether these changes are restricted to the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population and whether analysis of PBMCs rather than purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be used to detect these changes remains to be determined.</p><p>The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2015</xref>) is a recent technology that enables genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility patterns at base pair resolution using limited cell numbers. This technology offers remarkable opportunity to define aging-associated disruptions to transcriptional regulatory programs in human immune cells with increased precision, including changes in noncoding cis-acting sequences (e.g., enhancers) and transcription factor (TF) activity. Studying chromatin accessibility in blood-derived human immune cells should provide the blueprint to better understand how transcriptional programs are disrupted in immune cells with aging and to develop potential treatments for rejuvenation. Thus, herein we profiled and analyzed chromatin accessibility and transcriptome profiles in PBMCs and purified monocytes, B cells, and T cells from 77 healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>An epigenomic signature of aging in PBMCs</title><p>PBMCs, a composite of immune cells, represent a tissue resource to assess and monitor an individual&#x02019;s immune health and responses longitudinally. We have successfully applied PBMC profiling in earlier studies as a means of identifying transcriptomic signatures of autoimmune diseases and of immune responses to infectious agents (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chaussabel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Banchereau et al., 2016</xref>). To examine aging-associated chromatin accessibility profiles, we collected blood and isolated PBMCs from 77 healthy, community-dwelling research volunteers: 51 healthy young (HY, 22&#x02013;40 yr) and 26 healthy old (HO, 65+ yr) subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Table S1). As the changes captured in PBMC epigenomes could be attributable to both differences in the frequency of certain cell types and changes in genomic patterns that are intrinsic to specific cell subsets (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>), we also examined the cell composition of PBMCs using flow cytometry from a subset of these subjects (Table S2). Proportions of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells significantly decreased with aging, consistent with age-related decline in thymus and bone marrow activity (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C). The most significant aging-associated decline was observed in the naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population (Fig. S1 C), where the percentage of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in PBMCs decreased from &#x0223c;7% to &#x0223c;3% with age (P = 1e<sup>&#x02212;04</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Epigenomic signature of aging in PBMCs.</bold> (A) Schema summarizing our study.

This approach identified 140,172 open chromatin sites (i.e., peaks) associated with 22,124 genes based on their distance to transcription start sites (TSSs). Only high-quality samples passing quality control criteria were used in downstream analyses (44 samples, 25 HY and 19 HO; Methods). Using a generalized linear model (GLM), 12,626 differentially accessible peaks (9% of those tested, false discovery rate [FDR] &#x0003c; 0.05) were identified between age groups. Of these, 6,977 showed a decrease and 5,649 showed an increase in chromatin accessibility with aging, hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;closing&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;opening&#x0201d; peaks, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analyses confirmed that differential peaks discriminated between age groups with high accuracy, where a majority of samples (42 out of 44 in hierarchical clustering) clustered based on the age group alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; Fig. S1 D).</p><p>The Roadmap Epigenomics Project (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>) profiled reference PBMC samples and defined functional states such as promoters and enhancers in these cells. To determine the location of ATAC-seq open chromatin sites (e.g., promoters, enhancers) we annotated them using these Roadmap-defined (i.e., ChromHMM) chromatin states. As expected, the most accessible peaks mostly overlapped with promoter and enhancer states (Fig. S1 E). In contrast, less accessible peaks were annotated with repressed or quiescent states (Fig. S1 E). For example, the most accessible 10% among all peaks (14,222) were mostly at promoters (55.6%) and enhancers (36.1%), whereas the least accessible 10% (14,199) were mostly at quiescent sites (61.3%). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, there was a remarkable difference in the functional annotation of differential peaks, with closing peaks mostly found at promoters and enhancers and opening peaks mostly found at repressed and quiescent sites. Moreover, closing peaks were more accessible (i.e., larger peaks) on average than opening peaks and all ATAC-seq peaks (Fig. S1 F).</p><p>Analysis of the frequency of differentially accessible chromatin regions across the cohort revealed that closing peaks consist of open chromatin sites that are common between subjects (i.e., high-frequency peaks), whereas opening peaks consist of low-frequency and often subject-specific peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Thus, examination of chromatin accessibility led to the identification of an epigenomic signature of aging in PBMCs composed of (a) chromatin closing at the most accessible promoter/enhancer regions of the genome across the population and (b) a chromatin opening of less accessible regions of the genome in a subject-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Chromatin closing at promoters and enhancers with aging</title><p>Differential peaks were annotated to the nearest gene based on their distance to TSS, thereby linking 4,567 and 3,816 genes to &#x0201c;closing&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;opening&#x0201d; peaks, respectively (see Table S3 for genes associated with differentially open peaks). Genes annotated to differentially accessible peaks were further characterized using gene ontology (GO) terms, which revealed 622 and 379 immune-related genes that are closing and opening, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

These modules are functionally characterized and linked to pathways or cell types involved in immune processes, which enabled us to systematically define transcriptional fingerprints of diverse immune diseases and responses (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Guiducci et al., 2010</xref>). We further characterized the modules with unknown functionality using ClueGO (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>) annotations (Methods; Table S5) and calculated the mean fold change for immune module genes, where negative numbers represent chromatin closing with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, blue bars) and positive ones represent chromatin opening with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, red bars). This analysis revealed a systematic loss of chromatin accessibility at the promoters and enhancers of immune module genes. This loss was accompanied by a gain of chromatin accessibility around these genes at loci classified as repressed or quiescent by the Roadmap (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>) profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), consistent with observed genome-wide patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Modular analyses of the chromatin accessibility data revealed that the T cell module genes exhibit the most significant chromatin closing with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, first row). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> shows that at the subject level, most genes in the T cell module exhibited chromatin silencing with aging, resulting in a striking separation of subjects into their respective age groups based on the chromatin accessibility of these genes. Focusing on the genes within the inflammation I module revealed that aging has a dual effect on inflammation-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). A set of inflammation-related genes are repressed via chromatin closing mostly at their enhancers, including hypoxia-inducible factor <italic>HIF1A</italic>, which modulates hypoxia responses in immune cells (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Palazon et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, a mutually exclusive gene set was associated with chromatin opening mostly at quiescent sites, including <italic>DUSP10</italic>, a molecule that is known to play an essential role in local and systemic inflammation (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2006</xref>). A gain in chromatin accessibility was not detected around the IL-6 molecule, a key mediator of systemic inflammation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ershler and Keller, 2000</xref>), suggesting that age-associated increases in serum IL-6 levels might originate from cells other than PBMCs (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Maggio et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our analysis shows a widespread chromatin closing at promoters and enhancers related to immune functions, especially T cell functions.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>Aging-associated gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes</title><p>To link aging-associated chromatin changes to transcript levels, RNA-seq profiles of PBMCs from 39 subjects (24 HY, 15 HO) were generated to match the ATAC-seq samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> shows a significant positive correlation between age-related changes in gene expression levels and chromatin accessibility at gene promoters (r = 0.34, P &#x0003c; 1e<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>).

By applying systems immunology approaches, we defined for the first time a chromatin accessibility signature of aging-related reduced immune responses in PBMCs and uncovered genes and proteins that can serve as potential biomarkers of immunodeficiency. The signature contained simultaneous chromatin closing at promoters and enhancers associated with T cell signaling and chromatin opening mostly found at quiescent and repressed sites. Regions associated with chromatin opening were stochastically distributed across the cohort, where they were observed in a single subject or a small number of subjects. This chromatin opening might be associated with the aging-related loss of histone proteins leaving short strands of DNA accessible to the Tn5 transposase (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pal and Tyler, 2016</xref>). However, the functional significance of this observation remains to be determined. In contrast, a widespread loss of chromatin accessibility at promoters and enhancers especially affecting T cell signaling pathways was observed across all subjects. Matching chromatin accessibility and gene expression by genomic region (i.e., promoter and transcript) and by subject helped us identify immune effector molecules that exhibit concordant alterations in their expression and chromatin accessibility levels with aging. Among these molecules, a substantial number of genes related to T cell functions were silenced epigenomically and transcriptionally, most notably the <italic>IL7R</italic> gene and other genes encoding the IL-7 signaling pathway.</p><p>Chromatin accessibility profiles of purified cells revealed that this aging-related signature in PBMCs stems from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which together account for 10&#x02013;15% of PBMCs. We found that memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo a widespread silencing of promoters with aging, whereas naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibit such a loss mostly at enhancers, a dichotomy that is not yet understood. Parallels between PBMCs and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were particularly notable for genes in the T cell signaling pathways, including IL-7 signaling, where a strong chromatin closing around the promoters of these genes was observed in both PBMC and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The alteration of the IL-7 pathway might explain the loss of the homeostatic proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brice&#x000f1;o et al., 2016</xref>) as well as their reduced antigen-driven proliferation, thus curtailing responses to infectious agents and cancer cells. Indeed, when compared with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from HY adults, those from elderly individuals responded less well to IL-7, as measured by STAT5 phosphorylation. The defect in the response to IL-7 is specific to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from elderly and young individuals responded similarly to IL-7 stimulation.</p><p>A previous study established decreased expression of IL7R on naive (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>) and EMRA (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as one of the hallmarks of aging (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). However, the most dramatic impact of reduced IL7R levels, including BCL2 upregulation and STAT5 phosphorylation, was detected in the EMRA subpopulation. This has important functional consequences, as signaling initiated by IL-7 plays a crucial role in the maintenance and homeostasis of naive and memory T cells (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Schluns et al., 2000</xref>). In CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, IL-7 stimulation leads to a more homogenous response in terms of BCL2 upregulation and STAT5 phosphorylation in naive and CM subpopulations, whereas the response is more heterogeneous in effector memory (EM) and EMRA subpopulations in both young and elderly subjects (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, IL7R is an important marker of functional heterogeneity observed in mouse effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>). Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in regulating IL7R levels in human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. For example, increased DNA methylation levels have been observed around the <italic>IL7R</italic> promoter in IL-7Ra<sup>low</sup> cells in comparison to IL-7Ra<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). A similar mechanism was identified in mouse cells where the IL7R expression in memory precursor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was inhibited by HDAC1-mediated histone deacetylation of the gene promoter (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chandele et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also exhibited an epigenomic silencing of TF promoters and a loss in TF footprints with aging. This aging-associated loss of TF footprints included fast-acting factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B and STATs, which might play a role in regulating rapid T cell responses. This loss in TF footprints was particularly noticeable around the IL7R locus. A recently published study (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Moskowitz et al., 2017</xref>) similarly reported the aging-associated erosion of chromatin accessibility around gene promoters in naive and CM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and showed that aging disrupts the TF binding patterns in these cells. Similarly, chromatin accessibility changes in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been recently reported in cancer (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Philip et al., 2017</xref>). By establishing a chromatin accessibility signature of aging-related immunodeficiency and delivering potential biomarkers in PBMCs (rather than in purified cells), our study addresses a significant gap and motivates future longitudinal studies.</p><p>The epigenomic signature of aging in PBMCs described herein was robust and was associated with neither CMV seropositivity nor seasonal variation. As part of this signature, <italic>IL7R</italic> emerged as a potential biomarker of reduced immune responses, where aging-associated loss of this molecule is observed at the chromatin, transcriptome, and protein levels, especially in memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Such biomarkers could be instrumental in identifying individuals who might benefit the most from therapies to rejuvenate declining immune functions due to aging or diseases, such as HIV (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Feinberg, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, clinical studies of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) suggested a possible rejuvenation of the circulating T cell profile upon administration of rhIL-7, especially in individuals with limited naive T cells and diminished TCR repertoire diversity, as in the case of the elderly (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sport&#x000e8;s et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Chromatin accessibility profiling of immune cells for individuals would also be helpful in quantifying whether rejuvenation therapies administrated to individuals, such as rhIL-7, are effective and can lead to measurable genomic changes around relevant genes/pathways.</p><p>The demonstration that aging has a profound impact on the epigenomes of human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as presented herein and in the study by <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Moskowitz et al. (2017)</xref> opens the door to profiling of chromatin accessibility in a clinical context. In this study, we show for the first time that measuring chromatin accessibility from whole blood samples is sensitive enough to detect aging-associated changes, even if these changes stem from a subpopulation of cells. PBMCs are easy to obtain and profile; hence, this opens the door to the assessment of healthy immune system responses in diverse clinical conditions such as diseases or response to therapeutic intervention, including vaccination. Our study is the first demonstration that leukocyte chromatin accessibility profiling can serve as an integral and powerful immune monitoring tool for reduced immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s12"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13"><title>Human subjects</title><p>All studies were conducted after receiving approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Connecticut Health Center (IRB 14-194J-3).

After alignment, technical replicates were merged and all further analyses were performed on these merged data. For peak calling, MACS2 (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) was used with no-model, 100-bp shift, 200-bp extension, and broad peaks options. Only peaks called with a peak score (q-value) of 1% or better were kept from each sample, and the selected peaks were merged into a consensus peak set using the Bedtools multiinter tool (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). Only peaks called on autosomal chromosomes were used in this study. We further filtered consensus peaks to avoid likely false positives by only including those peaks overlapping more than 20 short reads in at least one sample and peaks for which the maximum read count did not exceed 500 cpm to account for regions that are potential artifacts. Finally, we excluded peaks overlapping blacklisted regions as defined by the ENCODE mappability criteria developed for DNase assays (July 2015 version; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/</ext-link>).</p><p>An additional quality control step was developed to filter out samples with a consistently poor signal, consisting of an algorithm to discover and characterize a series of relatively invariant &#x0201c;benchmark peaks,&#x0201d; defined as a set of peaks expected to be called in all samples. Samples that consistently miss calls for a significant portion of these benchmark peaks are flagged as having poor quality. A benchmark peak is defined based on three criteria: (a) that it remains approximately invariant between the two groups of interest (i.e., young and old samples); (b) that it captures a substantial number of reads; and (c) that it is called in most samples. For each peak, the absolute value of the log of the ratio of HO:HY mean normalized read counts (log fold change [logFC]) was used to assess the first criteria, whereas the maximum read count over all samples (maxCt) was used to assess the second one. In this study, a peak was considered apt for benchmarking when (a) its absolute logFC was in the bottom decile of the distribution over all peaks; (b) its maxCt was in the top decile of the distribution over all peaks; and (c) the peak was called in at least 90% of the samples. Using these parameters, 273 (out of 169,636) peaks were selected as a benchmark; only samples for which at least 95% of these peaks were called were selected for analyses, which excluded five samples from further analyses. We examined the effects of each of these parameter choices and found that the same samples were consistently chosen as poor quality for a range of values chosen to assess the benchmark criteria.

In addition to age group (old vs. young), our models included sex and the season in which the sample was collected (summer vs. winter) as covariates (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) because it was determined using PVCA (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Boedigheimer et al., 2008</xref>) that these factors account for a sizeable fraction of the variance in read counts. Furthermore, we used surrogate variable analysis (SVA; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Leek et al., 2012</xref>) to capture unknown sources of variation (e.g., batch effects, subject-level heterogeneity, variation in library preparation techniques) statistically independent from age group assignments. SVA decomposes the variation that is not accounted for by known factors such as age group or sex into orthogonal vectors that can then be used as additional covariates when fitting a model to test for differential accessibility or expression. Using the built-in permutation-based procedure in the R package sva, we chose to retain three SVs to include as covariates in the GLM for PBMC ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data analyses (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2015</xref>). Further examination of the pattern of variation captured by SVs derived from ATAC-seq data jointly seemed to capture anomalies in libraries with particularly large or small read counts and residual seasonal variation. In the case of RNA-seq data, SVs seemed to capture both differences in library size and differences in library preparation methods.</p><p>GLMs were implemented using a negative binomial link function, including both genome-wide and peak-specific dispersion parameters, estimated using edgeR&#x02019;s &#x0201c;common,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;trended,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;tagwise&#x0201d; dispersion components, calculated using a robust estimation option. Benjamini-Hochberg P value correction was used to select differentially open peaks at an FDR of 5%. To generate a set of model-adjusted peak estimates of chromatin accessibility (i.e., sex-, season-, and SV-adjusted) for downstream analyses and visualization, we used edgeR to fit a &#x0201c;null&#x0201d; model excluding the age group factor and then subtracted the resulting fitted values from this model from the original TMM-normalized reads.</p><p>An equivalent approach was used to analyze the effects of CMV seropositivity and seasonal variation (i.e., winter- vs. summer-acquired samples) in PBMC data. For CMV analysis, the subset of samples for which this information was available (i.e., <italic>n</italic> = 21, 12 HY and 9 HO) was fit to a model including sex as a factor and CMV status (positive, negative) as a blocking factor. In this analysis, the season factor was not taken into consideration because all subjects for whom CMV status was available were collected in the same season. For seasonal analysis, we used season (summer, winter) as a blocking factor. In both analyses, we tested both separately and jointly for the significance of age group by CMV status or season.

To improve confidence on these annotations, gene-based analyses were further restricted to include only peaks located within 50 kb of their corresponding TSS. ATAC-seq peaks were also annotated using gene sets provided by curated immune function&#x02013;related coexpression modules (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chaussabel et al., 2008</xref>). These gene sets comprise 28 modules defined from multiple compiled transcriptomic data sets, which were originally annotated based on expert knowledge of representative functions of the gene ensemble in each module. In this study, we have preserved and used these annotations to test for enrichment of these modules in gene sets of interest, such as the set of genes associated to chromatin peaks gaining or losing accessibility with aging. We assessed enrichment using the hypergeometric test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment for P values. In addition, we summarized the representation of GO terms among gene annotations for all peaks after solving for multiple GO annotations for the same gene by prioritizing terms according to the following order: Immunity &#x0003e; Metabolic &#x0003e; Transcription, Translation &#x0003e; Migration &#x0003e; Mitochondria &#x0003e; Axon &#x0003e; Development.</p><p>Further functional enrichment analyses were performed using ClueGO (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>) to test for overrepresentation of GO:Immune System Process terms using GO term fusion option and WikiPathways pathways (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kelder et al., 2012</xref>) among genes associated to differentially open peaks. In addition to testing for enriched gene sets, ClueGO combines GO terms and pathways into functionally relevant meta-sets based on the rate of shared genes among terms, allowing for an efficient assessment of enriched categories as well as their potential interactions, as inferred from sets of shared genes. We applied these methods separately to peaks significantly closing and opening between age groups to investigate the degree to which these two sets of peaks were associated to unique signatures. We only listed terms that are significant at a P value of 0.05 after Bonferroni step-down correction.

Genes for which at least three normalized reads per million were obtained in at least two samples were considered as expressed, and all others were removed before analysis. This resulted in a total estimate of 11,311 expressed genes in PBMCs.</p><p>We built a data set comprising paired ATAC-seq and RNA-seq samples by matching promoter peaks to the nearest gene (TSS) annotations. First, we retrieved the complete list of refSeq TSS coordinates for the hg19 genome reference (<italic>n</italic> = 34,783) and defined promoters as the regions within 1,000-bp flanks of each TSS. The final set of promoters was defined by merging overlapping flanked TSS regions annotated to the same gene (<italic>n</italic> = 34,700). We then selected ATAC-seq peaks overlapping these promoters and annotated them to the corresponding gene. Only the peak closest to the TSS was kept. Finally, the resulting data set was filtered to only include promoter peaks for genes that were transcribed, as defined above. Whenever multiple expressed genes were matched to the same promoter peak, all of them were retained for analysis.</p><p>To study the concordance between promoter accessibility and gene expression, we subdivided the space defined by aging-related fold changes derived from ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data into gene sets defined by the direction and magnitude of change along both dimensions, such as genes with both upregulated expression and increasing accessibility in elderly subjects or genes for which expression is upregulated but accessibility remains unchanged with aging. To capture enough genes to enable functional enrichment analysis of these gene sets, fold changes between HO and HY subjects for matching promoter peaks and transcripts were estimated empirically as the difference between the mean normalized values of each group and plotted against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Specifically, we defined a gene or promoter as being significantly &#x0201c;up&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;down&#x0201d; if the empirical log fold change of the HO mean relative to the HY mean was above or below zero, respectively, and if the adjusted empirical p-value was &#x0003c;0.01 for that gene. Empirical P values were computed by randomly permuting the HO and HY sample labels 1,000 times for each promoter peak and gene. Genes for which P &#x0003c; 0.01 were considered significantly different between age groups, whereas all others were considered to have &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; expression and/or accessibility relative to aging. Here, we focus on a subset of the combined accessibility&#x02013;expression gene sets generated by this method: (a) genes with both increased or (b) both decreased promoter accessibility and expression with aging and (c) genes with increased or (d) decreased promoter accessibility but stable aging-related expression. For each gene set, we tested for enrichment in immune modules and WikiPathways pathways using the hypergeometric test against a background defined by the set of genes that are expressed, as determined by RNA-seq data, or potentially expressed, as given by promoter accessibility, in PBMCs. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR multiple test correction to assess the significance of hypergeometric P values.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>TF motif and footprinting analysis</title><p>ATAC-seq data from PBMCs and T cells were scanned for TF footprints using the PIQ algorithm (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Sherwood et al., 2014</xref>). This method integrates genome-wide TF motifs (i.e., position weight matrices [PWMs]) with chromatin accessibility estimates profiled at base pair resolution to generate a list of possible footprint matches for a motif. The method also produces a probability estimate for each footprint&#x02019;s reproducibility, called the &#x0201c;purity score.&#x0201d; Here, we compiled a set of 1,273 distinct motifs comprising the curated (CORE) list available in the JASPAR 2016 database (<italic>n</italic> = 466, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaspar.genereg.net">http://jaspar.genereg.net</ext-link>) in addition to the complete set of HT-SELEX motifs made available in <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Jolma et al. (2013)</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 819). Altogether, these motifs represent binding sites for 381 distinct TFs. Before footprint calling, we merged samples belonging to the same cell type and age group to maximize our ability to find highly reproducible footprints. In addition, we used SAMtools v. 0.1.19 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) to randomly downsample aligned reads from each merged data set to approximately match the mapped library depth of the least deeply sequenced sample (i.e., 113 Mb). This normalization step is included to minimize the impact of the high correlation observed between library depth and footprint purity scores. Only footprints with a purity score of 90% or more were retained for further analysis. Finally, footprint calls were further filtered to include in analyses only those associated to TFs determined that are expressed in immune cells. Footprinting analyses are conducted by pooling young and old samples from each cell type and using random read resampling to ensure that these pooled old and young data have approximately the same sequencing depth (&#x0223c;113 million reads). Pooling individual samples from a group (i.e., CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell samples from young subjects) increases the effective library depth; this therefore allows for more controlled and robust footprinting calls and leads to an unbiased starting point for comparative analyses (no impact due to the differences in sequencing depth).</p><p>To examine the regulatory landscape of <italic>IL7R</italic>, a potential aging biomarker, we focused on footprints called on the promoter region (&#x000b1;1 kb from TSS) of this gene separately by age group and cell type. To complement this set of footprints, we also performed de novo motif discovery using HOMER by searching for motifs enriched in peaks annotated to <italic>IL7R</italic> relative to all peaks in PBMCs and T cell subsets. Each enriched motif was annotated to the best-fitting known TF, as found by HOMER, with the added requirement that the annotated TF should be expressed in the appropriate cell type. We then used the PIQ algorithm to call footprints of the enriched motifs and combined those overlapping <italic>IL7R</italic> promoters with the previously selected footprints. Finally, in addition to footprint and motif enrichment analyses, known TF motifs were retrieved for the region around <italic>IL7R</italic> TSS (&#x02212;10 kb upstream, +1 kb downstream) using the MotifMap tool (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Daily et al., 2011</xref>) at a 20% FDR.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Data availability</title><p>All sequence data (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) have been deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), which is hosted by the EBI and the CRG, under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001002605" id="urilnk2b753b9-24e4-553c-b109-effdeec046fc">EGAS00001002605</ext-link>. </p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows cell composition data and changes in these with aging.
