Still, we learn about human immunity in large extent from experimental mouse models. We propose a novel data integration approach which identifies concordant and discordant gene expression patterns of the immune responses in heterologous data sets. We have conducted experiments to compare human and murine transcriptional responses to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection in whole blood (WB) as well as macrophages and compared them with simulated as well as publicly available data. Our results indicate profound differences between patterns of gene expression in innate and adaptive immunity in man and mouse upon Mtb infection. We characterized differential expression of T-cell related genes corresponding to the differences in phenotype between tuberculosis (TB) highly and low susceptible mouse strains. Our approach is general and facilitates the choice of optimal animal model for studies of the human immune response to a particular disease.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The mouse has been the animal of choice for immunological studies for a century. It markedly broadened our knowledge of the structure and function of mammalian immune systems as well as of disease mechanisms. Despite high evolutionary pressure on immune systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and evolutionary distance between mouse and man<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the principles of the immune systems of these two species remain remarkably similar. Main discrepancies include the proportions of myeloid and lymphoid cells in blood, broader repertoire of B and T lymphocytes in human and heterogeneity in the repertoire of innate and adaptive immune signaling molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. High throughput genetic technologies have raised questions about the value of the murine system for modeling human diseases on the gene expression level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, comparison between heterologous data sets based on different technology platforms (as is the case for human and murine studies) presents a marked challenge, as the data cannot be aggregated and evaluated within a simple statistical framework such as linear modeling.</p><p id="Par3">A study by Shay <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> provided a comparison of transcriptional profiles of seven non stimulated murine and human cell lineages collected during immune development and showed that the global expression profiles of corresponding cell types are similar between the two species. In contrast, in 2014 Lin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> pointed to differences in human and murine transcriptomes. They described groups of genes that are tissue-specific or ubiquitous, and identified a subset of the latter which drives species-specific expression. In first approaches towards evaluating similarity of immune responses to specific stimuli, Seok <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and Takao &#x00026; Miyakawa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> employed the same data sets from total blood leukocytes from patients and corresponding mouse models to calculate correlations in murine and human gene expression. The outcome profoundly varied due to different biological and statistical assumptions of the two groups and resulted in contradictory verdicts about concordance of murine and human transcriptional responses. Most recently, a collection of over 5,000 immune system-specific gene sets based on publicly available data sets from mice and man was compiled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This collection facilitates access to gene modules regulated concordantly in immunologically relevant comparisons of various cell-state perturbations and diseases from either human or murine studies. Such analysis can be followed by identification of genes which drive phenotypic differences in both species.</p><p id="Par4">Yet, none of the published studies provide a universal solution to comparisons of transcriptome profiles from heterogeneous data sets. Notably, these approaches interpret lack of evidence for similarity as evidence of lack thereof, and a targeted approach aiming at detecting discordantly regulated elements of the immune response has not been attempted. The created gene collections apply exclusively to human and murine studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and the implemented solutions are based on correlation coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The drawback of such an approach is that a group of orthologous genes regulated in opposite manner (discordantly) upon infection can nonetheless show positive correlation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Reciprocally, if the definition of concordant gene expression is based on direction of regulation (up- or down-regulated) alone, the precision of the estimated changes in gene expression (in terms of confidence intervals, p-value or effect size) is not taken into account. This can result in lack of attribution of a major biological importance to genes playing crucial roles in a given disease.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we introduce a method which allows both, identifying highly concordantly as well as highly discordantly regulated gene sets between two organisms. The method is based on measuring concordance using directionality of change weighted by the magnitude of gene expression change in two heterologous data sets (for example, human and murine) and associated precision of its estimate. To this end, the approach combines a novel measure of similarity with gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis. To validate our approach, we identified modules of genes concordantly and discordantly expressed in WB during TB in human populations from different regions and two different murine TB models. We then verified whether the differences found in WB are present also in human and murine macrophages.</p><p id="Par6">Macrophages are pivotal for both innate and acquired immune responses to TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The number of macrophage precursors in blood of healthy human equals on average 200,000/ml of blood, i.e. 5&#x02013;6% of the total white cell count<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and in mice around 60,000/ml of blood, constituting around 6% of circulating leukocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Upon Mtb infection, the tissue resident macrophages engulf and constrain bacteria in the lung and recruit circulating monocytes and other leukocytes to the site of infection. This ultimately leads to formation of granulomas in humans and granuloma-like lesions in mice. Therefore, macrophages are one of the most important cell types involved in TB pathogenesis and protection.</p><p id="Par7">Blood provides an easily accessible source of information about the state of an organism and WB samples remain the primary source of biomarkers of pathology, including infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. WB cell transcriptome profiles are thought to illustrate a systemic immune response as blood contains cells and molecules of the immune system and is the carrier of metabolites between different tissues. WB cell composition in mouse and man is not directly comparable given that it varies in the ratio of neutrophils and lymphocytes (neutrophils comprise 50&#x02013;70% of human and 10&#x02013;25% of mouse WB cells, while lymphocytes comprise 30&#x02013;50% of human and 75&#x02013;90% of mouse WB cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>). However, states of infection drive changes in blood composition in both types of host, for example emergency granulopoesis and neutrophilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Murine models of TB include the highly susceptible 129S2 strain and the low susceptible C57BL/6 strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Several genetic differences between the two strains, e.g. a mutation in Casp11 locus in 129S2 strain or mutation in Nramp1 in C57BL/6 mice, contribute to the difference in susceptibility phenotype of the two strains to infection with intracellular pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, precise mechanisms of their differing resistance to TB have not been explained so far and it is speculated that they are also related to the occurrence and scale of inflammation, triggered by IFN production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The 129S2 strain succumbs to the disease within 40 days post infection (p.i.) which is strongly related to exuberant interferon (IFN) type I signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, whereas the C57BL/6 strain controls the infection for an extended period of time (between 200 and 300 days)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. During disease progression, 129S2 mice develop necrotic lesions more similar to granulomas found in man, while C57BL/6 mice form smaller, organized lesions with necrosis evident only in the very late stage of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">For these reasons we collected new data and acquired publicly available data from WB of TB patients from different geographic regions, from 129S2 and C57BL/6 mice infected with Mtb, as well as from healthy controls and compared the transcriptional responses to Mtb infection. These <italic>in-vivo</italic> data were complemented by <italic>in-vitro</italic> Mtb infection experiments with human and murine macrophages.

</p><p id="Par11">To investigate the correlations in gene expression between human and murine data sets, we first applied the methods described in Seok <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and Takao and Miyakawa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as they use correlation, a common approach to assess similarity in gene expression regulation between species. We calculated the squared Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (r<sup>2</sup>) of the maximum fold changes of all significantly differentially expressed gene pairs (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The obtained r&#x000b2; values indicated no significant correlation in the gene expression of human and murine whole blood or macrophage transcriptomic profiles upon Mtb infection (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficients (r) for genes significantly regulated in both species in each comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, this criterion resulted in a minute number of genes included in the comparison, for example 316 out of 15,004 orthologous gene pairs in the comparison of C57BL/6 mouse WB data (on day 7 p.i.) versus human cohort from South Africa (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, comparison 12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In summary, the previously described correlation-based approaches did not yield any valid conclusion regarding the relation of employed TB mouse models and human disease.</p><p id="Par12">We therefore calculated GSE based on gene modules from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, gene modules created by Chaussabel <italic>et al</italic>., Godec <italic>et al</italic>. and Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>; the latter further referred to as &#x0201c;immune modules&#x0201d;) separately for mouse and human data sets. Even though we did not detect any significant correlation between the data sets, the enriched modules in both data sets were in large extent overlapping (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>; presented is the analysis with use of immune modules), indicating that there might be functionally related sets of genes regulated concordantly. However, this phenomenon could not be meaningfully analyzed statistically, due to heterogeneity of the data. Therefore, to quantify this effect, we developed a measure to assess the similarity of gene expression regulation for each orthologous gene pair in two data sets. The measure, discordance/concordance score (disco.score) is based on the following criteria of determining concordance: (i) magnitude of gene expression change (effect size), as well as (ii) significance and (iii) direction of gene expression change. The disco.score increases proportionally to both human and murine log<sub>2</sub>FC increase (or decreases analogously), increases with the decrease of summed p-values of genes in pair, and has negative sign if the expression change has opposite direction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>; for a general formula applicable to more than two heterologous data sets see Methods: &#x0201c;Disco.score calculation and GSE analysis&#x0201d;):<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Indeed, the disco.score algorithm was able to correctly detect and classify the discordant and concordant modules (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>; Methods: - Validation of disco.score with simulated modules).</p><p id="Par20">To investigate how do the results of comparing data sets with disco.score reproduce a known biological background, we used disco.score to compare WB transcriptomic data sets from patients suffering of TB and sarcoidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Previously published analysis showed that transcriptomic regulation from both disease groups was highly similar in comparison with healthy controls. Furthermore, analysis of genes in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways revealed similar differential expression patterns in TB and sarcoidosis, including genes involved in systemic lupus erythematosus, complement and coagulation cascades, toll-like receptor signaling, and Fc &#x003b3;-receptor&#x02013;mediated phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

The identified gene sets were virtually identical in TB, sarcoidosis and modules identified after sorting the corresponding genes by decreasing disco.score (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5A</xref>).
