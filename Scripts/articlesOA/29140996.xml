The insidious onset and association with skin test anergy suggests failure of the immune system to both recognise and respond to infection. To understand the immune mechanisms, we studied genome-wide whole blood RNA expression in children with TB meningitis (TBM). Findings were validated in a second cohort of children with TBM and pulmonary TB (PTB), and functional T-cell responses studied in a third cohort of children with TBM, other extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) and PTB. The predominant RNA transcriptional response in children with TBM was decreased abundance of multiple genes, with 140/204 (68%) of all differentially regulated genes showing reduced abundance compared to healthy controls. Findings were validated in a second cohort with concordance of the direction of differential expression in both TBM (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.78 p = 2x10<sup>-16</sup>) and PTB patients (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.71 p = 2x10<sup>-16</sup>) when compared to a second group of healthy controls. Although the direction of expression of these significant genes was similar in the PTB patients, the magnitude of differential transcript abundance was less in PTB than in TBM. The majority of genes were involved in activation of leucocytes (<italic>p =</italic> 2.67E<sup>-11</sup>) and T-cell receptor signalling (<italic>p =</italic> 6.56E<sup>-07</sup>). Less abundant gene expression in immune cells was associated with a functional defect in T-cell proliferation that recovered after full TB treatment (p&#x0003c;0.0003). Multiple genes involved in T-cell activation show decreased abundance in children with acute TB, who also have impaired functional T-cell responses.

Temporal analysis of gene expression from diagnosis until recovery post treatment was performed in order to identify disease-associated, differentially expressed genes. Time-course rather than single point analysis was chosen in order to control for individual genomic background variability. To account for the temporal and between-individual variation in RNA expression levels, the temporal behaviour of each unique probe on the microarray was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model. This model allows interpolation of individual time points and prediction of missing observations, summarising each probe with a fitted line that describes the mean changes in expression levels over time across all individuals. Statistically significant probes can then be detected using the slopes of these mean lines as test statistics. Full details are given in the supplementary web methods.

We had expected to find evidence of a pro-inflammatory response (e.g. IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12) as mycobacteria are known to trigger inflammation through TLR2 and other pattern recognition receptors [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185973.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Indeed, the belief that a pro-inflammatory state occurs in TBM has been the basis of attempts to ameliorate neuronal damage with steroids and other anti-inflammatory agents [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We also expected to find evidence of T-cell activation, and evidence of an IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; response profile since patients present several weeks after primary infection, and long enough for T-cell and IFN&#x003b3; responses to have developed [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our findings of reduced T-cell responses, and absence of IFN&#x003b3; and TNF response signatures is in keeping with the clinical impression that childhood TB is an immunologically &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; disease in which mycobacterial invasion and dissemination occur without the expected host response. While the observed decrease in T cell proliferative responses could have been due to defective antigen presentation, we used a non-specific T cell mitogen, PHA, to measure proliferative and IFN&#x003b3; responses which should, therefore, have been independent of antigen presentation. The inclusion of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> antigens could, therefore, have potentially shown differing responses. Similarly, a limitation of our analysis of functional responses is the lack of other cytokine measurements, with which to confirm the observed suppression of T-cell expression since it is well-documented that IFN&#x003b3; responses are suppressed in acute TB [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Assignment of the differentially expressed genes to functional pathways revealed a remarkable pattern of reduced transcript levels for multiple genes required for T-cell activation, regulation of the cytotoxic granule mechanism, and surface proteins involved in T-cell homing and movement. This was mirrored by impaired responses of T-cells to mitogen. These results suggest that childhood TB is associated with an acquired immune defect, resulting from depression of multiple gene products required for an effective cellular response to the pathogen. Our findings of reduced expression of genes involved in T-cell cytotoxic responses provide an explanation for the reported reduction in serum granulysin concentrations in acute childhood TB [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These contrast with reported gene expression studies of adult TB in which up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes has been observed [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185973.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Berry et al [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have previously reported an RNA expression signature of adult TB in which increased expression of IFN&#x003b3; inducible genes and neutrophil genes was observed. Only 23 significantly differentially expressed genes in our childhood dataset were differentially expressed in the adult TB gene set of 312 genes (7.3%). This may reflect variation between the different arrays, but if real can be explained by the fact that childhood TB occurs after primary infection, and before T-cell immunity has developed and is distinct from adult TB, which generally presents as local pulmonary reactivation and is associated with marked inflammatory reaction. Further analysis comparing these findings to those in adults will be necessary to confirm that this is a distinct phenomenon in childhood tuberculosis and forms the basis of ongoing work.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of childhood TB and of the severe forms of disseminated disease such as TBM. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> has evolved multiple strategies for evading the host immune response [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185973.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and our finding of repression of multiple genes involved in immune recognition of the mycobacteria and killing of infected cells may indicate an under-recognised, mycobacteria-mediated evasion strategy. We have observed the same reduced expression of key immune genes in both PTB and TBM, but with the magnitude of reduced expression being greater in TBM. In childhood, and particularly in very young children, the distinction between PTB and disseminated forms of the disease is not absolute, as many young children have features of military spread and organ involvement, and progression to extra pulmonary disease is much more common than in adults. Our finding of a gradation of gene expression in PTB and TBM suggest that those with disseminated forms of TB have a more severe impairment of the immune responses required to contain infection. Differences in mycobacterial load may also account for the differences in gene expression observed between patients with PTB and disseminated disease.</p><p>It has been well established that acute TB is associated with repressed IFN&#x003b3; production [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and mycobacteria are known to suppress HLA class II expression on infected monocytes through repression of <italic>CIITA</italic> and other genes involved in antigen processing and presentation [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185973.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185973.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Failure to develop an appropriate T-cell response following primary infection in children may explain the progression of disease and dissemination to brain and other organs. It is of interest that an &#x0201c;immune paresis&#x0201d;, similar to that in childhood TB, is also observed after critical illness and septic shock and, like TB, is associated with depressed T-cell mitogenic responses, reduced IFN&#x003b3; production and cutaneous anergy [<xref rid="pone.0185973.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While the mechanism underlying immune paresis in other severe infections is unknown, the reduced expression of multiple key genes in T-cell and other immune pathways that we have observed in TBM may represent a common mechanism underlying immune paresis in other acute illnesses. In order to assess if the observed changes in gene expression were due to changes in cell number we used a computational approach (CellCODE) to compute relative differences in cell population. While this showed a reduction in CD4 T lymphocytes in TBM, and more neutophils in PTB when compared to healthy controls, the differences in gene expression were not explained by the differing cell proportions, suggesting that the changes are due to repression of gene transcription, or rapid degradation of the RNA transcripts. Future studies will be needed to address the mechanism for the changes we have observed.</p><p>Further studies of gene expression in other clinical situations where immune paresis has been observed are needed to establish if reduced gene expression is a common mechanism for impaired immune function. We speculate that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> may be exploiting a common bacterial mechanism for down-regulating host responses as an immune evasion strategy enabling intracellular survival.</p><p>Our findings have relevance to the global effort to develop improved vaccines and treatment of TB. Further studies are needed to establish whether the reduced expression of host genes is mediated by specific host or bacterial transcription factors, or through a more widespread epigenetic process that silences multiple host gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185973.s001"><label>S1 Methods</label><caption><title>Contains additional methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185973.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185973.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Contains additional tables discussed above.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185973.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185973.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Contains additional figures discussed above.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185973.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Stephen Popper (Stanford University) for helpful advice and guidance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0185973.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>van Well</surname><given-names>GT</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Paes</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Terwee</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Springer</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roord</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Donald</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
