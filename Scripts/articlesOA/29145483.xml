To define such mechanisms, we followed <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected adolescents longitudinally. Blood samples from forty-four adolescents who ultimately developed tuberculosis disease (&#x0201c;progressors&#x0201d;) were compared with those from 106 matched controls, who remained healthy during two years of follow up. We performed longitudinal whole blood transcriptomic analyses by RNA sequencing and plasma proteome analyses using multiplexed slow off-rate modified DNA aptamers. Tuberculosis progression was associated with sequential modulation of immunological processes. Type I/II interferon signalling and complement cascade were elevated 18 months before tuberculosis disease diagnosis, while changes in myeloid inflammation, lymphoid, monocyte and neutrophil gene modules occurred more proximally to tuberculosis disease. Analysis of gene expression in purified T cells also revealed early suppression of Th17 responses in progressors, relative to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected controls. This was confirmed in an independent adult cohort who received BCG re-vaccination; transcript expression of interferon response genes in blood prior to BCG administration was associated with suppression of IL-17 expression by BCG-specific CD4 T cells 3 weeks post-vaccination. Our findings provide a timeline to the different immunological stages of disease progression which comprise sequential inflammatory dynamics and immune alterations that precede disease manifestations and diagnosis of tuberculosis disease. These findings have important implications for developing diagnostics, vaccination and host-directed therapies for tuberculosis.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clincialtrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/Clincialtrials.gov,NCT01119521">NCT01119521</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>To define biological mechanisms that underlie progression of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection to active tuberculosis, we followed <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected adolescents longitudinally.

We concluded that sequential inflammatory dynamics and immune alteration precede tuberculosis disease manifestations, with important implications for developing diagnostics, vaccines and host-directed therapies for tuberculosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1021972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0641-1359</contrib-id><name><surname>Scriba</surname><given-names>Thomas Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>OPP1091720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0959-0265</contrib-id><name><surname>Ochsner</surname><given-names>Urs A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-AI087915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0641-1359</contrib-id><name><surname>Scriba</surname><given-names>Thomas Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NO1-AI95383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5760-9595</contrib-id><name><surname>Boom</surname><given-names>Henry Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NO1-AI-70022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5760-9595</contrib-id><name><surname>Boom</surname><given-names>Henry Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Global Health grants OPP1021972 and OPP1091720 and the National Institutes of Health (RO1-AI087915 and U19-AI106761).

The first of these, detected up to 18 months before TB diagnosis, included elevated expression of the signature of risk genes themselves and expression of IFN responses genes and complement activation more broadly.

Further, increases in protein levels of the inflammatory proteins Calgranulin C, alpha-1-antitrypsin, Myeloblastin, MMP9 and Ficolin-1 were temporally associated with upregulation of the inflammation transcriptomic module. Calgranulin C, and the serine proteases alpha-1-antitrypsin and Myeloblastin are involved in the neutrophil response and have been previously implicated in mycobacteria-induced inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

We were not able to establish from our data whether complement was activated through a particular pathway. Mycobacteria are able to activate complement through the antibody-dependent and antibody-independent classical pathways, alternative pathway activation and the lectin pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We observed upregulation of components consistent with activation of the classical pathway via C1q, while levels of total IgG and IgA were also upregulated in progressors. Differential abundance of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin-1 proteins in plasma also implicate activation of the lectin pathway. Finally, while a number of proteins involved in activation of the alternative pathway were elevated in progressors, these can also indicate complement activation by any pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Finally, within the most proximal 6 months before TB disease, changes in lymphocytes, including suppressed T and B cells and enrichment in neutrophils, were detected. The latter coincided with activation of tissue remodeling pathways that included elevated expression of several MMPs.

A limitation of our study is that the time of exposure and/or <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection in most progressors and controls was unknown, precluding interpretation of the events that precede establishment of <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection.</p><p>Finally, our T cell transcriptomic results demonstrate that progression was associated with modulation of the functional states of T cells, particularly suppressed expression of genes associated with the Th17 compartment [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in progressors that expressed the whole blood signature of risk for TB. Systemic expression of IFN response genes that comprise the signature of risk occurred concomitantly with Th17 inhibition. A negative correlation between type I IFN responses and Th17 responses has been reported in other systems [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This link between high expression of ISG as measured by the signature of risk of TB, and an alteration in T cell functional capacity was confirmed by analysis of an independent cohort. In South African adults who expressed the signature for risk of TB in whole blood, BCG revaccination induced significantly lower frequencies of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup> and decreased proportions of IL-17-expressing IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. A major implication of this result is that immune responsiveness to vaccination may be modulated by the inflammatory milieu associated with progression to active TB, and even other immune modulations that result in systemic persistent expression of IFN response genes, such as viral infections. Further research is required to dissect the mechanistic link between inflammatory and cellular events that may underlie this observation, and to understand the true implications of this finding.</p><p>Our study shows that sequential inflammatory dynamics precede TB disease manifestation characterized by specific alterations in blood transcriptomic, proteomic and cellular signatures. The detectable immunological and tissue remodeling perturbations observed in progressors suggest that new vaccination and drug treatment strategies and/or host-directed therapies may be required to control <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> in persons with subclinical TB disease, while identifying potential targets (and potential targets to avoid) for successful interventional approaches to prevent progression to active TB.
