The main objective of this study was to identify optimal postvaccination time points for evaluating peripheral blood RNA expression profiles in relation to vaccine immunogenicity and potential efficacy in recipients of the candidate tuberculosis vaccine M72/AS01. In this phase II open-label study (NCT01669096; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</uri>), healthy Bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin-primed, HIV-negative adults were administered two doses (30&#x02009;days apart) of M72/AS01. Twenty subjects completed the study and 18 subjects received two doses. Blood samples were collected pre-dose&#x02009;1, pre-dose 2, and 1, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 30&#x02009;days post-dose 2. RNA expression in whole blood (WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified using microarray technology. Serum interferon-gamma responses and M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to vaccination, and the observed safety profile were similar to previous trials. Two different approaches were utilized to analyze the RNA expression data. First, a kinetic analysis of RNA expression changes using blood transcription modules revealed early (1&#x02009;day post-dose 2) activation of several pathways related to innate immune activation, both in WB and PBMC. Second, using a previously identified gene signature as a classifier, optimal postvaccination time points were identified. Since M72/AS01 efficacy remains to be established, a PBMC-derived gene signature associated with the protective efficacy of a similarly adjuvanted candidate malaria vaccine was used as a proxy for this purpose. This approach was based on the assumption that the AS01 adjuvant used in both studies could induce shared innate immune pathways. Subjects were classified as gene signature positive (GS<sup>+</sup>) or gene signature negative (GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Assignments of subjects to GS<sup>+</sup> or GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups were confirmed by significant differences in RNA expression of the gene signature genes in PBMCs at 14&#x02009;days post-dose 2 relative to prevaccination and in WB samples at 7, 10, 14, and 17&#x02009;days post-dose 2 relative to prevaccination. Hence, in comparison with a prevaccination, 7, 10, 14, and 17&#x02009;days postvaccination appeared to be suitable time points for identifying potentially clinically relevant transcriptome responses to M72/AS01 in WB samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>adjuvant system</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Aeras Global Tuberculosis Vaccine Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100009342</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="60"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="11002"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Focus on the Patient</title><sec id="S1-1"><title>What Is the Context?</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious infectious and contagious disease in many areas of the world. New vaccines are required because although the currently available TB vaccine, Bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), works reasonably well in children, it does not work well in adults. What can help in the development of a new vaccine is knowing those immediate effects of vaccination that can predict how well it will work. RNA molecules represent a potent and now accessible source of information that can potentially capture these immediate effects because they reflect how vast arrays of the body&#x02019;s genes are reacting. If predictions can be made with this information, then this can shape the design of future clinical trials and potential improvements to vaccine composition.</p></sec><sec id="S1-2"><title>What Is New?</title><p>This study analyzed RNA expression in healthy young adult recipients of the candidate TB vaccine M72/AS01. The study showed that the suitable time points for measuring these immediate effects of the M72/AS01 vaccine were at 7, 10, 14, and 17&#x02009;days after vaccination. For this, a novel approach was followed in which a gene signature identified for another vaccine formulated with the same adjuvant was used as a proxy for the immune responses induced by the adjuvant. This RNA expression could be measured using the relatively small volumes associated with whole-blood (WB) samples rather than purified extracts of WB.</p></sec><sec id="S1-3"><title>What Is the Impact?</title><p>The information from this study will help streamline and strengthen the analyses of future clinical trials of the M72/AS01 vaccine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), is a major source of morbidity and mortality in disease-endemic settings, especially in adolescents and adults (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Primary human infection is often contained by the host immune response such that the infection becomes latent. However, in a minority of individuals, TB disease can occur, due either to reactivation of latent infection or to reinfection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The only available TB vaccine, BCG, is given mainly as primary vaccination at birth, and can protect children against severe forms of childhood TB including meningitis and disseminated TB. However, BCG does not fully protect against pulmonary TB, the most prevalent form of TB in adults (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, the candidate vaccine M72/AS01 is primarily being developed to protect against TB disease in adolescents and adults living in TB-endemic regions, who may or may not have latent Mtb infection (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). M72/AS01 contains the M72 antigen, a recombinant fusion protein derived from the Mtb proteins Mtb32A and Mtb39A, and the Adjuvant System AS01 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). M72/AS01 has been shown to have a clinically acceptable safety profile in healthy subjects, and to induce humoral M72-specific antibodies and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Although there are no known immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection against TB in humans, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell effectors, and the cytokines interferon-gamma (IFNG) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha may play a role in protection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In vaccine clinical trials, antigen-specific T-cell frequencies and antibody concentrations are typically used to interpret responses to vaccination. However, in clinical and preclinical studies in which BCG confers protection against Mtb from natural infection or experimental challenge, T-helper 1 (T<sub>h1</sub>) cell responses to BCG are at best poor predictors of protection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Therefore, alternative approaches are needed for the identification of TB vaccine correlates of protection (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These alternative approaches also should recognize that in large field efficacy trials, logistics prevent frequent sampling and lengthy processing of high blood volumes for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparation thus favoring immunological assessments to be made directly from small blood draws.</p><p>In this context, systems biology analyses have begun to provide additional insights into TB pathology (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Analyses of WB transcriptome data have identified gene signatures which were associated with active TB (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and which are sensitive to successful treatment (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Systems biology approaches on blood-derived data have also been used to evaluate clinical responses to several different vaccines, including the live-attenuated vaccines (rubella, smallpox, yellow fever), a live-recombinant vaccine (adenovirus/HIV-1), and non-live vaccines (inactivated-influenza vaccines, polysaccharide-based meningitis vaccines, and pneumococcal vaccine) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In those studies, gene signatures have been associated with a known adaptive immune profile, or a putative protective immune function. Some of those signatures include interferon-inducible genes and have been identified in WB or PBMCs within 7&#x02009;days after vaccination (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In two recent studies, gene signatures associated with protective efficacy have been identified for the candidate malaria vaccines RTS,S/AS01 and RTS,S/AS02 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Those signatures also have potential relationships with IFNG signaling.</p><p>The objective of this study was to identify those postvaccination time points for WB sampling that could be relevant for evaluating M72/AS01 in future clinical studies, especially in efficacy studies. Given that M72/AS01-mediated protection has not been established yet, there is no associated gene signature that could inform the time point selection. Hence, it was decided to test a novel approach and use an alternative gene signature that was hypothesized to reflect AS01-induced immune activation as a proxy to measure the immunological diversity in transcriptome profiles as a function of time. In parallel, changes in RNA expression in PBMC and WB were analyzed using blood transcription modules (BTMs) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which provide an important tool for transcriptomic analysis. This BTM analysis provides a broad description of the responses induced after vaccination.</p><p>The specific gene signature that was used as a proxy was identified from PBMC RNA expression (transcriptome) data from recipients of the candidate malaria vaccines RTS,S/AS01 or RTS,S/AS02 in a vaccine efficacy study (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In that study, vaccinated subjects underwent controlled challenge with malaria sporozoites, 14&#x02009;days after the third and final dose. The results suggested that RNA expression of the specific gene signature (referred to as the RTS,S signature) between the 3rd and 14th day after the 3rd dose, rather than the day of or the day after the 3rd dose, contributed most to discriminating between protection and non-protection after challenge. Thus in the present study, the transcriptome data were used as an immunological readout, classifying subjects as gene signature positive (GS<sup>+</sup>) or &#x02013;negative (GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Positive- or negative gene signature would thus correspond to an RNA expression profile formerly associated with protection or non-protection, respectively, against malaria sporozoite challenge after vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 or RTS,S/AS02.</p><p>Two assumptions were made to justify the use of the RTS,S gene signature in this M72/AS01 vaccination study. First, the RTS,S gene signature was driven by an interaction between innate and adaptive responses to vaccination, including the innate responses to the immunostimulants MPL and QS-21, which are constituents of AS01 and AS02 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Hence, the RTS,S gene signature would be used as a proxy for different types of immune response to a vaccine with an adjuvant containing MPL and QS-21, M72/AS01. Second, the time window for the analysis of 7&#x02013;17&#x02009;days after vaccination and relative to baseline would best capture interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccination. Therefore, this time window would not necessarily coincide with a period when changes in gene expression were at their greatest magnitude, which perhaps would be expected 1&#x02009;day after vaccination (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). No assumption was made concerning the relationship between positive and negative RTS,S gene signatures and potential protection against TB because the pathology of TB is obviously different to that of malaria.</p><p>The impact of the different structural properties of the RTS,S antigen (virus-like particle) and M72 (soluble protein) could be an important determinant of the success of this approach. If the response induced by the different antigens has an important impact on the gene signature, then it will be unlikely to find evidence supporting the validity of using the gene signature for M72/AS01. If on the other hand, the gene signature is predominantly driven by the adjuvant components, then this study could potentially provide supportive evidence.</p><p>Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the kinetics of RNA expression relative to baseline up to 17&#x02009;days after two doses of M72/AS01 using BTMs and to determine the most informative time point or time window between 7 and 17&#x02009;days postvaccination for the collection of WB samples for RNA expression analyses using the RTS,S gene signature. Because the RTS,S gene signature was derived from PBMCs, the assessment of RNA expression in WB was compared with the assessment made in PBMCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3-1"><title>Study Conduct and Design</title><p>This open-label study (NCT01669096) was conducted at the Centre for Vaccinology (CEVAC), Ghent University Hospital, Belgium, between August 2012 and May 2013.

At each of the time points, about a half of the subjects evaluated (8/17 or 10/17 [Day 47]) were assigned to the GS<sup>+</sup> group. However, only three subjects were consistently assigned to the GS<sup>+</sup> group and three subjects were consistently assigned to the GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> group. For Cluster-B probe sets, the assignments to the GS<sup>+</sup> and GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups presented significant differences in overall mean RNA expression levels at all time points, and with high bootstrapping frequencies (84.4% [Day 47] to 100% [Days 40 and 44]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

However, a superiority of one sampling time point over the others was not obvious. Although for the 17-day time point in contrast to the other time points, the assignments to GS<sup>+</sup> and GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups were confirmed by both Cluster-A and Cluster-B probe sets, the three statistical measures for group assignments using the Cluster-B probe (<italic>p</italic> value, bootstrapping frequency and Monte&#x02013;Carlo frequency) were relatively inferior to those for the other time points.</p></sec><sec id="S4-6"><title>Group Assignment and Immunogenicity</title><p>The genes represented in the Cluster-A and Cluster-B probe sets included those genes associated with the IFNG pathway and potentially with lymphocyte function (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

This study represents a preliminary step in the incorporation of transcriptome data analysis into subsequent M72/AS01 clinical trials. Moreover, as with previous studies in healthy adult subjects, M72/AS01 had an acceptable safety profile (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and no safety concerns were identified.</p><p>To analyze the RNA expression data, two different approaches were utilized. First, a kinetic analysis of RNA expression changes using BTMs revealed early (1&#x02009;day post-dose 2) activation of several pathways related to innate immune activation, both in WB and PBMC. Second, a novel approach was followed to identify optimal postvaccination time points using a previously identified gene signature that was hypothesized to reflect AS01-induced immune activation as a classifier. Because gene signatures associated with potential M72/AS01-mediated protection have yet to be determined, a gene signature associated with RTS,S vaccine-mediated protection against malaria (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) was used as a proxy to measure the immunological diversity in transcriptome profiles as a function of time. Although the use of a gene signature from a different vaccine as a reference was a limitation of the study, the gene signature&#x02019;s relevance was based on it potentially capturing differing responses to the two immunostimulants, MPL and QS-21, that are used in the adjuvant systems for the candidate malaria vaccines (RTS,S/AS01 and RTS/AS02) and in M72/AS01. Because of the differences between malaria and TB disease, it was considered as overly speculative to explain the relevance of the proportion of vaccine recipients assigned to one or the other of the groups, or to explain the association between group assignment and the potential for protective responses against TB.</p><p>The conclusions of the study were limited by the study&#x02019;s small size and that the cohort included only healthy BCG-vaccinated Quantiferon-negative adults resident in Belgium. Nevertheless, the RNA expression data analysis allowed two conclusions. First, the results of BTM enrichment analysis revealed that the early response to vaccination is characterized by activation of several pathway linked to innate immune activation. This transcriptomic response was transient and was succeeded by activation of BTMs related to adaptive immune responses. Second, this study demonstrated that RNA expression of a set of genes potentially relevant to the mode of action of the vaccine adjuvant could be used to discriminate different responses to the M72/AS01 vaccine using WB samples. These samples could be taken at 7, 10, 14, and 17&#x02009;days postvaccination. Hence, transcriptome analysis of WB RNA at the same sampling time points may be relevant to evaluate immunogenicity, safety, and possibly protection, in the future M72/AS01 trials. The dynamic regulation of specific BTMs in the current study was similar to what has been observed in PBMC transcriptomes of recipients of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These results support the argument that there are shared pathways induced by the immunostimulants in the AS01 and AS02 adjuvant systems and a common mode of action. Indeed, in both studies and 1&#x02009;day after the second dose, pathways related to interferon signaling/antiviral sensing and dendritic cell and monocyte phenotypes were upregulated and phenotypes related to T cells and NK cells were downregulated. With the WB samples, the phenotypes identified by BTMs were similar but not as extensive as those identified in PBMC samples at the comparable time point of 1&#x02009;day after the second dose. At 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;days after the second dose, phenotypes related to the cell cycle, and to CD4 T cells, B cells, and plasma cells were upregulated. These phenotypes also suggested a transition from innate to adaptive responses to vaccination. In AS01 mode of action studies in mice, AS01 enhances adaptive immune responses to the vaccine antigen by triggering innate immune activity at the injection site and draining lymph node including the transient release of cytokines, the transient release of IFNG (which can also be detected in peripheral blood), the recruitment and activation of monocytes and dendritic cells, and more effective antigen presentation by dendritic cells (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Elsewhere, it has been suggested that antigen-specific lymphocytes can be mobilized into the circulation by 7&#x02009;days (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The RTS,S gene signature analysis revealed that subjects can be classified in GS<sup>+</sup> and GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups. Hence, there are distinct different responses to M72/AS01 (marked by positive or negative gene signatures) that may reflect, in part, differences in innate immune activity triggered by AS01 and subsequent differences in adaptive immunity.</p><p>At the other comparable time point of 14&#x02009;days after the second dose, assignments to GS<sup>+</sup> and GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups were confirmed only by Cluster-B probe sets in WB, but by both Cluster-A and Cluster-B probe sets in PBMCs. These differences may reflect that a greater level of variation in RNA expression associated with a more heterogeneous population of WB cells versus a purified (mononuclear) subpopulation of those cells with presumably, a lower prevalence of Cluster-A confounding cell types. These differences may also reflect that the reference gene signature, in being derived from PBMCs, was better suited to identifying significant difference in PBMCs and not WB from the M72/AS01 recipients. Hence, in WB samples, the consistency of subjects being assigned to the same GS group (GS<sup>+</sup> or GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) at the 4 time points may have been compromised by using Cluster-A probe set data. Nevertheless, the study suggested that potentially relevant transcriptome information can be retrieved from WB samples. And this is supported by other studies where potentially relevant biological differences have been identified with systems biology analyses of WB samples in TB disease (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and in the evaluations of other vaccines (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>No consistent association was observed between the preferential assignment to the GS<sup>+</sup> group and higher IFNG concentrations or higher M72-specific immune marker poly-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies postvaccination. Overall, the increases after vaccination in serum IFNG concentrations, and in the frequencies of M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with an immune marker poly-positive and T<sub>h</sub>1-bias phenotype were in agreement with earlier studies of the M72 vaccine in adults (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The detection of M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells prevaccination presumably reflected the immune memory of BCG vaccination or possible cross-reactive non-Mtb mycobacteria exposure (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); and an immune memory may have contributed to the continued elevation of serum IFNG concentration 7&#x02009;days after the second dose (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>).</p><p>The suitability of the sampling time points 7, 10, 14, and 17&#x02009;days postvaccination, suggested by GS<sup>+</sup>/GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> assignment had little correspondence with the numbers and types of BTMs identified at those time points. The potentially and relatively superior 17-day postvaccination time point by GS<sup>+</sup>/GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> assignment was associated with fewer BTMs than the 7-day postvaccination time point; and no BTMs were identified at the 14-day postvaccination time point. Two explanations can be envisaged. First, the absence of any clear relationships between BTM and GS analyses may be linked to the fact that none of the 25 Cluster A genes and only 4/37 Cluster B genes were represented in the 41 identified BTMs (i.e., <italic>IRF7, NCF1C, MYD88</italic>, and <italic>PML</italic>). Second, differences in gene expression that are related to differences in immunogenicity or protection status may not necessarily coincide with those time points in which gene expression levels relative to baseline (as measured by BTM analysis) is maximally increased or decreased. This has been observed in recipients of the RTS,S vaccine (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), where NK-cell-related BTMs were negatively correlated with protection and immunogenicity on the day of the third RTS,S/AS01 dose, even though a significant downregulation was not detected on the same day (but was detected the day after).</p><p>In summary, M72/AS01 had an acceptable safety profile and was immunogenic in the small study population of healthy adults. All four time points evaluated (7, 10, 14, or 17&#x02009;days postvaccination) in comparison with a prevaccination time point, appeared suitable for identifying potentially clinically relevant transcriptome responses to M72/AS01 in WB samples. Hence on condition that an appropriate reference gene signature can be identified, the approach taken in this study to use a gene signature associated with shared immune pathways, possibly reflecting a common mode of action, as a proxy for the induced immune response should also be suitable for other vaccine clinical studies that address the same type of objective.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This open-label study (NCT01669096) was conducted at the Centre for Vaccinology (CEVAC), Ghent University Hospital, Belgium, between August 2012 and May 2013.
