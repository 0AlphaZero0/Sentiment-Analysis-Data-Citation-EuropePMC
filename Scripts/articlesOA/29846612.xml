From February 2013 to October 2017, 1564 patients with H7N9 disease were reported, 612 of whom died, resulting in an overall case-fatality ratio of around 38% [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The infection can rapidly progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. H7N9 virus pathogenesis was caused by multiple factors, including high viral replication, virus tropism for the lower respiratory tract, and dysregulation of the host innate immune responses [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>].

Two similar studies have recently been carried out in patients with H7N9 virus infection. However, these studies were limited by the small numbers of samples studied (4 and 8 samples) and by a lack of association with detailed clinical parameters including viral load [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We aimed to identify host transcriptome responses associated with clinical and virological outcomes in patients with influenza A H7N9 infection in comparison with healthy controls.

Day 1 of clinical onset was defined as the first day of the appearance of clinical symptoms. The dates of admission, age, and clinical outcomes of these patients are tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; and clinical and immunological features of some of these patients have been reported previously [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Command Console Software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to control the scanner and summarize probe cell intensity data (CEL file generation) with default settings. The raw data were then normalized by Expression Console.

Calculation of molecular distance to health (MDTH) was adapted from a previously described methodology on a gene-by-gene basis [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. MDTH outliers were defined as being 3 standard deviations away from the median. Outlier identification was performed iteratively until no further outliers could be identified.

Clinical, virologic, and immunological features of each patient were recorded in detail. Six patients (No. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) were discharged and 2 patients (No. 3 and 10) had a fatal outcome. Patients No. 1 and 5 were excluded as no sample was available for the transcriptomic study. All patients had laboratory-confirmed infection with low pathogenic influenza A (H7N9) viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using specific HA primers. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients during their hospitalization are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Clinical parameters that were used by the clinicians to assist the diagnosis and treatment were recorded on the indicated days. Viral copy numbers were determined from the throat swab (defined as an upper respiratory tract specimen) and from BALF or endotracheal aspirate (defined as lower respiratory tract). Bacteria were identified from the sputum samples in each of the patient to investigate possible bacterial coinfection. Fifteen healthy donors served as controls where we assumed the viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tracts were zero and their Pao

An overview of the data using principal component analysis showed that the gene expression profiles from the H7N9-infected patients formed a distinct cluster compared to the healthy control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The difference can be readily observed in the first 3 components, which together account for &#x0003e;50% of the variance of the data. We next computed the MDTH from each sample to see if it can be used to assess the clinical severity of the H7N9-infected patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). MDTH is a computational score derived from the full gene set of a blood transcriptomic profile and can provide a summary of overall deviation of gene expression compared to healthy controls. The use of MDTH score has been demonstrated previously to differentiate the severity of the disease in the studies such as pulmonary tuberculosis, septicemic melioidosis, and RSV infection [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We found that the MDTH scores derived from all patients&#x02019; samples were all higher than the normal controls. When we grouped the samples based on week after disease onset, the MDTH score from each week was also significantly higher than the control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Overview of the microarray data. <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic>, First 3 components (PC1&#x02013;3) from principal component analysis of the gene expression profile are plotted.

The correlations of MDTH with the values of different clinical parameters, including Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio, viral loads in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, d-dimer, and urea, which were recorded on the same day as sampling, were examined by Pearson correlation test. We found that the MDTH correlated with most of the parameters except creatine kinase and viral load in the URT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Among all the tested parameters, Pao

<sub>2</sub> ratio (Pearson correlation, &#x02212;0.73; <italic>P</italic> value 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) and viral load in LRT (Pearson correlation 0.51; <italic>P</italic> value .0012) were clearly known to associate with the pathogenesis of H7N9 virus during infection. We further aimed to identify genes from the blood transcriptomic profiles that were associated with the Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio and viral load in LRT. We first examined whether there were any genes in the profile that showed a positive or negative correlation to the Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio or viral load in LRT. Positive correlation means the expression of the gene increased when the value of the parameter increased, while negative correlation means the change in gene expression level was opposite to the change in the parameter. From our analysis, we found that there were 4788 and 2189 genes that were positively or negatively correlated with the Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio, respectively. Similarly, 565 and 1845 genes were positively or negatively correlated with the viral load in the LRT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). During infection, the lung pathology could be caused by diverse factors, including replication of the virus, immune dysregulation, or bacterial coinfection. To specifically determine the host responses that were related to both H7N9 replication and lung dysfunction, we further identified 2 sets of genes with contrasting correlation to both Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio and viral load in LRT : (1) negatively correlated to Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio and positively correlated with viral load in LRT; and (2) positively correlated to Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio and negatively correlated with viral load in LRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was based on the hypothesis that increasing viral load was likely to be associated with impaired lung function, that is decreased Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio. Set 1 represents the genes activated during the acute phase of infection (oxygen level in blood decreased and viral load at the LRT increased) or deactivated during the recovery phase (oxygen level in blood increased and viral load at the LRT decreased). On the contrary, set 2 represents the opposite condition, that is genes deactivated during the acute phase of infection or activated during the recovery phase. From our analysis, 541 and 1803 genes corresponded to sets 1 and 2, respectively.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Correlation between molecular-distance-to-health (MDTH) and clinical parameters: <italic>A</italic>, Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2 ratio</sub>; <italic>B</italic>, lower respiratory tract (LRT) titer; <italic>C</italic>, upper respiratory tract (URT) titer; <italic>D</italic>, procalcitonin; <italic>E</italic>, hemoglobin; <italic>F</italic>, d-dimer.

In the acute stage (Pao

Interestingly, although differential biological processes were found from these gene sets in the acute phase of infection, T-cell&#x02013;related functions and metabolic processes were both enriched at the recovery phase (data not shown).</p><p>We then performed KEGG pathway analysis from the 2 overlapping gene sets between Pao

The results were then correlated with &#x0201c;time&#x0201d; and the changes were characterized during the disease progression. However, we believed that phenotypic measurements (ie, clinical parameters) are a more reliable assessment for the condition of a patient because one could expect that progression of a disease is likely to vary among individuals. In respiratory infection, the Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio measured in the blood and the viral load in the respiratory tract are both useful quantitative parameters to determine disease severity [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One technical advantage of our approach is that samples do not need to be collected at fixed time points after admission, which is anyway not correlated with the time after onset of disease. Instead, the use of clinical parameters can enable a correlation analysis by pulling together all time points from all individuals. Two patients had a fatal outcome and both of them required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, we did not find genes or MDTH that were associated with, or predictive of, this outcome. Indeed, the disease outcome of a patient can be affected by multiple factors, including the clinical practice, response to the treatment, secondary infections, or unexpected complications. The transcriptomic host responses associated with a fatal outcome need to be identified by a larger cohort with similar sample collection criteria. Our analysis, therefore, has the limitation that it does not provide predictive host responses that are associated with an adverse outcome. Instead, our approach analyzed and identified gene expression associated with 2 key clinical parameters: Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> and viral load in the LRT, which are closely related to disease severity but may not invariably be linked to disease outcome (recovered patients can also have low Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> value and high viral load at some stages of their illness). We found that MDTH correlated well with viral load at the LRT but not in the URT, which is understandable for a virus such as H7N9 that causes a primary viral pneumonia. Because dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines has been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of avian influenza H7N9 in humans and experimental animal models, it would be interesting to examine possible correlations between cytokine responses in plasma and gene expression levels (as well as MDTH) in blood in future studies [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref>].</p><p>Our data showed that the activities of neutrophil during the acute phase of infection were associated with the viral infection. Neutrophils are involved in various lung diseases [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A neutrophil response has long been considered a marker of bacterial infection [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, rapid recruitment of neutrophils to the lung was seen in naive mice after nasal inoculation with avian influenza viruses [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These results suggest that infection with avian influenza viruses can also lead to recruitment and activation of neutrophils in the lung. Our study found that <italic>CD177</italic> was the most sensitive to both the Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> ratio and the viral load in LRT. CD177 (NB-1) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, which is responsible for mediating the migration, degranulation, and superoxide generation by neutrophils during inflammation [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 8, 9, and 25 were also found during the acute phase of H7N9 infection. A case-control study indicated that mRNA levels of MMP8 and MMP9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased in children with LRT infection compared to healthy subjects [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has been shown that MMP9 plays a role in regulating phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production in neutrophils [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is also interesting that cell cycle-related processes were strongly associated with the change in viral load in the lower lung during H7N9 infection. A previous transcriptomic study also noted cell cycle perturbations in the peripheral blood specimens collected from patients with severe seasonal influenza infection [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although cell cycle pathways were also found to be activated in other studies, their significance was masked by other biological processes such as bacteria-related or immunological pathways when the data were analyzed without association with specific clinical parameters, as has been done in this study [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our results suggest that activation of cell cycle processes maybe a hallmark of severe influenza virus infection.</p><p>Interferons and interferon-activated pathways are important to control viral infection. A clinical study in seasonal influenza virus infections showed that activation of these pathways was reduced dramatically at around day 6 after disease onset [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our study could not identify significant activation of interferon related pathways (with the exception of IFI27) even though we could still clearly observe virus shedding in the lower lung. Thus, our findings are compatible with interferon pathways being activated at early stages of infection but being downregulated fairly quickly. However, it should be noted that we did not have specimens available for transcriptomic analysis in the first week of illness. Specimens collected earlier in the course of illness will be needed in order to test this hypothesis. Interestingly, a previous blood transcriptomic study from 4 H7N9 patients (with 1 sample from each patient) showed a GO enrichment of &#x0201c;Suppression by virus of host interferon receptor activity (GO:0039511)&#x0201d; [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, that study did not provide details on day of illness in relation to sampling and data on severity of illness were lacking. Thus we could not make a direct comparison with our data. While studies using animals such as mice and macaques all showed that H7N9 could effectively trigger the interferon pathways in the lung during the early stage of infection [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref>], it is also possible that interferon activities were only localized in the lung of the patients during the H7N9 infection.</p><p>A recent study has shown that the expression of the gene <italic>IFI27</italic> is upregulated in seasonal influenza infection and is a biomarker that discriminates influenza from bacterial infections [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We therefore specifically looked for the expression of <italic>IFI27</italic> in our data set. Expression of <italic>IFI27</italic> and the related <italic>IFI27L1</italic> were two of the interferon pathway-associated genes that were upregulated in our cohort of H7N9 infected patients. It was negatively correlated with Pao
<sub>2</sub>/Fio
<sub>2</sub> (gene expression increases with lower lung oxygenation) and a positively correlated with higher virus load in the LRT. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>IFI27</italic> was not correlated with PCT. <italic>ILI27</italic> has been reported to be expressed primarily by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in response to viral infection [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that patients with H7N9 disease who were discharged earlier from hospital had better T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell recruitment and antibody induction [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our transcriptomic analysis supported their findings in that T-cell processes including selection, differentiation, and stimulation were activated during the recovery phase of H7N9 infection. Other than T-cells&#x02013;specific genes, a group of genes from the killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily, which are expressed on the surface of T and NK cells, were also activated during the recovery stage. These proteins have been shown to regulate diverging functions of T, NK, and &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells during infection. For example, previous study have showed that V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells, which express KLRG1, can effective kill influenza virus-infected cells [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s18"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
