Our study demonstrates that alcohol enhances IFN-&#x003b1; production by CD11b+Ly6G+ cells in the lungs of young <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice, which leads to macrophage necroptosis and increased mortality.

However, limited information is available about the mechanisms involved in alcohol-mediated host susceptibility to <italic>Mtb</italic> and other intracellular bacterial infections. In the current study, we fed control and alcohol diets to young and old mice and determined the mortality rates and the immune mechanisms involved in host susceptibility to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. We found that alcohol increases the mortality of young mice but not old mice infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>. The increased mortality in alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice was due to IFN-&#x003b1; production by CD11b+Ly6G+ cells. We also found that PBMCs from young alcoholic individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) produced significantly higher amounts of IFN-&#x003b1; than those from young non-alcoholic, old alcoholic and old non-alcoholic LTBI+ individuals. Our findings suggest that young alcoholic LTBI+ individuals have a higher risk of developing active TB infection. Our studies provide the first evidence that chronic alcohol consumption induces IFN-&#x003b1; production in young <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice and increases their mortality rates. Further characterization of CD11b+Ly6G+ cells and delineation of the mechanisms through which alcohol enhances IFN-&#x003b1; production in Ly6G+ cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection will facilitate the development of therapies for alcoholic individuals with latent and active <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI054629, AI073612 and A1085135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-0207</contrib-id><name><surname>Vankayalapati</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004419</institution-id><institution>CRDF Global</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-0207</contrib-id><name><surname>Vankayalapati</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>The Cain Foundation for Infectious Disease Research</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-0207</contrib-id><name><surname>Vankayalapati</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>The Department of Pulmonary Immunology</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-0207</contrib-id><name><surname>Vankayalapati</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (AI054629, AI073612 and A1085135 to RV), CRDF global, The Cain Foundation for Infectious Disease Research and The Department of Pulmonary Immunology.

The geriatric population represents a large reservoir of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Chronic alcohol consumption impairs the host immune response to cancer and infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Our findings suggest that alcohol worsens the TB pathology in the early stage of life and leads to increased mortality.</p><p>We found that IFN-&#x003b1; is responsible for the early death of alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice. IFN-&#x003b1; is a type 1 interferon that belongs to the interferon family, which regulates the immune responses to infection, cancer and autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Type 1 interferons have a protective role during viral infections, but during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, they enhance the pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins induce the production of type 1 interferons by host myeloid cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Type 1 interferons inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; production and enhance <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in myeloid cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the current study, we found that IFN-&#x003b1; produced by Ly6G+ cells was associated with macrophage necroptosis and fatal immunopathology in the lungs of young alcohol diet-fed mice IFNAR1 signaling is detrimental during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and promotes excess inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, in the current study, we found that <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected alcohol diet-fed mice survived for a longer period of time and had less bacterial burden in their lungs when type 1 IFN signaling pathways were blocked.</p><p>Old mice express transient early resistance to pulmonary tuberculosis, and type 1 cytokines have no influence on this early resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is known that several signaling pathways are defective in old mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The transient resistance in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice is due to a population of memory CD8+ T cells that express several receptors for Th1 cytokines; in addition, in aged mice, lung macrophages secret more proinflammatory cytokines in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We have not determined the CD8+ cell and macrophage responses in alcoholic old mice; however, our results demonstrate that alcohol-fed mice were unable to enhance IFN-&#x003b1; production in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice, and there were no effects on mortality compared to the non-alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice. IFN-&#x003b1; production in young alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice significantly reduced their survival. Our current findings suggest that defective signaling pathways that are involved in the production of IFN-&#x003b1; in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice may be protecting them from alcohol-mediated lung cell necroptosis.</p><p>In various experimental models, it was shown that immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and Ly6G+ cells, produce type 1 interferons, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the major source [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, only less than 1% of leucocytes are dendritic cells, and fifty percent of blood leucocytes are Ly6G+ cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Necrosis and Ly6G+ cell infiltration in the lung granuloma are characteristic features of tuberculosis granulomas, and these properties are associated with increased mycobacterial load and exacerbated lung pathology in human and experimental animals [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Netting Ly6G+ cells are the major inducers of type I IFN production [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whole blood transcript signatures for active TB patients and pathway analyses revealed that the TB signature is dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile that consists of both IFN-&#x003b3; and type I IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Alcohol consumption can reduce the recruitment of Ly6G+ cells to the site of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We have further investigated whether IFN-&#x003b1;-producing CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells are neutrophils. We found that these cells express a unique phenotype, including some neutrophils markers (positive for CD11b, CD200 and CD163 but negative for F4/80, CD68, CD115, CD11c, and Ly6C), suggesting these cells are not neutrophils. In the current study, we found fewer CD11b+Ly6G+ cells in the lungs of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice than in those of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice. We have not determined the factors underlying the reduced CD11b+Ly6G+ infiltration in the lungs of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice, but it is known that in old individuals, the neutrophil lifespan is decreased, neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow proliferate less, neutrophil recruitment at the site of inflammation is reduced, and CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells are less functional due to alterations in signaling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Our results suggest that alcohol consumption can enhance these defects in old mice and that Ly6G+ neutrophil- like cells are unable to migrate to the lungs of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice, resulting in less IFN-&#x003b1; production and necroptosis and enhanced survival.</p><p>We found that IFN-&#x003b1; produced by Ly6G+ cells in alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice induces necroptosis in lung macrophages. Necroptosis is programmed necrosis that differs from other death pathways (apoptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis) due to the requirement of a unique signaling pathway associated with the activation of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases 1 and 3 [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Caspase 1 expression was similar among all groups of infected mice, but RIP-1 and RIP-3 expression was significantly higher in the lungs of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice than in those of control diet-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice and alcohol diet-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice. We also found that RIP-1 and RIP-3 expression was restricted to macrophages and that IFN-&#x003b1;-producing Ly6G+ cells were colocalized around macrophages. These findings suggest that IFN-&#x003b1;-producing Ly6G+ cells in alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice enhance necroptosis in lung macrophages.</p><p>Necroptosis exacerbates inflammatory responses to infection which contributes to tissue damage and pathology [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our current findings demonstrate that alcohol enhances IFN-&#x003b1; mediated necroptotic death of lung macrophages in young <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007174.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This leads to tissue damage and mortality in young alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice.</p><p>To determine the clinical relevance of our mouse studies, we compared IFN-&#x003b1; levels in the culture supernatants of &#x003b3;-irradiated <italic>Mtb</italic>-cultured PBMCs from young and old alcoholic and non-alcoholic healthy LTBI+ individuals. We found that PBMCs from young alcoholic LTBI+ individuals produced significantly higher amounts of IFN-&#x003b1; after culture with &#x003b3;-irradiated <italic>Mtb</italic> than those from young non-alcoholic, old alcoholic and old non-alcoholic healthy LTBI+ individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007174.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Our findings suggest that young alcoholic LTBI+ individuals have a higher risk of developing active TB infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that alcohol increases the mortality of young but not old mice infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>. The increased mortality of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice is due to IFN-&#x003b1; production by Ly6G+ cells. Further characterization of the exact phenotype of CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells and the delineation of the mechanisms through which alcohol enhances IFN-&#x003b1; production by Ly6G+ cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection will facilitate the development of therapies for alcoholic individuals with latent and active <italic>Mtb</italic>. Our findings may also be applicable to other intracellular pathogen infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal studies were performed with specific pathogen-free, 6- to 8- week -old and 17- to 22-month-old male and female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory and National Cancer Institute).
