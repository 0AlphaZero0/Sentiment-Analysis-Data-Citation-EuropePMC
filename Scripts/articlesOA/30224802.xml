The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) <italic>Mtb</italic> resistant to the frontline anti-tubercular drugs, rifampicin and isoniazid, forces treatment with toxic second-line drugs. Currently ~4% of new and ~21% of previously treated TB cases are either rifampicin drug resistant or MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> infections<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The specific molecular host-pathogen interactions mediating the rapid world-wide spread of MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strains remain poorly understood. W-Beijing <italic>Mtb</italic> strains are highly prevalent throughout the world and associated with increased drug resistance<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In the early 1990s, closely related MDR W-Beijing <italic>Mtb</italic> strains (strain W) were identified in large institutional outbreaks in New York City and caused high mortality rates<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Production of interleukin beta (IL-1&#x003b2; by macrophages coincides with the shift towards aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic process that mediates protection against drug susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic><sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Here, using a collection of MDR W-<italic>Mtb</italic> strains, we demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>Mtb</italic> cell wall lipids, phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) bypasses the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1R1) signaling pathway, instead driving the induction of interferon beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) to reprogram macrophage metabolism. Importantly, <italic>Mtb</italic> carrying a drug resistance conferring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <italic>rpoB</italic> (H445Y)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> can modulate host macrophage metabolic reprogramming. These findings transform our mechanistic understanding of how emerging MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strains may acquire drug resistance SNPs altering <italic>Mtb</italic> surface lipid expression and modulating host macrophage metabolic reprogramming.</p><p id="P4">The interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, IL-1R1<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> pathways are critical for host immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.

In contrast, <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, similar to <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Il10</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, controlled <italic>Mtb</italic> W_7642 infection (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Increased susceptibility in HN878-infected <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in exacerbated pulmonary inflammation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c-upper panel) and increased inflammatory myeloid cell accumulation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar increased <italic>Mtb</italic> burden in <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was observed upon infection with a W-Beijing <italic>Mtb</italic> pyrazinamide resistant strain, HN563 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). HN878 and W_7642 infection in B6 mice resulted in comparable pulmonary inflammation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) but showed differences in recruitment of myeloid cell populations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, W_7642-infected <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not exhibit exacerbated inflammation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c-lower panel), increased accumulation of inflammatory myeloid cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), or altered accumulation of activated IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) when compared with W_7642-infected B6 mice. Only a small increase in lung IL-6 protein levels in <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> W_7642-infected mice was observed when compared with B6 W_7642-infected mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Thus, while several key protective immune pathways function in both drug susceptible and MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, IL-1R1 signaling is critical for protection against drug susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic> infection but dispensable for immunity against an MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strain, W_7642.</p><p id="P5"><italic>Mtb</italic> infection of macrophages induces Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation, activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and a shift towards aerobic glycolysis to mediate <italic>Mtb</italic> control<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Accordingly, macrophages infected with HN878 or W_7642 induced transcriptional pathways associated with a shift to aerobic glycolysis, including key enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenases (<italic>Ldha</italic>, <italic>Ldhb</italic>), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (<italic>Pfkfb3</italic>) and aldolase A (<italic>Aldoa</italic>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Of interest, W_7642 infection shut down transcriptional networks associated with macrophage oxidative phosphorylation, including downregulation of NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 1 (<italic>Ndufa1</italic>) and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5 (<italic>Ndufb5</italic>), key components of the macrophage oxidative phosphorylation complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Importantly, W_7642 infection induced a distinct type I IFN transcriptional signature, including <italic>Ifnb1</italic>, and IFN-induced genes such as MX dynamin-like GTPase 2 (<italic>Mx2</italic>), interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (<italic>Ifit</italic>) 1, 2 and 3, as well as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (<italic>Stat1</italic>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). <italic>Ifna</italic> transcripts were not detected by RNA sequencing. Increased lung IFN-&#x003b2; levels were found in W_7642-infected mice when compared to HN878-infected mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). While induction of IL-1&#x003b1; mRNA and protein was similar, IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in W_7642-infection when compared to HN878-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>) and coincided with increased IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA and protein levels in W_7642-infection, when compared to HN878-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,e</xref>). These results were consistent at all time points measured and at varying multiplicity of infection (MOI, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a-c</xref>). The IL-1R1 pathway negatively regulated IFN-&#x003b2; in HN878 infection, but it did not regulate IFN-&#x003b2; production following W_7642 infection either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic>-mediated induction of IL-1&#x003b2; occurred in a <italic>Tlr2-</italic>, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (<italic>Asc</italic>)-, and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (<italic>Nlrp3</italic>)-dependent manner upon infection with either HN878 or W_7642 in myeloid cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). W_7642 mediated induction of IFN-&#x003b2; was dependent on cyclic GMP/AMP synthase (<italic>cGAS</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and minimally on TLR2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b,c</xref>). In contrast, mRNA and protein levels of TNF-&#x003b1; were comparable in HN878- and W_7642-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). When macrophages use aerobic glycolysis to generate energy, lactate is secreted as a by-product<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. W_7642 infection induced significantly lower accumulation of lactate than HN878 infection in macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Nitrite levels used as a measure of macrophage activation were not significantly different between HN878- and W_7642-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). In HN878 infection, lactate accumulation, macrophage activation and <italic>Mtb</italic> control was partly dependent on IL-1R1 signaling pathway while IL-1R1 signaling was dispensable for activation of macrophages and <italic>Mtb</italic> control in W_7642-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-g</xref>). Blocking IFNAR did not impact IL-1&#x003b2; production in B6 HN878-infected macrophages, but it resulted in increased IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate production in B6 W_7642-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). IFNAR blockade during W_7642 infection significantly reduced IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate production in <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages compared to B6 macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). While IFNAR blockade in HN878-infected <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages decreased <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU, IFNAR blockade in W_7642-infected <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages increased <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). Co-infection of W_7642 and HN878 strains in macrophages (even at 3 HN878:1 W_7642 ratio) decreased IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate production and increased IFN-&#x003b2; levels compared to HN878 infection alone (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; levels remained unchanged in single and co-infected macrophages (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, the presence of W_7642 can limit HN878-induced IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate accumulation in macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages treated with heat killed (hk) W_7642, or with hkHN878 and hkW_7642 together, also decreased IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate and increased IFN-&#x003b2; levels, when compared to hkHN878 treatment alone (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Thus, while <italic>Mtb</italic> replication is not required, an MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> cellular component limited IL-1&#x003b2; and aerobic glycolysis, while inducing IFN-&#x003b2; in macrophages. Using extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as an indicator of glycolysis<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, hkHN878 treatment induced significant ECAR in macrophages where this response was partly IL-1R1 dependent (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). However, hkW_7642 treatment, or co-treatment with hkHN878 and hkW_7642 induced significantly lower ECAR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Additionally, HN878 infection induced lower IL-1&#x003b2; levels and negligible levels of lactate in glucose-deprived galactose-containing medium in comparison to infection in glucose-containing medium (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). In contrast, culturing W_7642 infected macrophages in galactose-containing medium minimally impacted IL-1&#x003b2; or intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k,l</xref>). Low IFN-&#x003b2; levels were induced in HN878-infected macrophages grown either in glucose- or galactose-containing media, when compared to significantly higher IFN-&#x003b2; production in W_7642-infected macrophages grown in glucose-containing media (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). Thus, HN878 infection induced aerobic glycolysis to activate macrophage to mediate <italic>Mtb</italic> control, partly through the IL-1R1 pathway. In contrast, W_7642 is a poor inducer of IL-1&#x003b2;, instead inducing a potent IFN-&#x003b2; response and driving a less effective shift to aerobic glycolysis.</p><p id="P6">To delineate the specific molecular mechanism by which W_7642 activates macrophages, we used a collection of genetically conserved W-<italic>Mtb</italic> strains (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) that vary by a small number of SNPs by whole genome sequencing (WGS) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Of interest, W_7642 has two non-synonymous SNPs (H445Y and G563A) within the <italic>Mtb rpoB</italic>, which encodes the beta subunit of <italic>Mtb</italic> RNA polymerase<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. A closely related MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strain, W12_1811, encodes a mutation within <italic>rpoB</italic> at a distinct site (S450L). Infection of <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice with W12_1811 resulted in increased lung <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU, pulmonary inflammation, and myeloid cell accumulation when compared to B6 mice infected with W12_1811 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>). Additionally, W12_1811 infection in macrophages induced higher IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate production, and lower IFN-&#x003b2; levels when compared to W_7642-infected macrophages (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>).

Importantly, infection of macrophages with independent clones of HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y mutants, but not HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L mutants, recapitulated effects of W_7642 infection, with lower production of IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate and increased induction of IFN-&#x003b2;, when compared to HN878 treatment and at varying MOIs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>).

Additionally, HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L but not HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y infection of macrophages induced robust IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate accumulation in glucose-containing medium but not very effectively in galactose-containing medium, suggesting that IL-1&#x003b2; induction is glucose dependent<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>).

Thus, the <italic>rpoB-</italic>H445Y SNP in W_7642 may alter the composition of cell wall lipids, and impact host sensing of <italic>Mtb</italic> for reprogramming of macrophage metabolism. To address this, we identified PDIM changes in cell wall lipids between HN878 and the MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strain W_7642. Cell wall lipids were purified from similar bacterial numbers, and an internal triacylglycerol (TAG) standard was used to obtain relative quantification of lipids between the different strains. W_7642 showed increased relative abundance of long-chain multimethyl-branched fatty acid PDIMs in cell wall lipid preparations (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>-structural characterization of PDIM subclasses, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11a,b</xref>-PDIM spectra), when compared to the lower content of cell wall-associated PDIMs in HN878 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11a,b</xref>). Notably, as before<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, when normalized to TAG, HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y <italic>Mtb</italic> recapitulated the presence of abundant long-chain multimethyl-branched fatty acid PDIMs in cell wall lipid preparations (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f,g</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11c,d</xref>), when compared to the PDIMs in HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f,g</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11c,d</xref>). Importantly, while the W12_1811 <italic>Mtb</italic> strain also expressed more short-chain fatty acid PDIMs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12a,b</xref>) in comparison to the long-chain fatty acid PDIMs present in cell wall lipid preparations from <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y containing MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strains W12&#x02013;15183 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12c</xref>), W12&#x02013;3474 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12d</xref>), and W_7642 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12e</xref>). This coincided with increased expression of enzymes involved in PDIM synthesis such as phenolpthiocerol synthesis type-I polyketide synthase (<italic>ppsA</italic>, <italic>ppsB</italic> and <italic>ppsC</italic>) in W_7642 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11e</xref>). Both HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y and <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L had increased mRNA expression of these enzymes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11f</xref>). Thus, different <italic>rpoB</italic> SNPs may upregulate PDIM biosynthetic pathways. To test the physiological effects of the PDIMs on macrophage metabolic responses, <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages were exposed to HN878-derived PDIM coated polystyrene beads and resulted in reduced IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate production, and increased IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). Furthermore, while <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages exposed to W_7642-derived PDIM coated beads also suppressed IL-1&#x003b2; and lactate production and induced IFN-&#x003b2;, these changes were significantly pronounced and at lower PDIM coated bead doses when compared to effects of HN878-derived PDIM coated beads (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11g</xref>). Similar to the W_7642-derived PDIM coated bead exposure, the PDIM-mediated metabolic rewiring also occurred more robustly and at lower doses when <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages were treated with HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y-derived PDIM coated beads, when compared with HN878 <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L-derived PDIM coated beads (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11g</xref>). PDIM-coated beads alone did not impact cytokine or metabolic changes in uninfected macrophages (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). Thus, while the abundance of PDIMs may directly induce IFN-&#x003b2; and limit IL-1&#x003b2; production and shift to aerobic glycolysis, PDIMs composition may likely also contribute towards reprogramming macrophage metabolism during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and needs to be further tested.</p><p id="P10">Our limited knowledge of the immune parameters that mediate protection or drive disease progression during MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> infections is a significant hurdle to the current efforts to prevent world-wide emergence of MDR <italic>Mtb</italic>. We show here that <italic>Mtb</italic> carrying the widely prevalent <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y SNP<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, can alter macrophage metabolism through the induction of IFN-&#x003b2; and bypass the requirement for IL-1R1 pathway signaling for protective immunity. While we did not carry out WGS on the independent <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y mutants, it is unlikely that the same type of secondary mutations would occur in each independent clone studied. Drug resistant <italic>Mtb</italic> strains with the <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y and <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L SNPs are both associated with overexpression of PDIMs<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, treatment with long-chain fatty acid PDIMs from <italic>rpoB</italic>-H445Y more stringently inhibited glycolysis and induced IFN-&#x003b2; in macrophages when compared to short-chain PDIMs from <italic>rpoB</italic>-S450L, suggesting that both abundance of PDIMs and composition of PDIMs may impact macrophage metabolic rewiring. The S450L SNP did not exhibit major structural changes in the rifampicin binding site, while the H445Y SNP mediated structural changes in the binding site of <italic>Mtb</italic> RNA polymerase, thus preventing any binding of rifampicin<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. It is possible that these differential structural changes in RNA polymerase may regulate the differential expression of <italic>Mtb</italic> cell wall lipids including composition of PDIMs, as well other lipids<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, and needs to be fully explored in future studies. PDIM presence has been associated with decreased phagosomal acidification, phagosomal permeabilization<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and also increased <italic>Mtb</italic> escape from the intracellular vacuole into the cytosol<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, where it may mediate increased sensing by the cytosolic DNA sensor, cGAS and induction of IFN-&#x003b2;. A protective role for IL-1R1 signaling in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is well known<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, likely through the induction of the lipid mediator prostaglandin E2<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and involvement in aerobic glycolysis within macrophages<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Type I IFN transcriptional signature is associated with pulmonary TB disease<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and considered detrimental to immunity against drug susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic><sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. However, our results demonstrate that the IL-1R1 pathway is preferentially activated in drug susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, while MDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strains preferentially induce IFN-&#x003b2; that limits IL-1&#x003b2; induction, driving less effective aerobic glycolysis. Accordingly, even in pulmonary infection in mice, while both MDR and drug susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic> strains seemingly infect and induce TB disease, these infections recruit different inflammatory myeloid cells. Thus, the host immune metabolism induced in response to infection with drug resistant <italic>Mtb</italic> may be substantially different from responses induced upon infection with drug susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic> in hosts and need to more thoroughly studied. The implications of our findings are wide, as drug resistance in bacteria such as Staphlyococcus<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, Klebsiella<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and Enterococci<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> can induce cell surface lipid changes.

Thus, our study emphasizes that fully understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host immunity of drug resistant <italic>Mtb</italic> is critical for successful efforts to design new therapeutic targets and vaccines to prevent the spread of emerging MDR, as well as extensively and extremely drug resistant <italic>Mtb</italic> spread.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Mice</title><p id="P11">C57BL/6 (B6), <italic>Myd88</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>, <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>, <italic>Nos2</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>, Il10</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
