The mechanisms underpinning this important phenomenon are however, poorly elucidated, though known to rely on control of T effector cells (Teff) by regulatory T cells (Treg). Our studies show that circulating natural Treg cells in adults with PTB preserve their suppressive potential but Teff cells from such subjects are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression. We found this to be due to expansion of an activated Teff subset identified by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR expression. Sensitivity to suppression was restored to control levels by depletion of this subset. Comparative transcriptome analysis of Teff cells that contain HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells versus the fraction depleted of this population identified putative resistance mechanisms linked to <italic>IFNG</italic>, <italic>IL17A</italic>, <italic>IL22</italic>, <italic>PD-L1</italic> and &#x003b2;-chemokines <italic>CCL3L3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic> expression. Antibody blocking experiments confirmed HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff cells, but not the fraction depleted of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> effectors, to be resistant to Treg suppression mediated via CCR5 and PD-L1 associated pathways. In the presence of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff cells, activation of NF&#x003ba;B downstream of CCR5 and PD-L1 was perturbed. In addition, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff cells expressed significantly higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines that may regulate Treg function through a reciprocal counter-balancing relationship. Taken together, our study provides novel insight on how activated HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may contribute to disease associated inflammation by compromising Treg-mediated suppression in PTB.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>An important marker of progression to PTB following <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb)</italic> infection in humans is elevated frequencies of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, reflecting chronic T cell activation. However, the mechanisms by which activated HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to disease process is not known. We show that CD25<sup>-</sup> HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> memory Teff from PTB patients are resistant to suppression mediated by Treg cells. An unbiased transcriptome analysis identified several key pathways that contribute to this resistance. Specifically, presence of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells renders the effector population resistant to CCR5 and PD-L1 mediated suppression by Treg cells. In addition, the HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> memory Teff cells express elevated levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines known to counter-regulate and dampen Treg suppression.

In 2016, 1.3 million human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative (-ve) and 374,000 HIV positive (+ve) people succumbed to TB [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The spread of TB and mortality associated with it has been aggravated by the alarming rise in multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) cases. Control of TB is further challenged by the availability of just one preventive vaccine, BCG, which when given at birth confers good protection in children but does not efficiently prevent new infection and reactivation of latent TB in adults [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. India has the highest burden of TB and MDR TB globally. In 2016, about 2.8 million people were afflicted with TB in India, of which about 0.43 million died [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These statistics call for a better understanding of disease processes in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb)</italic> infection.</p><p>The functionally heterogeneous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment in the body is known to be important for immunity to TB [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, induced by HIV infection, is recognised to increase susceptibility to TB and TB incidence globally [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment, Th1 effector cytokines IFN&#x003b3; and IL-12 are particularly important. Humans with mutations in genes encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors and transcription factors involved in the Th1 pathway, e.g. <italic>IL12P40</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>IL12R</italic>, are highly susceptible to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and cannot even tolerate vaccination with attenuated BCG [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Maintaining an efficacious anti-TB Th1 T effector (Teff) response is dependent on counter-regulation by an additional subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, termed natural regulatory T cells (Treg). Treg cells are commonly identified by constitutive expression of CD25 (IL-2 receptor), FoxP3 (transcription factor) and reduced expression of CD127 (IL-7 receptor) and are responsible for suppressing Teff cell proliferation and cytokine expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This negative control of Teff by Treg cells is critical for immune homeostasis. Increasing evidence shows that Treg/Teff cell balance might be disrupted in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Studies in mice show that pathogen specific Treg cells expand early in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and play a role in delaying the generation of IFN&#x003b3; producing CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Depletion of Treg cells from <italic>in vitro</italic> human cultures increases IFN&#x003b3; secretion in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen stimulation [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These data indicate that Tregs may dampen protective responses and thereby hinder pathogen clearance <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the role of Treg cells in the chronic phase of TB is less clear, especially in humans. Several studies show that Tregs expand in chronic infection and may be a possible marker of disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, other studies do not report such an expansion [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. More recent studies highlight a potentially important role for Treg cells in controlling TB associated inflammation. Cellular and molecular markers of immune activation are elevated in subjects with TB [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or HIV-TB co-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and human and animal models highlight control of such inflammation to be potentially protective [reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, increase in Treg frequency within granulomas of <italic>Mtb</italic> infected non-human primates, is interpreted as a homeostatic response to concomitant increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cell numbers [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. DBA/2 mice, which are highly susceptible to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, fail to recruit sufficient FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to the lung and exhibit excessive <italic>Mtb</italic> induced inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whilst IL-2 induced expansion of Tregs confers protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the role of Treg cells requires not only measuring Treg frequencies, but also probing their functional characteristics. Treg mediated homeostasis is equally dependent on the potency of Treg cells to suppress Teff proliferation and cytokine expression as well as the susceptibility of Teff cells to Treg suppression. A dampened ability of Treg cells to suppress, as in many autoimmune disorders [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or altered sensitivity of Teff cells to Treg-mediated suppression, as in HIV and Type I diabetes [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], would equally disrupt T cell homeostasis. These functional characteristics of Treg-mediated immune homeostasis are poorly elucidated in TB and underpin this study. We hypothesized that maintenance of Treg-mediated homeostasis is probably disrupted in the chronic phase of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and this may contribute to disease by promoting immune activation through an exaggerated Teff cell response. Our study systematically probed the quality of Treg-mediated suppression in adult PTB. We found that Treg frequency and suppressive potential are preserved in PTB. However, peripheral expansion of a subset of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells identified by HLA-DR expression compromises Treg mediated control in PTB subjects. Generalised immune activation [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and expansion of activated T cells identified by high HLA-DR expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are well-recognised markers of TB, but, precisely how the presence of activated T cells counteracts Treg function has not been elucidated. We found that HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff from PTB subjects are resistant to suppression by Treg cells. RNA-Sequence analysis of Teff that contain HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells versus the fraction depleted of this subset identified putative resistance pathways. Blocking studies show HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff are compromised to Treg-mediated suppression mediated through the &#x003b2;-chemokine receptor CCR5 as well as through the negative regulatory molecule, PD-L1. Both CCR5 and PD-L1 are reported to promote Treg suppression [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; here we show for the first time their role in Teff susceptibility to Treg suppression in TB.

However, depletion of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells significantly improved suppression and restored it to levels comparable to that seen in IGRA-ve healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

Appropriate 5 &#x003bc;g/ml isotype antibody was used as control in both cases and cells were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads (beads:cell ratio of 1:1).

To understand the importance of these pathways in Treg-mediated suppression in our system of study, we first measured expression of CCR5, the key receptor for beta chemokines: CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, on PTB total and HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff at baseline and after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). CCR5 expression as measured by median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was similar on both subsets after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Next, we investigated the effect of CCR5 blockade on Treg mediated suppression in activated PTB total and HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Presence of anti-CCR5 antibody in an autologous suppression assay did not significantly alter the low level of suppression of PTB total Teff cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). However, blockade of CCR5 in a suppression assay with PTB HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells significantly reduced Treg mediated suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8D</xref>) suggesting that: (a) the CCR5 pathway is important for suppression in PTB HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells, and (b) the presence of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells interferes with suppression mediated by this pathway, thereby contributing to the observed disparity in Treg mediated suppression of PTB total and HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells.</p><p>The functional significance of CD274 (PD-L1) was next tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8E&#x02013;8G</xref>).

Further, blockade of the PD-1-PD-L1 interaction leads to inhibition of Treg function in cells harvested from PTB individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These data are consistent with the importance of this pathway in both Teff and Treg function and therefore Treg-mediated homeostasis.</p><p>Although mRNA measurement showed PDL-1 to be marginally, but significantly higher on PTB HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> compared to PTB total Teff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8E</xref>), cell surface staining showed similar expression at baseline and following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). However, the MFI of PD-L1 on PTB HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells was marginally higher (median MFI = 346, range = 123&#x02013;461), compared to median MFI of PTB total Teff cells (median MFI = 278, range = 134&#x02013;437) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8F</xref>) but there was no significant difference. Blocking with anti-PD-L1 was next carried out to test functional significance of PD-L1 expression. Blocking PD-L1 in autologous Treg suppression assays significantly diminished suppression of PTB HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g008">Fig 8G</xref>) suggesting that enhanced suppression observed in HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells is partly mediated through PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. The reduction in percentage suppression in case of HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells upon blockade of PD-L1 was consistent across all donors tested and more marked than blocking the CCR5 pathway. Anti-PD-L1 decreased Treg suppression by 83% compared to a 43% drop in suppression of the same cells by anti-CCR5.</p><p>To assess if resistance of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff to CCR5 and PDL-1-mediated suppression was specific to PTB, we analyzed the effect of blocking these pathways on suppression of Teff containing HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells and the fraction depleted of this subset (HLA-DR<sup>-</sup>) from IGRA-ve controls. We predicted both these pathways to be operative based on data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, which showed that Teffs from IGRA- ve controls contain a very small percentage of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells and depletion of these cells did not affect Treg mediated suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007289.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

Novel aspects of the study are (a) loss of Treg-mediated function in TB is due to Teff cells becoming resistant to Treg mediated suppression rather than inability of Treg cells to suppress Teff cells or a drop in circulating Treg cell frequency (b) this resistance is due to expansion of a small population of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells as depletion of this fraction restores suppression to control levels, and (c) that a combination of mechanisms accounts for the resistance of total HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff cells to suppression by Treg cells, which includes expression of high levels of IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17A and IL-22, known to counter-regulate Treg cell function [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Additionally, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells possibly interfere with PD-L1 and CCR5 mediated Treg-suppression, as depleting the HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> fraction restores sensitivity of Teff cells to suppression via these pathways.</p><p>Tregs possibly play opposing roles in TB. A detrimental role, early post infection, is based on murine models showing an inappropriate accumulation of pathogen specific thymus derived Tregs following transportation of <italic>Mtb</italic> to the pulmonary lymph node after aerosol exposure, which inhibits and thereby delays induction of a protective T cell response resulting in higher bacterial burden [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. On the other hand, a potentially protective role for Treg cells in the chronic phase, linked to suppression of inflammation, is based on both murine and macaque models. Absence of Tregs in lungs of infected mice can lead to uncontrolled inflammation and mortality [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, depletion of Tregs from infected mice does not decrease pathogen load [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]; rather their expansion with IL-2 therapy provides resistance to TB in infected macaques [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our data is consistent with a potentially beneficial role for Treg-mediated regulation in the chronic phase of TB by limiting the damaging effects of chronic T cell activation.</p><p>Variable changes in circulating Treg frequencies have been reported across different TB cohorts [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We also found a wide range of Treg frequency in PTB with no significant difference compared to controls. This inherent diversity in circulating Treg frequencies may reflect the efficiency by which Tregs traffic and home to the site of infection in the lung, where Treg cells have been previously noted. Studies in humans found that Tregs expand more strongly at local sites of infection than systemically [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Beyond measure of frequency, several studies show that Treg cells isolated from human subjects with PTB preserve their suppressive potential [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We confirm this to be the case, but additionally highlight that despite maintaining suppressive potential, Treg-mediated function is compromised in PTB subjects due to Teff cell resistance to Treg suppression. Whilst such resistance has not been reported in PTB, it is consistent with data from autoimmune conditions where activated T cells contribute to pathology and become resistant to Treg mediated suppression [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Consistent with our data, deleterious T cell activation in TB has been linked to expansion of a minor subset (median frequency = 9.5%, Range = 4.12&#x02013;40%) of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> and or CD38<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Importantly, elevated frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells have been identified to be a potential predictive marker of active TB risk in both BCG vaccinated infants and <italic>Mtb</italic> infected adolescents [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The precise mechanisms underpinning how CD4<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> T cells might contribute to TB disease have not been elucidated. We demonstrate for the first time through depletion studies that it is the small fraction of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>, rather than CD38<sup>+</sup> or PD-1<sup>+</sup> Teff cells, that impairs Treg-mediated homeostatic control and we used differential transcriptome analysis of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> total Teff &#x02018;vs&#x02019; effectors depleted of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells to identify genes that contribute to this observation. One key mechanism is through significantly elevated expression of key Th1 effector cytokine, IFN&#x003b3;, and Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-22. Th17 cells though important in immunity to infection also contribute to damaging inflammation, if uncontrolled [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and can be pathological when co-expressed with IL-17 and IFN&#x003b3; [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Importantly, Th17 and Treg subsets are counter-regulatory. The function of Treg cells is recognised to be influenced by IFN&#x003b3; [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and their generation is reciprocally regulated along with Th17 differentiation by IL-6 and TGF&#x003b2; [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Indeed, a high Th17/Treg ratio is linked to disease in rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The Th17/Treg ratio has also been reported to be altered in subjects with TB relative to healthy controls [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Our data provides mechanistic insight by identifying elevated Th17 cytokine expression by HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff as a potential mechanism for their resistance to Treg-mediated suppression.</p><p>Our RNA-Sequence data combined with blocking studies highlight that HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells can additionally impair Treg-mediated regulation through CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways. A role for CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and their receptor CCR5 in Treg mediated suppression has been previously reported in autoimmunity and cancer [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and we demonstrate through blockade experiments both these pathways to be of fundamental importance in cells from IGRA-ve controls. Expression of beta-chemokines by Tregs and CCR5 on Teff promotes suppression through migration of Treg cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. CCR5 can also function as a T cell co-stimulator [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In addition, CCR5 signaling has been implicated in the resolution of inflammatory responses through IL-10 expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. On the other hand, PD-L1, a ligand for a negative co-stimulatory receptor PD-1, is expressed on antigen presenting cells as well as on activated T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. PD-1-PD-L1 interaction inhibits T cell activation and several effector T cell responses and helps in maintaining immune tolerance [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In addition, PD-1-PD-L1 interactions have been reported to increase Treg generation and function by enhancing FoxP3 and sustaining its expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Elevated frequency of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been reported in PTB subjects [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] with blocking studies highlighting this pathway to be functional [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We found that HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff resistance to Treg suppression mediated through the CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways is not due to absence of CCR5 or PD-L1. Instead, our data demonstrate that NFkB signalling via both CCR5 and PD-L1 ligation on PTB Teff cells is selectively impaired in HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reflected by antibody mediated blockade of these pathways rescuing Treg-mediated suppression in the fraction of Teff cells depleted of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells but not the Teff fraction containing HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells from PTB subjects. Comparative analysis with Teff from IGRA-ve controls, highlights fundamental functional differences between HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> Teff cells from PTB &#x02018;vs&#x02019; IGRA-ve subjects as the CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways remained functional in the fraction of Teff containing HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from IGRA-ve but not PTB subjects. One mechanism for this functional difference may be related to lower expression of counter-regulatory cytokines (IFN&#x003b3;, IL-22 and IL-17A) by IGRA-ve compared to PTB HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells reflected also by significantly lower overall frequencies of memory HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells in IGRA-ve &#x02018;vs&#x02019; PTB. These data raise the important possibility that activated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells identified by HLA-DR expression may be inherently functionally different across different disease states, which is a testable hypothesis and subject of future investigation.</p><p>Beyond the above tested pathways, our RNA-sequence data highlights that Teff cells comprising the HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> fraction express higher levels of markers of inflammation and T activation (<italic>CSF2</italic>, <italic>FASLG</italic>, <italic>TRAF1</italic> and <italic>TRAF3</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. On the other hand, HLA-DR<sup>-</sup> Teff cells, apart from <italic>PD-L1</italic>, <italic>CCL3L3</italic> and <italic>CCL4</italic>, had elevated expression of complement receptor <italic>CD46</italic> and <italic>TRAIL</italic>.

TRAIL promotes Treg proliferation and inhibits Th1 responses, consequently suppressing autoimmunity [<xref rid="ppat.1007289.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].
