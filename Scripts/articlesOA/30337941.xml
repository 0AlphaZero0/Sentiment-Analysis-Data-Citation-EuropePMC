To date, confirmatory high confidence expression profiling signatures for clinical use remain uncertain. Here we have sought to evaluate the reproducibility and confirmatory nature of differential expression signatures, comprising molecular and cellular pathways, across multiple international clinical observational studies investigating children and adult whole blood transcriptome responses to tuberculosis (TB).</p><p><bold>Methods and findings:</bold> A systematic search and quality control assessment of gene expression repositories for human TB using whole blood resulted in 11 datasets with a total of 1073 patients from Africa, Europe, and South America. A non-parametric estimation of percentage of false prediction was used for meta-analysis of high confidence differential expression analysis. Deconvolution analysis was applied to infer changes in immune cell proportions and enrichment tests applied using pathway database resources. Meta-analysis identified high confidence differentially expressed genes, comprising 372 in adult active-TB versus latent-TB (LTBI), 332 in adult active-TB versus controls (CON), five in LTBI versus CON, and 415 in childhood active-TB versus LTBI. Notably, these confirmatory markers have low representation in published signatures for diagnosing TB. Pathway biology analysis of high confidence gene sets revealed dominant metabolic and innate-immune pathway signatures while suppressed signatures were enriched with adaptive signaling pathways and reduced proportions of T and B cells. Childhood TB showed uniquely strong inflammasome antagonist signature (<italic>IL1RN</italic> and <italic>ILR2</italic>), while adult TB patients exhibit a significant preponderance type I and type II IFN markers. Key limitations of the study include the paucity of data on potential confounders.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Meta-analysis identified high confidence confirmatory immune-metabolic and cellular expression signatures across studies regardless of the population resource setting, HIV status and circulating endemic pathogens. Notably, previously identified diagnostic signature markers for TB show limited concordance with the confirmatory meta-analysis. Overall, our results support the use of the confirmatory expression signatures for guiding optimized diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring modalities in TB.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>systemic responses</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis caused by members of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality due to an infectious agent despite the availability of potent antimycobacterials (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2015</xref>). About a third of the world population is latently infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with a life time risk of re-activation to cause active TB and transmission to other susceptible hosts. BCG, the only licensed TB vaccine has variable efficacy ranging from 0&#x02013;80% with limited efficacy in preventing pulmonary TB in adults who are largely responsible for disease transmission (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Colditz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Karonga Prevention Trial Group, 1996</xref>). The control of TB is further complicated due to the emergence of antimycobacterial resistance and co-infection with HIV, with TB as the leading cause of death in HIV co-infected patients (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bruchfeld et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the host immune response to mycobacterial infection although thought to be primarily T cell mediated is very complex and remains incompletely understood (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dwivedi et al., 2012</xref>) and there are currently no validated immune correlates of protection.</p><p>To develop the more efficacious vaccines identified as essential for global TB control, it is important to understand the host immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> A promising approach to interrogate the host response at a systemic level in order to identify correlates of protection is systemic analyses of host transcriptional responses, using methods such as microarrays and increasingly RNA sequencing.</p><p>Several published studies have used genome-wide transcriptomics to investigate the host systemic response to TB, pathway biology and to identify diagnostic signatures to distinguish active TB from LTBI, uninfected controls, and other diseases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaforou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Tientcheu et al., 2015</xref>). These studies were conducted in different geographical regions, and HIV infection status. Previous studies have reported that a comparison of independently identified differentially expressed genes and diagnostic signatures revealed that less that 80% of differentially regulated genes and only about 60% of interferon (IFN) gamma signature genes were consistently found in all studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2011a</xref>). In analyzing whole blood transcriptomics, it is critical to account for cellular heterogeneity yet an investigation of cellular proportions and pathways by applying cell-specific deconvolution algorithms remains lacking for current TB expression profiling studies. Moreover, independent TB transcriptomics studies conducted for adults and children can be further complicated by the different clinical manifestations, prior history of infection, and for these reasons maybe anticipated to have different systemic gene expression signatures. In this connection, it is worth noting that a comparison between adult and childhood TB expression profiles has not been reported. Moreover, given the wide age range, population, and cellular heterogeneity of these large data-rich studies, it is not too surprising that the clinical usefulness of expression signatures remains uncertain.</p><p>Meta-analyses can provide a statistically stringent and powerful approach to integrate and computationally deconvolute large independent datasets and thereby infer with high confidence new and consistently differentially expressed genes and pathways across multiple studies and age groups. Very recently, several studies have conducted a meta-analysis of a subset of publicly available TB transcriptomic studies; however, none of these meta-analyses studies involved a complete and comprehensive range of both adult and childhood TB (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sambarey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) Most notably, the primary data in these studies have yet to be used to identify sentinel immune-metabolic pathways and to deconvolute the proportions of different immune cell types during TB and which are critical in understanding more completely the host systemic responses and for accounting the contribution of specific immune cell type pathways to disease pathogenesis.</p><p>In the present investigation, we evaluate the primary hypothesis that a common pathogenic predictive pathway biology response (inclusive of cellular, molecular, and metabolic determinants) underpins TB across different ages and populations. Accordingly, this raises a key question of delineating high confidence qualitative and quantitative pathway biology differences between childhood and adult TB. To address the central hypothesis and question, we used meta-analysis for integrating data from heterogeneous populations, to identify high confidence differentially and similarly expressed marker genes in children and adults, with active and latent TB across multiple international observational case control studies, irrespective of HIV status, geographical location, and circulating endemic pathogens. Furthermore, we performed gene expression deconvolution to determine which cell types constituted the highest proportions in TB patients and are possible contributors to disease pathologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Data Acquisition</title><p>Gene expression data repositories (GEO and ArrayExpress) were searched for datasets on human response to TB in English for meta-analysis with the following criteria: (I) Search term; {(human TB whole blood) AND &#x0201c;Homo sapiens&#x0201d;[porgn:__txid9606]} was used to retrieve datasets relating to TB gene expression. (II) Each study should be conducted using whole blood not peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as PBMCs when correctly purified have little granulocytes which have been shown to contribute to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et al., 2012</xref>). (III) The study should include active TB and one of either latently infected individuals (LTBI) or uninfected controls. (IV) Studies conducted using custom arrays or using qPCR were excluded because such array does not contain all genes in the genome and could be biased for specific cell types. Furthermore, following database searches publications associated with selected datasets were read to confirm clinical definitions and whether patients were treated prior to blood collection for microarray. Where datasets were not accessible or raw datasets were not available, authors were contacted for raw datasets, but further data were not made available. All searches were done on publicly available data repositories; no unpublished abstracts and studies were considered. A second assessor role (TF and PD) refereed issues arising from primary data and for workflow accuracy with any discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus with BK and PG. A detailed workflow of data acquisition, curation, and analysis can be found in <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref></bold>. As defined by the original studies, whole blood for transcriptome studies was collected before initiation of treatment and in one study before or within 24 h of initiation of treatment (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaforou et al., 2013</xref>). All searches were done on or before May 2016. While reporting guidelines have yet to be standardized for meta-analysis of gene expression, we adhered as close as possible to guidelines for the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE, <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Quality Control, Filtering, and Summarization</title><p>The arrayQualityMetrics package in bioconductor (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kauffmann et al., 2009</xref>) was used to assess the quality of each dataset in the R statistical environment. After quality control, each dataset was independently normalized before differential expression analysis. Datasets were generated using different array platforms (Illumina, Affymetrix, or Agilent), which have different probe identifiers (IDs) representing different genes on the array chip. Therefore, probes were summarized to Entrez gene levels by selecting probes with the largest median across the samples regardless of clinical phenotype to represent a specific gene. Genes present in at least two datasets were selected for inclusion in meta-analyses to account for as many genes as possible across different array platforms. Prior to extensive statistical analysis, an exploratory analysis of pairwise correlations between fold changes of the datasets was used to identity outlier datasets that could bias the meta-analysis. Only datasets with good pairwise correlations to other datasets were selected for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential Expression Statistical Analysis</title><p>To determine genes differentially expressed in active TB, dataset specific and meta-analysis approaches were performed using the RankProd package in the R statistical environment for estimation of percentage of false prediction (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2011</xref>). Meta-analyses for adult and childhood TB were conducted separately. For each individual study, three pairwise contrasts were made where possible; these were active TB versus LTBI, active TB versus uninfected controls, and LTBI versus uninfected controls. Second, the same comparisons were made in a rank product meta-analysis, resulting in an overall estimate of gene expression fold changes and statistical significance across all studies under consideration. The childhood studies lacked uninfected controls in the original studies; therefore, contrasts were performed with LTBI alone and assume that LTBI exhibits a less immune stimulatory status. Differentially expressed genes (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05, absolute fold change 1.5) obtained from the meta-analysis and from the individual study analysis were compared to identify with high confidence differentially expressed genes for downstream systemic pathway biology analysis. Given the fundamental differences between manifestations of TB in adults and children (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alca&#x000ef;s et al., 2005</xref>), differentially expressed genes obtained from adult and childhood TB were also compared to identify genes commonly differentially expressed in both and those uniquely expressed in either patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole Blood Cellular Deconvolution</title><p>The cellular components of whole blood can vary in different physiological states and during infections and illness and could influence results obtained from whole blood differential expression analysis. Accordingly, the CellMix package (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2013</xref>) was used to deconvolute the proportions of different immune cell types in active TB patients, latently infected individuals, and uninfected controls. The signatures used for the deconvolution are based on individual immune cell signatures identified based on cell specific gene expression analyses as previously described (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas et al., 2005</xref>). The normalized and log<sub>2</sub> transformed dataset was used for the deconvolution using <italic>gedBlood</italic> function in the <italic>CellMix</italic> package (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2013</xref>). Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to perform pairwise statistical analysis of cell proportions between different clinical phenotypes in each dataset. For each cell type, the median of the controls (either LTBI or uninfected controls) was subtracted from the active TB patients for graphical representation per dataset.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathway Analysis</title><p>The manually curated innate database (InnateDB; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dunkelberger and Song, 2010</xref>) was used for pathway analysis to interrogate biological pathways associated with differentially regulated genes in active TB. Up and downregulated genes were analyzed separately and for each, three separate analyses were made; genes differentially regulated (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 and fold change &#x0003e; 1.5) in both adult and childhood TB, those regulated only in adults, and those regulated only childhood TB. To generate graphical representations of significant pathways, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values were -log<sub>10</sub> transformed and plotted on the <italic>x</italic>-axis for each pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Data Curation, Quality Control, and Analysis Workflow</title><p>Twelve microarray datasets with total sample size of 1110 patients (consisting of active TB patients, LTBI, and uninfected controls) passed predefined criteria. Of the 12 datasets, nine were from adults (825 patients) and three datasets were obtained from children (285 subjects). The studies analyzed here include both HIV negative and HIV positive patients as defined per the original studies. <bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold> contains information about datasets included in this analysis and their respective GEO accession numbers. <bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold> also shows the geographical locations of sample collections sites, year the study was conducted, array platforms used for the microarray, and the age definition of the patients. Before extensive differential expression analysis, an exploratory analysis was done on the twelve datasets, as outlined in the analysis workflow in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold> (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref></bold>). In this exploratory analysis, the top 1000 most variable probes in the datasets were used to perform a hierarchical unsupervised clustering to determine if expression of these genes can cluster samples from different clinical phenotypes and identify outlier datasets. The clustering largely grouped active TB patients from LTBI and uninfected controls but there was no clear distinct clustering of latently infected individuals and uninfected controls as shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>. Pairwise correlations of the different datasets were done to identify outlier datasets. Dataset (GSE34608) was found not to be well correlated with the rest of the other datasets (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S2&#x02013;S4</xref></bold>) and was therefore removed from the differential expression analysis pipeline. Furthermore, after QC for each dataset, poor quality samples were removed. The number of samples removed for each dataset can be found in <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref></bold> and the outlier dataset also removed resulting in 11 datasets consisting of 1073 subjects taken forward for meta-analysis.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of datasets included in the

Therefore, to identify with high confidence genes that were reproducibly regulated across different datasets, differentially expressed genes from the meta-analysis were compared with genes from the individual dataset specific analyses. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold> shows heatmaps of the fold changes of significant genes (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05) obtained from the meta-analysis for each phenotypic comparison made and those obtained from independently analyzing each of the datasets. As expected from a meta-analysis, it can be seen that many genes with notable fold changes in individual studies lose this characteristic in meta-analysis (where the influence of individual studies is reduced by size-based weighting and in context of all studies), thereby reducing the count of false positive results and increasing the number of high confidence genes with differential expression. Only five genes were identified as high confidence in LTBI versus uninfected controls further highlighting the gene expression similarities between these two groups (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>). Active TB versus LTBI had 374 differentially expressed genes which were identified with high confidence while active TB versus uninfected controls had 332 genes. Active TB versus LTBI in children had more high confidence genes (415 genes) compared to adult TB (374 genes) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>).

These are CMPK2, FCGR1A, HSPA1B, LOC440607, CCL3L1, LOC649853, LOC653980, and CCL4L2. In summary, while the meta-analysis failed to identify many new differentially expressed compared to the individual studies analyses, a highly robust high confident set of expression signals was developed with small number of previously undisclosed markers. Most notably, meta-analysis significantly reduced the number of false positive results, eliminating genes with low reproducibility in differential expression across studies.

In summary, this suggests as expected that the lack of specific clustering of differentially expressed genes in either comparison is indicative of a less immune activated status in latent TB in comparison with active TB.

Importantly, <italic>HLA-G</italic> is known to play a critical role for suppressing maternal immunity in fetal development. <italic>IL1RN</italic> encodes an <italic>IL1</italic> receptor antagonist that inhibits <italic>IL1</italic> mediated signaling during the immune response and <italic>IL1R2</italic> is a decoy receptor which binds to IL1 alpha/beta inhibiting its activity with its ligand. <italic>CD40LG</italic> is a <italic>CD40</italic> ligand expressed on the surface of T cells and involved in the regulation of B cell function. <italic>HLA-DOB</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> are members of the major histocompatibility complex important for antigen processing and presentation. <italic>CD28</italic> is also expressed on the surface of T cells and important for T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and Th2 cell development. Overall this data indicate upregulation of inhibitory immune signaling molecules and downregulation of co-stimulatory signaling molecules important for immune signaling during active TB.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we used a systematic meta-analysis approach to comprehensively reanalyze publicly available microarray datasets to identify high confidence differentially regulated signatures in adult and childhood TB across multiple continents and a spectrum of circulating endemic pathogens and HIV infection status. Compared to the individual analyses of each dataset, the meta-analysis provided increased power to detect only a limited number of differentially regulated genes but most critically identified high confidence differentially regulated gene sets, reducing a large number of false positive markers detected in the individual study analyses. This demonstrated a small overlap of potential biomarkers across multiple studies conducted in different geographical locations, and which agrees with another very recently published meta-analysis of TB (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sambarey et al., 2017</xref>). In adults with active TB versus LTBI, 374 genes were differentially regulated and in active TB versus uninfected controls, 332 genes were differentially regulated. As observed in previous studies, the expression profiles of latently infected individuals and non-infected controls were very similar (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2011a</xref>) but critically identifying for the first time five significantly latent specific biomakers. When we compared genes regulated in active TB versus LTBI or active TB versus uninfected controls, there was a good overlap (216 genes). By contrast, 124 genes and 158 genes were only regulated in active TB versus uninfected controls and active TB versus LTBI, respectively. This therefore clearly indicates a much-reduced immune altered state in latent TB but which retains a minimal detectable systemic response. In relation to age, childhood TB developed a more differentially regulated genes (415) than to adult active TB versus LTBI of which approximately half (206) were also significant in adults, revealing a common core pathogenic network response as well as the anticipated differences in response to TB in adults and children that likely relate to the different clinical manifestations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alca&#x000ef;s et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of confirmatory differentially regulated genes with previously identified TB diagnostic signatures (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaforou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>) showed a low confirmatory rate (ranging from 14 to 64%) as shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>. While this could be possibly explained by the different fold change cut-off set used in the independent studies, the meta-analysis approach reduces false positives and therefore the low correspondence most probably reflects the underlying heterogeneity and overall poor reproducibility for those markers. This highlights the urgent need for potential diagnostic markers to be validated across different and larger patient sample size populations, and critically the standardization of statistical methods and significant cut-offs across studies.</p><p>Pathway analyses indicated that genes up and downregulated in both adult and childhood TB were enriched with innate and adaptive immune response pathways, respectively, suggesting strong upregulation of innate inflammatory immune responses and downregulation of adaptive responses, which corroborates previous findings (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2011a</xref>). Adults show more IFN driven innate immune pathways and downregulated adaptive pathways. On the other hand, childhood specific upregulated genes were associated with inflammasome IL1RN&#x02013;IL1R2 suppression axis, glucose transport, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> release, and cell surface interaction pathways while downregulated genes were associated with mRNA translation, protein metabolism, and amino acid transport. Indeed, recent studies have indicated that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> imports host amino acids and relies on them to thrive in the host (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gouzy et al., 2014</xref>). Most importantly, in childhood TB, the immune inhibitory molecules, <italic>IL1RN</italic> and <italic>IL1R2</italic> which inhibit functional <italic>IL1</italic> signaling and molecules involved in generation of an adaptive immune response (<italic>CD40LG</italic>, <italic>HAL-DOB</italic>, <italic>CD28</italic>) that were downregulated is consistent with emerging evidence linking the cross talk between <italic>IL1</italic> and type 1 IFN to TB and which provide potential targets for host directed therapy (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>). This could explain the observation that children have less pronounced adaptive immune responses to TB compared to adults, potentially resulting in disseminated forms of the diseases seen more frequently in childhood TB. Our findings further highlight the differences between adult and childhood TB and most critically a previously unrecognized potential of using the same common host signature for novel diagnostics in both adult and childhood TB.</p><p>Furthermore, whole blood deconvolution indicated high proportions of neutrophils in active TB compare to latently infected individuals and uninfected individuals which is reflective of observed pathway biology. This corroborates previous studies indicating the important role of neutrophils in TB, previously identified as major contributors to observed gene expression signatures (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martineau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Eum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mcnab et al., 2011</xref>). This meta-analysis which combined studies from different locations further strengthens evidence for the important contribution of neutrophils in TB. Proportions of monocytes and activated NK cells were also higher in active TB compared to controls, and NK cells have been shown to play an important role in combating mycobacterial infections (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chore&#x000f1;o Parra et al., 2017</xref>). However, proportions of resting NK cells were lower in active TB compared to LTBI individuals and uninfected controls which agrees with previous studies (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kee et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, proportions of T and B cells which make up the adaptive arm of the immune system were downregulated, which corroborated results observed in the pathway analysis. This is in line with recent studies showing that patients with active TB have reduced frequency of circulating B cell and T cell responses and higher in successfully TB treated individuals compared to patients recently diagnosed with TB (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Joosten et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By using meta-analysis to re-analyze publicly available microarray datasets, we identified with high confidence signature genes differentially expressed across studies removing a large number of false positive markers. Most importantly, from translational perspective, we reveal a previously unrecognized potential of using a common host immune-metabolic signature network as a novel diagnostical tool for use in both adult and childhood TB. We believe that the use of the confirmatory expression signatures identified here will help in guiding optimized diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring modalities for TB patients, but which will still necessitate high quality prospective randomized trials to assess clinical efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This was meta-analysis of already existing publicly available online dataset from gene expression data repositories.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SB and PG conceived and designed the study.
