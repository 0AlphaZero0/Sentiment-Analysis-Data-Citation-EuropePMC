Currently, diagnosis of active TB is hampered by the lack of specific biomarkers that discriminate active TB disease from other (lung) diseases or latent TB infection (LTBI). Integrated human gene expression results have shown that genes encoding complement components, in particular different C1q chains, were expressed at higher levels in active TB compared to LTBI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> C1q protein levels were determined using ELISA in sera from patients, from geographically distinct populations, with active TB, LTBI as well as disease controls.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Serum levels of C1q were increased in active TB compared to LTBI in four independent cohorts with an AUC of 0.77 [0.70; 0.83]. After 6 months of TB treatment, levels of C1q were similar to those of endemic controls, indicating an association with disease rather than individual genetic predisposition. Importantly, C1q levels in sera of TB patients were significantly higher as compared to patients with sarcoidosis or pneumonia, clinically important differential diagnoses. Moreover, exposure to other mycobacteria, such as <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (leprosy patients) or BCG (vaccinees) did not result in elevated levels of serum C1q. In agreement with the human data, in non-human primates challenged with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, increased serum C1q levels were detected in animals that developed progressive disease, not in those that controlled the infection.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In summary, C1q levels are elevated in patients with active TB compared to LTBI in four independent cohorts. Furthermore, C1q levels from patients with TB were also elevated compared to patients with sarcoidosis, leprosy and pneumonia. Additionally, also in NHP we observed increased C1q levels in animals with active progressive TB, both in serum and in broncho-alveolar lavage. Therefore, we propose that the addition of C1q to current biomarker panels may provide added value in the diagnosis of active TB.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>complement</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>C1q</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>blood</kwd><kwd>mycobacterium</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Horizon 2020<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100007601</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">643381</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">1R21AI127133-01</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">ZonMw<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001826</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">842002001</award-id><award-id rid="cn003">91712334</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="8683"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat, which is caused by infection by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.tb</italic>) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Current estimations indicate that a quarter of the global population is infected with <italic>M.tb</italic>, with a life-long risk to develop active TB disease. Particular regions, such as South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and Africa regions account for more than 80% of infected individuals (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Annually over 6 million people are diagnosed with TB disease, a serious and highly contagious condition, resulting in 1.3 million deaths in 2016 only (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). While most infected individuals remain asymptomatic latently infected (LTBI), a minority (5&#x02013;10%) of these individuals progress to active TB. Given the high rate of infections with <italic>M.tb</italic> in some regions it is important to discriminate infection from disease, which is difficult with the currently available tests. At present, only <italic>M.tb</italic> detection in sputum using smear, PCR or culture is definitive proof of TB disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of TB disease is important to reduce transmission of infection and prevent disease associated mortality (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Diagnosis of active TB is made by microbiological or genetic detection of <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputum (or other specimens in case of extrapulmonary TB), but this can be expensive and time-consuming depending on bacterial burdens or requires complex methodology and infrastructure. Current immunological tests can detect infection with <italic>M.tb</italic> but often fail to discriminate active disease from latent infection (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can discriminate active and latent TB infection in order to promptly initiate treatment to prevent mortality and further spread of the pathogen, in particular in areas where <italic>M.tb</italic> is highly endemic. Ideally, such biomarkers should also be able to discriminate between TB and other respiratory infections that present with similar symptoms and abnormalities on chest X-rays.</p><p>Many studies have identified potential biomarkers that discriminate active TB from LTBI, or that are predictive of which individuals will progress to active TB (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Differential gene expression profiles between patients with TB and LTBI or other (lung) diseases resulted in identification of an array of potential biomarkers, such as <italic>FCGR1A</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and <italic>GBP5</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recently, complement has been highlighted as candidate biomarker for active TB disease (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) also in the presence of HIV co-infection (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Most currently identified biomarkers have been identified at the transcriptomic level; however, easy, robust markers that can be measured at the protein level would be more ideal candidates for application in the field. Therefore, validation of markers previously identified at the mRNA level at the protein level would provide important insights into the applicability of such markers in clinical practice.</p><p>Next to biomarker studies in humans, there are various experimental models to study the host-pathogen interaction. The best available model is the non-human primate model (NHP), infection of rhesus macaques with <italic>M.tb</italic>, resulted in TB disease which closely resembles human TB as they experience similar lesions and clinical courses as humans, suggesting a common pathophysiology (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The NHP model adds important information on kinetics of disease development following <italic>M.tb</italic> infection and can be manipulated with e.g., different dosages of infection, different infecting strains, but also with vaccines.</p><p>The complement system is an important part of the innate immune system and functions as a proteolytic cascade. The classical complement pathway is initiated by binding of C1q to ligands, such as immune complexes. Following the binding of C1q to ligands, enzymatic processes lead to the release of inflammation stimulating peptides, C3a and C5a, formation of the opsonin C3b and formation of the membrane attack complex, resulting in target cell lysis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Furthermore, C1q can bind several receptors that contribute to other important functions, such as phagocytosis or myeloid cell modulation, outside traditional complement system activation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For instance, C1q is involved in neovascularization during pregnancy, coagulation processes and neurological synapse function (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). C1q is a 480 kDa protein composed of six arms, each comprising one A, B and C peptide chain (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These three chains are encoded by individual genes, <italic>C1QA, C1QB</italic>, and <italic>C1QC</italic>, located on chromosome 1p. In contrast to most complement proteins, C1q is not produced by hepatocytes but mainly by monocyte derived cells, such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and by mast cells (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Increased expression of mRNA for C1q has been associated with TB disease (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Here, we analyzed differential expression of complement genes in patients with TB. Since in publicly available datasets, C1q expression was most pronouncedly upregulated, we validated C1q at the protein level in samples from various patient groups as a biomarker for active TB. Patients with active TB disease were compared to latently infected individuals, vaccinnees and to patients with clinical conditions that are important differential diagnoses in clinical practice. Finally, to obtain more insight in the pathophysiology, kinetic analyses were performed samples obtained from NHP animal models of TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and controls</title><p>Demographic data and classification of the cohorts are presented in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

All data were extracted from GEO and compared in the same way using GEO2R, thus not relying on the analysis performed in the original manuscript.

All studies/populations with significant differential expression for a particular gene between patients with TB compared to LTBI/other diseases were enumerated and expressed as the percentage of the total number of comparisons investigated. E.g., differential expression of C1QA between TB and LTBI was observed in only 2/9 populations investigated (22%) whereas C1QB differed in 8/9 populations (88%).

Here, we compiled available genome wide gene expression data for TB compared to LTBI and TB compared to other lung diseases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and observed that in particular C1q encoding genes were highly upregulated. Interestingly, these observations were made in studies using RNA from whole blood, indicating increased transcription of C1q genes in circulating blood cells, most likely monocytes/macrophages. Since C1q is not a typical acute-phase protein we were interested to confirm and validate these findings at the protein level. We have therefore measured C1q protein levels in serum and confirmed increased levels in patients with active TB, but not in other diseases with a similar clinical presentation, such as pneumonia or sarcoidosis, or mycobacterial exposure. C1q protein is also present in the lung tissue of deceased TB patients. The increased levels of local and circulating C1q in TB were replicated independently in a NHP TB infection model.</p><p>Literature suggests that expression of the three C1q genes <italic>C1QA, C1QB</italic>, and <italic>C1QC</italic> is regulated in a similar manner (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, upon IFN&#x003b3;-stimulation upregulation of <italic>C1QB</italic> is higher than <italic>C1QC</italic>, which is higher than <italic>C1QA</italic> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Similarly, our data also showed upregulated expression of <italic>C1QB</italic> and <italic>C1QC</italic> genes and <italic>C1QA</italic> was less frequently observed in active TB, also in the analysis from Cai et al. the extend of increase in the expression of <italic>C1QA</italic> was less pronounced as compared to the increase in expression of <italic>C1QB</italic> and <italic>C1QC</italic>. Since C1q protein production requires equal ratios of all three chains, the detected increase in C1q protein levels in TB patients indicates that all chains are expressed. The low detection of <italic>C1QA</italic> may thus be technical and reflect a poor capture of <italic>C1QA</italic> expression on the microarrays in general.</p><p>We measured C1q protein levels in four different geographical cohorts from Italy, The Gambia, Korea and South Africa. C1q levels were increased in patients with active TB compared to all relevant control populations. Importantly, treatment normalized serum C1q levels to those of endemic controls, indicating that the upregulation of C1q was associated with the disease and not intrinsic to the individuals. BCG vaccination, although being a live replicating mycobacterial vaccine, did not induce increased C1q levels. Although leucocytes of patients with leprosy reactions were reported to express increased levels of <italic>C1QA, B</italic>, and <italic>C</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), the cohorts analyzed here did not universal show increased serum C1q levels. Individual patients might have somewhat increased levels, both in this study (type 1 reaction) and a previous report (type 2 reaction) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which warrants more detailed analyses. We speculate that the different pathophysiologies of TB and leprosy, in particular the different levels of systemic inflammation and immune activation which are generally higher in active TB than in leprosy are responsible for the difference in C1q levels between the two diseases, even though both are caused by pathogenic mycobacteria.</p><p>To further evaluate the potential of C1q as a biomarker for active TB, C1q levels were compared to those of disease relevant controls as patients with untreated pulmonary sarcoidosis or pneumonia. Patients with TB had significantly higher circulating C1q levels as compared to patients with sarcoidosis or patients with pneumonia. Thus, the upregulation of C1q likely does not reflect a general response to inflammation. Patients with pneumonia rather had decreased C1q levels compared to controls. Treatment of pneumonia normalized the levels of circulating C1q, suggesting that the observed decrease in C1q is non-genetic and likely associated with the disease process. ROC analysis indicated that C1q, even as a single marker, readily discriminated active TB from all other diseases investigated here. Furthermore, also in a setting of an experimental NHP model of TB disease we observed in both sera and BAL fluid increased C1q levels in animals with symptomatic TB disease compared to the level prior to infection with <italic>M.tb</italic>. This was not seen in animals that did not progress to TB disease, suggestion again an association with TB disease rather than infection only. These data fully agree with and support the observations described above in the human cohorts.</p><p>Longitudinal follow up of TB patients during treatment revealed that circulating C1q levels normalized to the level of endemic controls. However, here protein levels did not completely normalize until the 6 months time point. Previously published data showed a rapid decrease in C1q mRNA expression levels following treatment (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Cliff et al. show that already after 1 week of treatment the blood C1q gene expression decreased (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Cai et al. reported a significant decrease in the expression of the C1q genes at 3 months of anti-TB chemotherapy whereas they also described a reduction in C1qc protein levels after 6 months (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Our data presented here substantially expand the number of populations, including populations from different regions of the world. Transcriptomic analysis of genes encoding complement proteins were now assessed in 9 independent populations from different TB endemic as well as non-endemic regions, strongly supporting an increase in expression of C1Q as well as SERPING1 during active TB disease in cells present in peripheral blood. Moreover, 4 independent cohorts as well as the data obtained in the NHP model show increased circulating C1q plasma levels during active TB disease, but not infection. In addition to conforming the data previously published for a Chinese population (Cai et al.) in 4 different TB cohorts, we also showed the specificity for TB disease in comparison to clinically important differential diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis and pneumonia. As C1q is produced by cells of monocytic origin, it reflects another component of the immune space compared to most currently applied TB biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein and IP-10 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In addition, C1q levels are technically easy to measure and the C1q protein is not sensitive to degradation. Therefore, we hypothesize that addition of C1q to current biomarker panels or platforms, will have additive value in discrimination of TB patients.</p><p>Low levels of C1q have been reported in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. This is largely the result of C1q consumption because of immune complex mediated disease and in some rare cases caused by genetic C1q deficiency (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, the increased levels of C1q, as occur in TB, are observed very rarely. So far the only other clinical condition in which increased levels of C1q have been reported is Kala Azar (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The mechanism behind the increased C1q levels observed in TB patients, or the possible functional consequences for the host are unknown, and will need further investigation. The availability of the NHP model of tuberculosis for C1q research, as demonstrated for the first time in this study, should greatly accelerate and facilitate such work.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that circulating C1q expression is increased in 9 different populations with TB disease, moreover, elevated C1q plasma levels were observed in 4 cohorts of TB patients compared to LTBI or endemic controls. Specifically, C1q levels in TB patients were significantly increased compared clinically relevant diseases, such as sarcoidosis, leprosy and pneumonia. Moreover, we show that increased C1q levels decreased to the level of the control population during successful treatment. In analogy with human TB, C1q also validated as a biomarker of TB disease in rhesus macaques, in both serum and BAL. Increased C1q levels were only observed in animals that progressed to active disease and not in those that controlled the infection, suggesting a direct association with disease rather than with infection. Therefore, we propose that the addition of C1q measurements to current biomarker panels may provide added value in the diagnosis of active TB.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>RL, FV, AG, TO, SJ, and LT designed the study.
