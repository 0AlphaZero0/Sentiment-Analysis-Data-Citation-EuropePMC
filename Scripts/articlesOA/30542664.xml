<bold>Background</bold>: Human visceral leishmaniasis, caused by infection with
<italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> or
<italic>L. infantum,</italic> is a potentially fatal disease affecting 50,000-90,000 people yearly in 75 disease endemic countries, with more than 20,000 deaths reported. Experimental models of infection play a major role in understanding parasite biology, host-pathogen interaction, disease pathogenesis, and parasite transmission. In addition, they have an essential role in the identification and pre-clinical evaluation of new drugs and vaccines. However, our understanding of these models remains fragmentary. Although the immune response to
<italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> infection in mice has been extensively characterized, transcriptomic analysis capturing the tissue-specific evolution of disease has yet to be reported.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>: We provide an analysis of the transcriptome of spleen, liver and peripheral blood of BALB/c mice infected with
<italic>L. donovani</italic>. Where possible, we compare our data in murine experimental visceral leishmaniasis with transcriptomic data in the public domain obtained from the study of
<italic>L. donovani</italic>-infected hamsters and patients with human visceral leishmaniasis. Digitised whole slide images showing the histopathology in spleen and liver are made available via a dedicated website,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishpathnet.org">www.leishpathnet.org</ext-link>.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Our analysis confirms marked tissue-specific alterations in the transcriptome of infected mice over time and identifies previously unrecognized parallels and differences between murine, hamster and human responses to infection. We show commonality of interferon-regulated genes whilst confirming a greater activation of type 2 immune pathways in infected hamsters compared to mice. Cytokine genes and genes encoding immune checkpoints were markedly tissue specific and dynamic in their expression, and pathways focused on non-immune cells reflected tissue specific immunopathology. Our data also addresses the value of measuring peripheral blood transcriptomics as a potential window into underlying systemic disease.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our transcriptomic data, coupled with histopathologic analysis of the tissue response, provide an additional resource to underpin future mechanistic studies and to guide clinical research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Leishmania</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>host response</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>immunopathology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265"><funding-source>Medical Research Council</funding-source><award-id>MR/J008702/1</award-id><award-id>G1000230</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010757"><funding-source>National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</funding-source><award-id>NC/CO13295</award-id><award-id>NC.CO13117</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-3" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>104726</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animal in Research (NC3Rs) / Innovate UK CRACKIT Challenge Award (NC.CO13117 and NC/CO13295 to PMK, SLC, JT and JM), by a UK MRC Programme Grant (G1000230 to PMK) and by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award (WT104726 to PMK).

<italic>Leishmania</italic>, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) represents one of the most challenging to understand in terms of its pathophysiology. Unlike cutaneous leishmaniasis, where parasite growth and the pathological consequences of the ensuing immune response are largely confined to the site of transmission, VL is characterized by systemic spread of parasites, multi-organ involvement and a systemic response that is fatal without treatment. Systemic cytokine mediated immunosuppression

<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and systemic coagulopathies
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> have all been proposed as mechanisms that promote parasite survival, render the host susceptible to concomitant secondary infections and/or act as negative prognostic markers. Evidence from animal models suggests that tissue specific control over immunity and immunopathology also exists, that may in part reflect extremes within the clinical spectrum of VL
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In spite of the broad impact of infection on a range of key physiological processes, a systems-wide appreciation of the underlying immune, metabolic and physiological changes associated with VL has yet to emerge.</p><p>Over the past several years, transcriptomic profiling has been adopted as a key methodology for generating an unbiased view of many disease processes. The application of transcriptomic profiling has provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of many infectious and non-infectious diseases
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and on the response to drugs, vaccines and other immunotherapeutic interventions
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. From a clinical perspective, the application of whole blood transcriptomic profiling (WBTP) opened a new era in clinical monitoring of disease, fuelled notably by the work of Chaussebel and others that illustrated its potential to provide insights into systemic disease processes and serve as a clinical tool
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, whether WBTP provides information reflecting a subset of systemic events or is an avatar of that response remains to be fully determined. Indeed, studies formally comparing whole blood with the systemic tissue transcriptome are rare
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Transcriptomic profiling in leishmaniasis has been limited to date. In human disease, this has largely focused on cutaneous leishmaniasis
<sup><xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. A single study has reported on transcriptional changes in the draining lymph node of Sudanese patients with VL before and after treatment with sodium stibogluconate, identifying a potential role for nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-regulated immune responses in treatment response
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. One study has examined whole blood transcriptional responses in healthy controls versus asymptomatic and symptomatic VL patients in Brazil
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Three studies have evaluated transcriptional changes in the spleen of hamsters infected with

<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Here, we have applied transcriptional profiling to address key aspects of the tissue specific response to
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection in mice. We describe key differences between immune response and metabolic events occurring in the principal target organs of liver and spleen, as well as in blood, and where possible through publically available data, provide a formal comparison between the splenic response in mice and hamsters and between murine and human whole blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Bodies of the University of York and the LSHTM and the work was performed under UK Home Office license (PPL 60/4377; PPL 70/6997; PPL 70/8207).

Experiments reported here are derived from two cohorts of mice (designated CRACK-IT_1 and CRACK-IT_2; 20 mice per cohort, n=5 per infection time point and for time-matched uninfected controls). In CRACK-IT_1, mice (n=5) were killed by cervical dislocation at day 15, 17 and 21 post infection. Control na&#x000ef;ve mice were killed on the equivalent of day 14 p.i. for logistical reasons. In CRACK-IT_2, infected mice (n=5 per group) were killed at day 36 and 42, alongside a control na&#x000ef;ve group. All animals were killed and processed over an approximate time period of 4&#x02013;6h beginning in the morning. Tissues were aseptically removed post mortem and stored/processed as detailed below. All downstream tissue analysis was performed blinded to group by investigators not involved in animal handling.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and quantitative morphometry</title><p>Spleens and livers were embedded in OCT, snap frozen and stored at -80&#x000b0;, before preparing 7 &#x000b5;m cryosections.

For gross morphology, sections were fixed for 5 minutes in ice-cold acetone and rehydrated by immersion for 2&#x02013;3 minutes in 90% ethanol, 70% ethanol and finally ddH

After washing, sections were stained for 45 min with AlexaFlour 647-F4/80 or isotype control (BioLegend, USA; 1:500), counterstained with DAPI and mounted in Prolong Gold. Sections were examined using a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 with a x 20 objective. Granuloma size and distribution was quantified using image analysis software TissueQuest 4.0 (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria), blind to treatment group. DAPI was used as the master channel to identify all events within the regions of interest, and clustering of F4/80

<sup>2</sup> region of interest were identified as individual sub regions of interest, and size and cell density was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue transcriptomics</title><p>RNA was isolated from tissue/blood samples and amplified via Agilent low-input Quick Amp labelling kit (Agilent Technologies). Amplified RNA was then assayed with Agilent SurePrint G3 mouse GE 8x60k microarray chips that were scanned with an Agilent C Scanner with Surescan High Resolution Technology (Agilent Technologies). The data were normalized using the percentile shift method to the 75
<sup>th</sup> percentile. Identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes between infected and na&#x000ef;ve samples was performed using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction for pairwise comparisons of infected vs. na&#x000ef;ve samples
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Where multiple probes for a single gene were present, the average expression level was used. This analysis was performed with GeneSpring software (version 9; Agilent) as a standard 5% FDR, with the variances assessed by the software for each t test performed. A 2-fold expression criteria (Log2 FC = 1)was then applied to each gene list. For DE analysis in CRACK-IT_1, a single group of na&#x000ef;ve mice were killed at d14 for comparison with samples of infected mice taken at d15, d17 and d21 p.i. For CRACK-IT_2, DE analysis was performed using matched na&#x000ef;ve samples for each tissue taken at each time point (see Results).</p><p>Gene ontology analysis was performed using GeneSpring (Agilent), and pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems). For the identification of upstream regulators in IPA, we used the z score, which reflects the extent to which known target genes are regulated in the expected direction, whereby positive z scores predict activation of the regulator whereas negative z scores predict inhibition of the regulator. z scores of &#x0003e;2 and &#x0003c;-2 are considered significant. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> was performed to identify enriched gene sets associated with each phenotype (i.e. infected at each time point vs. na&#x000ef;ve). Data were collapsed to gene set against an Agilent mouse array chip file (~24K genes) and parameters set for GSEA were: permutations =1000; permutations type = gene set (sample n&#x0003c;7) or phenotype (sample n&#x0003e;7).

the DE genes identified at each time point post infection. Comparative analysis within Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated that IFN
<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, LPS, IL-1&#x003b2;, TLR4, TNF and STAT1 were amongst the highest scoring and significant upstream regulators predicted to be activated during infection (with activation z scores ranging from 2.89 to 9.5 and p values from ~10
<sup>-5</sup> to 10
<sup>-48</sup>), whereas IL-10RA and TRIM24 were upstream regulators that were predicted to be down regulated (z scores of ~-4 to -9 and p values from 10
<sup>-7</sup> to 10
<sup>-35</sup>;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). It should be noted that predictions made by IPA are based on the expression patterns of genes that are known to be regulated by different upstream regulators and do not require that the upstream regulator itself appears as DE in the data set. For example, at day 36 p.i., activation of IFN&#x003b3; was predicted by the changes in expression seen in 301 known IFN&#x003b3; target genes, consistent in this case with an observed Log2FC change in expression of IFN&#x003b3; of 3.474. IFN&#x003b3; was further predicted to interact with 694 genes (or 13.7%) of all DE genes via a mechanistic network involving 15 other regulators (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, using the Interferome database which contains expression data related to ~4000 interferon regulated genes (v2.01;
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>), 32.3% (1645/5096) of all DE genes scored as interferon inducible, of which 743 and 431 scored as uniquely regulated by Type I and II (IFN&#x003b3;) interferons, respectively (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, IL-10RA and TRIM24 were predicted to be inhibited based on the expression change of 108 and 41 genes, respectively, although in this case, neither of these predicted upstream regulators was itself DE. The 41 genes that predict inactivation of TRIM24 during
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection are shown graphically according to subcellular localisation in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>,. The lack of differential expression of IL-10RA and TRIM24 may reflect that function is not transcriptional regulated or that transcriptional regulation was below the Log2FC cutoff employed in this analysis (due to low abundance of cells expressing the gene of interest or only minor changes to mRNA abundance).</p><p>Finally, we examined expression of cytokine and chemokine genes as well as genes for their respective receptors, to provide a high-level view of immune pathways activated during infection in this target tissue (

In contrast to chemokine ligands, mRNAs for many chemokine receptors were found at lower abundance in infected mice compared to controls (e.g.

<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection and compare this where possible to existing data sets from other species, including humans. This high-level overview of transcriptional changes associated with infection poses a number of important questions and provides an important additional data resource for the leishmaniasis research community.</p><p>BALB/c mice were chosen for this study due to their extensive use as an immunological model of infection and as a tool for the pre-clinical evaluation of drugs and vaccines
<sup><xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. In this and most other mouse strains on a
<italic>Slc11a1</italic> (Nramp1) mutant background, such as C57BL/6, hepatic infection is self-resolving and associated with the development of granulomatous inflammation, whereas splenic parasite load persists, often for several months, accompanied by marked alterations to organ microarchitecture
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. We selected time points when hepatic and splenic parasite burden were increasing and also to reflect the time frame over which a dichotomy in host resistance becomes apparent in spleen and liver. Where possible, we have also mined existing data to look for similarities and/or differences in transcriptional response. Whilst these comparisons are informative, some degree of caution needs to be exerted on their interpretation. Platforms used for analysis of transcriptomic changes differ (Agilent gene arrays, Illumina Bead Chip arrays, RNA-Seq), with microarrays often having more limited dynamic range than RNA-Seq. For this reason, we have not attempted any quantitative comparison in expression levels across platforms. Rather, our comparisons are drawn on the basis of comparing DE gene lists generated using standard analysis and statistical tools suited for each platform. In addition, variables such as tissue parasite load and time of infection are difficult to standardise (particularly for human disease where the time of infection is usually unknown), and with the exception of our study, data is currently restricted in most species to a single tissue site. It should also be remembered that whether comparing between tissues in the same host or across species, lists of DE genes may reflect changes due to either alterations in gene expression pattern of individual cells or due to changes in tissue cell composition. Although in some cases our results were unexpected and showed dissimilarity between experimental models and human disease, this should not be taken as an argument against the value of research in such models. Rather, it stresses that once proof-of-concept has been achieved in a model, additional validation based on human data is essential. Furthermore, such human data may form the basis for selecting an appropriate pre-clinical model for the question at hand, or indeed for engineering more refined models of novel aspects of human disease.</p><p>Splenic histopathology of infected BALB/c mice, as expected, indicated extensive remodelling of the splenic architecture and the late onset of extramedullary haematopoiesis, similar to that seen in other mouse strains
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Coincident with these changes, we observed transcriptional signatures associated with the activation of immune responses, angiogenesis and coagulation pathways. Interferon-related pathways were highly dominant. Approximately 13% of the identified DE genes were predicted to be downstream of IFN&#x003b3; signalling and ~30% of all genes were scored as interferon inducible using the Interferome database
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. IPA identified two candidate negative regulators IL-10Ra and TRIM24. IL-10 signalling through IL-10Ra (CD210) is well recognised for its role in inhibiting immune clearance of

<sup><xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. TRIM24 is a bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulator protein that has recently been the focus of attention as a regulator of STAT3 recruitment during oncogenesis
<sup><xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> and as a positive regulator of Th2 cytokine production in Th2 cells
<sup><xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>. The predicted inhibition of TRIM24 would, therefore, be consistent with a dominant Th1 type immune response during murine EVL. TRIM24 is also observed as a target for inactivation during infection with lab-adapted H1N1influenza A virus
<sup><xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> and has been shown to be targetable using novel heterobifunctional protein degraders
<sup><xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>, suggesting that pathways controlled by TRIM24 could be further manipulated in favour of host protection.</p><p>In contrast to the murine EVL model, data generated by Melby and colleagues suggests that the immune response in hamster EVL favours a more prominent Th2 like response
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. In addition, their analysis also indicates that macrophages in hamster EVL are conditioned to respond to activation with the induction of a program of gene expression that favours amastigote growth, including

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>) supports the notion that these may be candidates for the development of immunotherapy, along with key suppressive cytokines like IL-10. In the mouse, these checkpoint inhibitors (along with many cytokines, chemokines and their receptors) have a complex pattern of temporal and tissue-specific regulation which, together with the potential for cell migration between sites, makes predictions concerning the impact of immunotherapy challenging. Some of these checkpoint targets are equally represented in mouse and hamster spleen and human whole blood e.g. LAG3 and CTLA4, whereas others show species restricted regulation. For example, IDO-1 is up regulated in hamster spleen and human whole blood, but not in any mouse tissue examined. Importantly, these diverse data as well as the clear dichotomy of expression at a tissue specific level, indicate the need to build a more comprehensive and uniform knowledge base regarding these pathways in different models and forms of human disease.</p><p>Analysis of whole blood has been a valuable tool for monitoring transcriptional changes associated with infection and even for predicting drug efficacy
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, but the relationship between transcriptomic changes in blood and tissue remains poorly understood. Pooling data across all tissues and time points, we were able to identify a 26-gene signature that was common to spleen, liver and blood during murine VL. 96% of these genes have been reported as interferon inducible, clearly indicating the dominant nature of interferon signalling during murine VL and that this common signature reflects disease in all organs/tissues studied. The value of defining signatures of this type might be to understand common pathways underlying inflammation or to provide new biomarkers that reflect the level of ongoing systemic disease that can be monitored in blood. We will further elaborate on the use of this signature to evaluate chemotherapy induced cure in murine VL in a subsequent manuscript (Forrester
<italic>et al.</italic> manuscript in preparation). The clinical value of this signature is however questionable at this stage, given the lack of similarity between whole blood transcriptomic responses observed in our study and that of humans with VL in Brazil
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. In a similar study in acute melioidosis, 26.9% of genes were similarly regulated in murine and human infection
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The reasons for this lack of similarity in VL are likely to be multiple, including the chronicity of infection, difference in pathogen (
<italic>L. donovani</italic> vs.
<italic>L. infantum</italic>), specific characteristics of Brazilian VL compared to VL on other continents
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or differing analytical methods. It would be informative, given the above discussion, to compare human whole blood from a greater range of patient populations with VL to better understand the extent of temporal and geographic diversity in the transcriptome of patients with VL. Likewise, data on hamster whole blood might help ascertain whether the blood transcriptome in this model more closely resembles that found during human disease.</p><p>Finally, a deeper understanding of subtleties of the immunopathology of leishmaniasis in different target tissues (e.g. granulomatous vs. non-granulomatous) and their relationship to gene transcriptional changes will require more in-depth analysis than that reported here, using new techniques to integrate image analysis with complex &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; and other meta data.

<italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> infected mouse over time in the spleen and liver. There is no comparable kinetic analysis of transcriptional changes in visceral leishmaniasis, thus indicating the significance of the work. The authors also attempt to compare their findings with published transcriptional analyses in hamster and human VL, which is useful. Overall, the study is well-done with some important caveats that the authors are aware of and which they mention in the text. First and foremost, the kinetic study in mice is a combination of two experiments and the authors might be clearer in how they handled the potential batch effects that one might anticipate seeing. Looking at Figure 2 it would appear that there are significant differences between the first experiment (Day 15, 17 and 21) and the second experiment (day 36 and 42).&#x000a0; Second, a comparison between data generated by microarray and RNAseq will have several notable issues, and while the authors mention this issue they might expand a bit on how those differences will influence interpretation of their results. It can be useful to make these comparisons, but critical to ensure the readers understand the significant caveats. Finally, it would be helpful to have a clearer discussion of what they have found out about tissue differences in response to infection between the spleen and liver, and how those differences might be responsible for differences in the parasite control that is seen in these two tissues.</p><p> The minor problem that becomes a bigger problem as it is evident in many of the figures is the inability to read several of the figures because of font size, as well as some figures that may not be informative for the readers. For example: Fig. 1C-D: arrows almost invisible: Fig. 3A. difficult to evaluate; Fig. 3C- Font size; Fig. 3E- Font size; Fig 5B (a really cool figure)- but font size too small for the labeled genes; Fig. 5C-F- difficult to interpret; Fig. 11C, D- Font size; Fig. 12C- Font size. One additional question: There appear to be no changes in the granulomas in Fig. 6B from day 21 to 42. Is this expected?</p><p> In summary, in spite of the caveats mentioned above, this study provides data that can be mined by others to better understand the immune responses in VL.&#x000a0;</p><p>I have read this submission.

<italic>1. batch effects resulting from conducting two independent experiments</italic>
</p><p> We are aware of the possibility of batch effects and have tried to control for these as best as possible.&#x000a0;The size and scale of the experiments performed for this study (and also to support additional analysis to be described elsewhere) made it logistically impossible to use a single cohort processed on the same day.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;We confirmed health status across cohorts according to FELASA guidelines and had matched &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; control mice for each cohort (and for each time point in CRACKIT_2).&#x000a0;Differential gene expression was conducted relative to these matched controls rather than to a common &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; group to further reduce batch effects. These details are described in the M&#x00026;M and Results.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic>2. issues resulting from comparison of RNA-Seq to microarray</italic>
</p><p> We have expanded our discussion on this point as suggested by the referee</p><p>
<italic>3 tissue specific differences in parasite control in spleen and liver</italic>
</p><p> We have included some additional comments on this issue throughout the manuscript.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;However, as this data represented the platform on which to base further mechanistic studies, we have refrained from making too many conclusions purely on expression data.</p><p>
<italic>4. font size of figures</italic>
</p><p> We have reviewed all the figures for legibility and where necessary either increased the font size, of re-designed the figure to improve readability. For the STRING diagrams in Figs 11 and 12, the main aim is to show the extent to which different groups of DE genes are clustered. We tried increasing font size, but this actually makes the figure less clear due to proximity of each name. We think it valuable for readers to be able to view the gene names (even if requiring zoom on a pdf version of the manuscript and so have retained a small font on Figs 11 and 12).</p><p>
<italic>5. was no difference in granulomas between d21 and d42 expected?</italic>
</p><p> There are some subtle differences in the size distribution over time, and at d42 there is already some killing of parasites within granulomas (as evident from Fig 1A).&#x000a0;This is not fully reflected in change in granuloma size, however.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article><sub-article id="report34135" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/wellcomeopenres.16203.r34135</article-id><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Syamal</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="r34135a1">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r34135a1">

<italic>et al.</italic> describes tissue specific alteration in transcriptome in
<italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> infected Balb/c mice in a longitudinal infection and compares the results with those from other species.</p><p> The number of DE probes was studied between normal and infected splenic tissues of Balb/c mice as a function of time, peaking at d36.&#x000a0; After removal of multiple probes, the number of annotated genes was 5096 set across all time points. The most commonly enriched genes were IFN-Y, TNF-&#x003b1; signalling, IL-6-JAK/STAT signaling, E2F targets, KRAS signaling and others. Interestingly these changes are coupled with extra medullary myelopoiesis in spleen. IPA showed significant upstream regulators predicted to be up regulated during infection whereas IL-10RA and TRIM24 were upstream regulators that were predicted to be down regulated, despite not being DE themselves. Using the Interferome database they could show that 32.3% of all DE genes scored as interferon inducible. Further pathway analysis was done to find upstream regulators of the DE genes. The mouse data was compared with the hamster and human data available in the literature. It is also highly appreciable that the data collected from the animals used in this study forms part of a CRACKIT Virtual Infectious Diseases Research Challenge program that focuses on generating an in silico model of the immune response during murine EVL in order to reduce the number of animals required for basic research on immune regulation and for evaluating potentially novel therapeutic interventions. Besides this, they have also made Microarray data accessible in the public domain through Gene Expression Omnibus a part of NCBI Databases.</p><p> And finally, they have confirmed that there is marked tissue-specific alteration in the transcriptome of infected mice over time and also identified commonality and differences between murine, hamster and human responses to infection that were previously unrecognized. They have shown the commonality of interferon-regulated genes while confirming a greater activation of type 2 immune pathways in infected hamsters compared to mice, and also pointed out that Cytokine genes and genes encoding immune checkpoints were markedly tissue-specific and dynamic in their expression and pathways. Through data, they have made an effort to address the value of measuring peripheral blood transcriptomics as a potential window into the underlying systemic disease. They could show a 26-gene signature that is common to spleen, liver and blood during murine VL. Oddly enough, there is a lack of similarity in whole blood transcriptomic response between mouse and human systems.</p><p> The major challenge now is the absence of an experimental model that would mimic the spectrum of human disease. Studies on the animal model provide us with a wealth of information about the host-parasite interaction, but there is no such model available that would reproduce human disease. Thus, so many questions remain unanswered in order to design control strategies. This observation re-enforces the notion that there is a gap between experimental data and human disease on leishmaniasis.</p><p> General comments:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The authors try to compare DE transcripts at d28 post infection from na&#x000ef;ve hamsters to L. donovani to 36 days post infected mice and their study is based on the best match (page 9 of 21). It will be nice if the basis for the match criterion can be elaborated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 5A is a Venn diagram showing the overlap of DE genes in page 10. It looks like a weighted Venn diagram and the authors have cited Venny 2.1 for making Venn diagram but I wonder if the weighted Venn cannot be formed by Venny 2.1.&#x000a0; It will be helpful if the tool or package that has been utilized for its formation can be included. In case it is just a normal Venn diagram then the figure requires an edit.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 5B: Please provide the citation to the tool or package that has been utilized for the correlation plot of Log2FC for mouse and hamster DE genes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are a few issues like parasite stain, duration of infection and resulting host-pathogen interaction etc that are beyond the authors&#x02019; control. This raises the question whether even monkeys can be used for testing vaccine candidates as little is known if the immune response to leishmania is similar to that observed in human.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p> Nevertheless as a whole I think it is a great effort by the group. It is a pleasure to read the article.</p><p>I have read this submission.

The strategy used is robust and very transparent. The results are in accordance with the methodology used. It will help to define new strategies for using of experimental models and to define new markers of immune response for HVL.</p><p> METHODS:</p><p> Why did the authors perform the study using two different experiments CRACK-IT_1 and CRACK-IT_2?</p><p> Tissue transcriptomics: what impact may the early amplification and removal of outliers by normalisation have had on the comparative study presented in the manuscript?</p><p> Was any additional normalization needed for comparisons performed between the data presented in this manuscript and those presented in references 39 and 41?</p><p> RESULTS:</p><p> Figures 1A and 1B_Raw (Supplementary data) The mean spleen weight of control animals at 36 days was ~4x higher than of animals with 14 and 42 days? Was the histology of these enlarged spleens similar to that observed in the other control animals? Do the authors think that including animals with enlarged spleen may have interfered with the data on gene expression?</p><p> Figure 1C-1H:</p><p> Technical details: For some reason the figures present some degree of opacity impairing adequate visualization. The blue arrows are so small that is difficult to find and the details such as infected macrophages are barely seen.</p><p> For the usual reader the loss of red pulp/white pulp differentiation mentioned by the authors in the text&#x000a0;may not be easily seen.

<italic>1.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;why two different experiments for the time course analysis?</italic>
</p><p> The size and scale of the experiments performed for this study (and also to support additional analysis to be described elsewhere) made it logistically impossible to use a single cohort infected and processed on the same day.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;To minimise batch effects, we confirmed health standard across both cohorts according to FELASA guidelines and had matched &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; control mice for each cohort (and for each time point in CRACKIT_2).&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Differential gene expression was conducted relative to these matched controls rather than to a common &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; group to further reduce batch effects. These details are described in the M&#x00026;M and Results.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic>2. impact of early amplification and removal of outliers by normalisation on the comparative study</italic>
</p><p> There are multiple reasons to be cautious in conducting comparative studies with data derived from different platforms and we discuss these in the text.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;It is difficult to know the significance of these effects, but we have erred on the cautious side e.g. avoiding direct quantitative comparisons and commenting only on DE genes identified by conventional platform specific approaches.</p><p> 3. was any additional normalisation used to compare mouse, hamster and human data sets?</p><p> We have added a further statement to the M&#x00026;M to clarify the text already in the Results section.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p> Results</p><p>
<italic>1. Fig1A/B Raw data on spleen size in na&#x000ef;ve controls at d36</italic>
</p><p> We thank the reviewer for pointing out this transcribing error in the raw data file. This has now been corrected (na&#x000ef;ve spleen weight at d36 = 86+/-5 mg)&#x000a0;</p><p> 2. improve clarity of Figure 1C-H (arrows etc, demarcation of red and white pulp)</p><p> The figures have been corrected as suggested to improve clarity</p><p>
<italic>3. comparison of spleen hematopoiesis between control and infected mice</italic>
</p><p> We have not formally compared this in the current study, but a manuscript from our group related to this issue has recently been published (Preham et al CD4
<sup>+</sup>T cells alter the stromal microenvironment and repress medullary erythropoiesis in murine visceral leishmaniasis. Front. Immunol. 2018. Doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02958).&#x000a0;</p><p>

<italic>5. Figure 6E-F changes in granuloma cell populations over time</italic>
</p><p> The F4/80 + DAPI images shown in Fig 1C-F were chosen to show representative granulomas of differing size and not to formally describe changes in cell populations over time.&#x000a0;This type of analysis has been conducted previously e.g. Moore et al PlosOne 2012. 7(3):e34134 for B and T cells and Beattie et al PLoS Path 2010. 6(3):e1000805.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;A further manuscript currently in preparation from the CRACKIT project (Hamp et al) will also contain further information on hepatic cellularity over time.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;We have added an additional sentence to the discussion to highlight that transcriptomic changes as assessed here may be due to changes in cell composition or altered transcription levels within a given cell population.&#x000a0;</p><p>

The authors address this question by looking at transcriptomes of the spleen, liver and blood of infected mice and comparing them with infected hamsters and human VL patients. I feel that their approach is reasonable and the data shown here are very useful to the research field. It will be great if the authors can strengthen the conclusion by discussing/interpreting the data more in depth.</p><p> Major comments
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors described in the Discussion that BALB/c were used in this study &#x02018;due to their extensive use as an immunological model of infection&#x02026;&#x02019;. However, the authors&#x02019; group also use C57BL/6 mice for immunological studies of experimental VL. Is there any stronger reason to select BALB/c over C57BL/6?In fact, pathogenesis/immune responses during
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection may be different between those two inbred mice. For example, in the current study using BALB/c mice, the splenic parasite burden and spleen weight were almost parallel. It means the parasite number per host nuclei are relative stable over the course of infection. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice show higher increase in LDU over spleen weight, according to Ato M et al., Nature Immunology, 2002. Also, splenomegaly by
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection seems worse in BALB/c mice (~8 times enlargement at D35) than C57BL/6 mice (only 1.7 time at D28). These differences should be welcomed because they mean that comparison of the inbred mouse strains is also a viable approach besides comparison with other species.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although the title says tissue and host species-&#x02018;specific&#x02019; changes, I feel that the article more focuses on commonality among tissues and species. For example, the last part of this work focuses on the 26 genes commonly up-regulated in the spleen, liver and blood; what is the significance of identifying such genes? The authors know that at the time point kinetics of parasite proliferation in the spleen and liver are different, so what kind of phenomena should be associated with the commonly up-regulated genes? I believe that more careful watch into differently regulated genes, across tissues and across species, is indispensable. Identification of IDO-1 as a mouse-low, hamster-high and human-high factor is really intriguing and the authors are encouraged to take further analyses to identify such &#x02018;protection-related factor candidates&#x02019; because it is supposed to be their objective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Related to the previous comment, representation of each tissue/species is a little vague. My understanding is; mouse spleen, vulnerable at D42; mouse liver, protective at D42; hamster spleen, vulnerable at D42; hamster liver, vulnerable at D42; human blood, reflecting systemic vulnerable condition. Is it correct and if yes what does mouse blood represent? Although I understand the authors know that it is not that simple, data analyses and discussions with clear and consistent hypotheses/assumptions are helpful to the readers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Page 4: Discussions on IL-10Ra and Trim24 are difficult to understand. &#x02018;Upstream regulators that were predicted to be down regulated, despite not being DE themselves&#x02019;, do you mean that they are upstream regulators for down-regulated genes? Also, what does this actually mean in the setting of murine VL? Can you also discuss the fact that IL-10 is up-regulated in the spleen at all time points and what it means in connection with IL-10Ra?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not sure what Figure 3E means, what two kinds of line means there. No description in the legend. Besides the letters are too small to see.</p></list-item></list> &#x000a0;</p><p> Minor comments:

<italic>1.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;comment on strain choice and specific differences in response to infection</italic>
</p><p>The reviewer is correct that we and others also use B6 mice extensively in studies of murine VL.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;We have expanded in the Discussion on the rationale for our choice of BALB/c mice in this study.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;However, we are currently preparing another manuscript from the CRACKIT program, which will include transcriptomic data from infected B6 as well as B6.
<italic>Rag</italic>-/- mice.</p><p>
<italic>2. why look at a common 26 gene signature? Differences across species should be pursued.</italic>
</p><p>I think in this manuscript we have done both.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;The value for a common gene signature might be in the identification of common underlying mechanisms or the identification of biomarkers that might be useful for clinical monitoring of disease progression.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;We have expanded the discussion to address this.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic>3. clarify use of different time points in different species and relation to disease pattern</italic>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we are limited by the availability of data.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Researchers working with hamsters have only studied spleen (and as their study was not published at the time we began our own investigations, we could not &#x0201c;time match&#x0201d; even if that was desirable). Researchers investigating human disease have to date only published transcriptomic data from peripheral blood. We hope our current manuscript will highlight the need for better comparative studies, but it will always be difficult to match to disease profile as these differ widely between models and indeed humans.&#x000a0;</p><p>
