It has two types of colony morphology, a smooth (S) type, producing high glycopeptidolipid (GPL) content, and a rough (R) type, which produces low levels of GPLs and is associated with increased virulence. However, the mechanism responsible for their difference in virulence is poorly known. By ultrastructural examination of murine macrophages infected, we found that MAB-R strains could replicate more actively in the macrophage phagosome than the S variants and that they could escape into cytosol via phagosomal rupture. The cytosolic access of MAB-R strains via phagosomal rupture led to enhanced Type I interferon (IFN) production and cell death, which resulted in their cell-to-cell spreading. This behavior can provide an additional niche for the survival of MAB-R strains. In addition, we found that their enhancement of cell death mediated cell spreading are dependent on Type I IFN signaling via comparison of wild-type and IFNAR1 knockout mice. In conclusion, our data indicated that a transition of MAB-S strains into MAB-R variants increased their virulence via enhanced Type I IFN production, which led to enhanced survival in infected macrophage via cell death mediated cell-to-cell spreading. This result provides not only a novel insight into the difference in virulence between MAB-R and -S variants but also hints to their treatment strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic></kwd><kwd>phagosomal escape</kwd><kwd>rough strains</kwd><kwd>type I interferon</kwd><kwd>phagosomal rupture</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>cell-to-cell spread</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="11464"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> complex (MAB) is now recognized as a major pathogen leading to pulmonary infection within the rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGMs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and is a common pathogen in lung diseases, especially in cystic fibrosis patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In South Korea, MAB lung diseases have also been increasing in frequency and account for 70~80% of RGM-induced lung diseases (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). MAB is also one of the major pathogens leading to nosocomial infections (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). MAB infections are difficult to treat due to both natural broad-spectrum resistance and acquired resistance, with disparate antibiotic susceptibility patterns being observed between different clinical strains (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>MAB consists of diverse subspecies or genotypes. Currently, the MAB group can be divided into two subspecies, <italic>M. abscessus</italic> subsp. <italic>abscessus</italic> (hereafter, S-Abs) and <italic>M. abscessus</italic> subsp. <italic>bolletii. M. abscessus</italic> subsp. <italic>bolletii</italic> was proposed to include the two former species <italic>M. massiliense</italic> (S-Mas) and <italic>M. bolletii</italic> (S-Bol) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). S-Mas can be further subdivided into two <italic>hsp</italic>65 genotypes (Type I and Type II) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>MAB consists of two phenotypes: smooth colony (MAB-S) and rough colony (MAB-R), with or without glycopeptidolipid (GPL) gene synthesis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In relation to these phenotypes, there have been reports of infection experiments using various cells such as macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and studies on the etiology of the pathogenesis in mouse models (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). MAB-S has an advantage in survival due to GPL-based biofilm formation, leading to inhibit bacteria-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). So, the MAB-R variant without outer GPL induces could induce enhanced apoptotic cell death mediated invasion ability than MAB-S (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism regarding the disparity between the pathogenic potential of MAB-R and -S types remains unknown.</p><p>Virulent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) strains have ability to escape into the cytosol from the phagosome via the type VII secretion system ESX-1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which is responsible for the secretion of the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6), and its protein partner, the 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10). <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> can escape into the cytosol via a similar strategy as virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Active phagosomal rupture in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages or dendritic cells induced by the ESX-1 system present in the genome of pathogenic mycobacteria can expose bacterial DNA in the cytosol, which in turn drives the transcription of IFN-&#x003b2; via the cGAS&#x02013;STING&#x02013;TBK1&#x02013;IRF3 axis and enhanced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion via NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The activation of both Type I IFN signaling and inflammasome systems might synergistically contribute to the enhanced virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria via damping excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Furthermore, ESX-1&#x02013;derived phagosomal rupture can result in toxicity and enhanced host cell death, also contributing to the virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria via increased intracellular bacterial growth(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Several previous studies consistently demonstrated that the MAB-R type survived more efficiently during infection into macrophage or dendritic cells than the MAB-S type (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that enhanced survival of MAB-R strains in APCs may be due to the bacteria cytosol access and subsequent phagosomal rupture. However, the previous complete genome studies of several MAB strains revealed that no orthologs corresponding to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ESX-1 genes are in their genomes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), suggesting there may be an alternative strategy facilitating cytosol access of the MAB-R type. Here, we elucidated the underlying mechanism that likely explains the distinct pathogenic potentials between the MAB-R and -S types, mainly focusing on Type I IFN signaling of MAB-R strains, the MAB-R access to cytosol rupture and their enhanced survival in macrophage via host-cell death mediated cell-to-cell spreading.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec><title>MAB-R Strains Showed Greater Intracellular Growth and Innate Immune Response in Murine Macrophage Than MAB-S Strains</title><p>Previously, MAB-R strains have been reported to better survive in macrophage and lead to more proinflammatory cytokines than MAB-S strains (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, variation in survival- or inflammation-inducing capacity between subspecies or genotypes of MAB has not been addressed. Therefore, we evaluated the intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A&#x02013;C</xref>) and pro- (TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6) and anti- (IL-10) inflammatory cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D&#x02013;F</xref>) of MAB-R and -S strains of various subspecies or genotypes [S-Abs smooth strains (S-Abs_S): <italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 smooth strain, Asan 53040, and Asan 58582; S-Abs rough strains (S-Abs_R): <italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 rough strain, Asan 52550 and Asan 58116; S-Mas type I-Smooth (S-Mas_I-S): type strain, Asan 15, Asan 51312, and Asan 51843; S-Mas type I-Rough (S-Mas_I-R): Asan 16, Asan 22, and Asan 34; and S-Mas type II-Rough (S-Mas_II-R): Asan 4, Asan 50594, and Asan 62188] in murine macrophage J774A.1 cells (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells) as a function of the 10 multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> bacteria) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). The survival of intracellular mycobacteria was examined with a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. The results showed that irrespective of subspecies or genotypes, MAB-R strains formed significantly higher levels of CFUs than MAB-S strains in J774A.1 cells. A similar growth trend was also shown in a bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, MAB-R and -S strains showed different intracellular growth kinetics. Briefly, there were no significant differences in intracellular growth between MAB-S and MAB-R infected cells at 2 h. MAB-R strains showed a marked increase in intracellular growth in BMDM as infection time increased (2 to 6 h and 6 to 24 h), but in contrast, MAB-S strains were almost invariable in intracellular growth in BMDM between 3 time points (2, 6, and 24 h). It suggests that the increased number of MAB-R strain in phagocytes may be due to its active replication within phagocytes.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of intracellular survival and proinflammatory cytokine production of MAB-R and -S strains of various subspecies or genotypes in infected murine macrophage. <bold>(A)</bold> CFU assays of MAB-R and -S strains of various subspecies or genotype [S-Abs smooth strains (S-Abs_S): <italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 smooth strain, Asan 53040, and Asan 58582; S-Abs rough strains (S-Abs_R): <italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 rough strain, Asan 52550 and Asan 58116; S-Mas type I-Smooth (S-Mas_I-S): type strain, Asan 15, Asan 51312, and Asan 51843; S-Mas type I-Rough (S-Mas_I-R): Asan 16, Asan 22, and Asan 34; and S-Mas type II-Rough (S-Mas_II-R): Asan 4, Asan 50594, and Asan 62188] (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> bacteria; 10 M.O.I.) in infected J774A.1 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) cells at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h.p.i. <bold>(B)</bold> The mean number of CFUs of various subspecies or genotypes of MAB surviving in infected J774A.1 cells. <bold>(C)</bold> Comparison of the number of CFUs from MAB-R [S-Abs_R (<italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 rough strain) and S-Mas_II-R (Asan 50594)] and MAB-S strains [S-Abs_S (<italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 smooth strain) and S-Mas_I-S (Asan 51843)] at 37&#x000b0;C at different time points (2, 6, and 24 h) after infection of BMDM at 10 M.O.I. <bold>(D&#x02013;F)</bold> Comparison of the mean value of proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-10) between various MAB-R and -S strains (10 M.O.I, at 24 h.p.i) from infected J774A.1 cells <bold>(D)</bold>, BMDMs <bold>(E)</bold>, and BMDCs <bold>(F)</bold>.

Both of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 were more induced in two different macrophages (J774A.1 cells and BMDMs) and in BMDCs infected with MAB-R strains than in those infected with MAB-S strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D&#x02013;F</xref>). In addition, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also more induced in MAB-R strain-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D&#x02013;F</xref>). The expression of GPL, which is known to inhibit TLR2 signaling (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), is reduced in the MAB-R strains, and thus the expression of cytokines induced by MAB-R strains is increased, compared to MAB-S strains. Together, these results indicated that MAB-R strains showed increased intracellular growth and innate immune responses in murine macrophage than MAB-S strains, irrespective of the taxonomic status of subspecies or genotype. It also suggests MAB-R strains may promote enhanced airway inflammation compared to MAB-S strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased Multiplication of MAB-R Strains in the Macrophage Phagosome Leads to Bacterial Phagosomal Escape After Phagosomal Rupture</title><p>To better understand the mechanism underlying the different growth kinetics during macrophage infections of MAB-R and -S strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>). We conducted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining of infected murine macrophage. First, J774A.1 cells were infected with MAB-R and -S strains at an M.O.I. of 10 for 24 h (see Experimental procedures). After extensive washing to eliminate the residual extracellular bacteria, cells were fixed and processed for AFB staining. The results showed that while only a few MAB-S strains were phagocytized and confined into small phagosomes, several MAB-R strains were clustered in a few large phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, while the number of surviving MAB-S cells were almost always invariant at different time points [(0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 18 h.p.i. (hours post-infection)], the numbers of MAB-R cells within phagosomes appear to be increased with infection time, suggesting their active replication in phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This AFB staining data prompted us to hypothesize that MAB-R but not MAB-S, actively replicated in phagosomes in the initial phase of macrophage infection and that then bacterial overgrowth beyond the phagosome capacity could lead to phagosomal rupture. To further prove this hypothesis, BMDMs were infected with MAB-R and -S strains, and the intracellular localization of the bacteria was examined 24 h.p.i. by TEM. As previously reported (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), in MAB-S strains, single bacteria were located in a phagosome, and the outermost electron translucent zone (ETZ) (marked as a small arrow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>), which is a major part of the mycobacterial cell wall, was thick and poised all around the phagosome membrane. In contrast, MAB-R strains displayed a very thin ETZ, and several bacteria (up to more than 10 bacilli) were located in a larger phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also found several pieces of TEM evidence supporting active multiplication through the binary fission of MAB-R in a phagosome of BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that the increased initial intracellular growth of MAB-R strains in macrophage may be due to the its active multiplication within the phagosome (bacterial replication indicated with an asterisk). In addition, our TEM-based study also showed that while MAB-S strains were primarily localized within membrane-bound vesicles within the phagosome, a few MAB-R strains could move from the phagosome into the cytosol of macrophages (marked as a black arrow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, we also found that in some cases of MAB-R-infected macrophages, bacteria were released into the space, even with a concomitant rupture of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>), which is consistent with a previous report that the bacterial cytosol access after phagosomal rupture could lead to cell-to-cell spreading via cell membrane ruptures (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Furthermore, to prove cytosol access of MAB-R strain, we investigated colocalization of MAB-R strains and a late endosome marker (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), LAMP-1 via confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1E,F</xref>, the colocalization of MAB-R with LAMP-1 was significantly lower than that of MAB-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) at the 4 h.p.i and 24 h.p.i. Furthermore, colocalization intensity between MAB-R strains and LAMP-1 were decreased according to increase of infection time (4 to 24 h.p.i) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1E,F</xref>), strongly supporting our TEM based finding of phagosome escape of MAB-R strains.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Morphological evidence of phagosomal escape and subsequent phagosomal rupture in MAB-R-infected murine macrophage. <bold>(A)</bold> AFB stain images of macrophages infected with MAB-R strains [S-Abs_R (<italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 rough strain) and S-Mas_II-R (Asan 50594)] and MAB-S strains [S-Abs_S (<italic>M. abscessus</italic> type strain ATCC 19977 smooth strain) and S-Mas_I-S (Asan 51843)] at 10 M.O.I. for 24 h.p.i.

Recently, the orthologous ESX-4 locus in <italic>M. abscessus</italic> genome has been reported to be capable of elicit phagosome membrane rupture and be essential for the intracellular survival of <italic>M. abscessus</italic> in amoeba or macrophage, strongly supporting the possibility that ESX-4 may operate as a surrogate for ESX-1 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Indeed, we found via TEM and AFB staining that abrupt increases in the intracellular growth of MAB-R strain during the initial phase of infecting macrophages (6 to 24 h.p.i.) was due to their active multiplication in phagosome, leading to phagosomal rupture via their overgrowth beyond phagosome capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1B,D</xref>), which could consequently lead to their escape into the cytosol. Our TEM and AFB staining data indicated that even in some MAB-R-infected cells, bacterial release into the extracellular medium from destroyed cell membranes occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1C,D</xref>), suggesting a possible link between the phagosomal escape of MAB-R strains by phagosomal rupture to cell death-mediated bacterial cell-to-cell spreading. The bacterial escape into the cytosol via overgrowth in phagosomes that was exhibited by MAB-R strains has not been previously reported. However, whether ESX-4 locus of <italic>M. abscessus</italic> could contribute into active replication in phagosome, phagosome escape, and intracellular survival of MAB-R strains in infected macrophages should be elucidated in the future.</p><p>In contrast to MAB-R strains, the MAB-S strains rarely increased their intracellular growth in the initial stage of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting a lack of growth in the phagosome, which is consistent with our TEM data showing a single bacterium per vacuole in most vacuoles and no evidence of phagosomal rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1A</xref>). The disparity in phagosomal rupture-inducing capacity between MAB-R and -S types can lead to distinct damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) responses between the two groups. Indeed, we found that MAB-S strains produced lower amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 than MAB-R strains in infections of murine macrophage or dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D&#x02013;F</xref>). Furthermore, the contrast in produced cytokines between live and HK bacteria was less pronounced in MAB-S-infected macrophage than in MAB-R-infected macrophage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S6</xref>). It has been reported that MAB-S infection is more prevalent during initial infection from environments, but after infection, a morphotype change from the MAB-S type into the MAB-R type frequently follows (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, in macrophage infections with both morphotypes, MAB-S strains may enable the initial infection and the colonization into macrophage by minimally evoking host immune responses like a latent infection of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and their transition into the MAB-R type could broaden its niche for intracellular survival in the late phase of infection at the expense of evoking host immune responses.</p><p>In addition to TEM-based evidence, there are two other findings (biochemical evidence and PCR-based detection) supporting the presence of cytosol stages of MAB-R strains in infected macrophage. First, we also found that irrespective of the types of their subspecies (S-Abs or S-Mas) or genotypes (Type I or Type II of S-Mas), MAB-R strains but not MAB-S strains induced IFN-&#x003b2; secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), ISRE-dependent luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the transcriptional expression of downstream interferon-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) in an IRF3-dependent manner in infected BMDMs or BMDCs, further providing clear biochemical evidence for their cytosol access. Moreover, our finding that only their live strains and not HK strains induce IFN-&#x003b2; secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) proves that their induction of Type I IFN may be due to DAMP (cytosolic bacterial DNAs)-dependent intracellular signaling rather than extracellular signaling by membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLR3 or TLR9. Indeed, we also found an increase in activated STING proteins in MAB-R-infected BMDM or BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting the direct sensing of cytosolic bacterial DNA. For the second piece of evidence supporting the cytosol stages of MAB-R strains, we directly detected the presence of cytosolic MAB DNA by a PCR method targeting mycobacterial <italic>hsp65</italic> genes in MAB-R-infected murine macrophages (J774A.1 cells and BMDMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>Type I IFN plays a pivotal role in immunity and inflammation in an autocrine or a paracrine manner via interactions with its receptor, IFNAR1, which is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cells (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Although the host-protective functions of Type I IFNs have been well-described in viral infections, they are also generally considered to have a detrimental effect on diseases caused by intracellular bacteria, such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). For example, in humans, a comparable IFN-inducible gene signature was observed in the blood of TB patients as well as in 10&#x02013;25% of latently infected individuals, suggesting that the whole-blood IFN signature could be useful in identifying active TB disease (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Furthermore, a recent <italic>in vivo</italic> mice study proved that coinfection with a virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection could increase the severity of other viral infections such as influenza in a Type I IFN signaling-dependent manner (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Since avirulent or saprophytic mycobacteria cannot induce type I IFNs, it is hypothesized that Type I IFN production is associated with mycobacterial virulence and increased host susceptibility (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Furthermore, Induction of Type I IFN has also been reported to lead to proliferation of intracellular bacteria such as L. monocytogenes within macrophage via inhibiting macrophage activation by IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, our findings of enhanced Type I IFN production in virulent strains (MAB-R) strains but not in the less virulent type (MAB-S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A,B</xref>) also support the above hypothesis. Therefore, chronic stimulation of the Type I IFN signaling pathway, induced by MAB-R infection, could compromise host-defense immune responses against its infection and affect disease progression by other infections co-infecting with MAB-R, such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or influenza.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Schematic representation showing phagosomal rupture-mediated phagosomal escape of MAB-R in infected murine macrophage, leading to Type I INF production via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 axis. Live <italic>M. abscessus</italic> (MAB-R and -S) move into macrophage cells by phagocytosis. However, different life styles within macrophages were found between MAB-R and MAB-S strains. MAB-S strains remain silent in the phagosome and cannot lead to phagosomal rupture mediated escape to cytosol. So, MAB-S strains also cannot activate Type 1 IFN production via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway. However, MAB-R can replicate in the phagosome (1) and cause phagosomal rupture (2). MAB-R can escape to the cytosol (3), which produce Type I IFN (IFN&#x003b2;) via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway (4). Furthermore, MAB-R can move to adjacent cells by Type I IFN receptor-dependent cell-to-cell spreading. ESX-4 locus, which has been recently reported to be related to phagosomal rupture (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), may contribute into replication in phagosome (1), phagosome rupture (2), and escape into cytosol of MAB-R (3). Finally, secreted IFN-&#x003b2; by MAB-R infections could also contribute into bacteria proliferation by interfering with IFN-&#x003b3; signaling pathway (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-10-00125-g0008"/></fig><p>Apoptotic cell death via phagosomal rupture in pathogenic mycobacterial infection can lead to cell-to-cell spreading, which contributes to their survival in macrophage (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). A recent study showed that Type I IFN signaling induced by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infections contributes to their virulence via cell-to-cell spreading (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Indeed, in this study, we proved that enhanced apoptotic cell death by MAB-R strains leads to cell-to-cell spreading in an IFNAR1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that Type I IFN in MAB-R strains contributes to their enhanced virulence via providing a niche for their survival within macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that Type I IFN can promote cell to cell spreads of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophage or in livers of infected mice, which is mediated by formation of actin comet tails via IFNRR1 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). So it is tempting to speculate that Type I IFN dependent cell-to-cell spread of MAB-R strains as shown in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), may also be due to the similar mechanism as shown in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). However, issue regarding actin based motility or actin comet formation of MAB-R strains for cell-to-cell spread remain to be addressed in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicated that the transition of MAB-S variants into R variants increases their virulence via enhanced Type I IFN signaling, which leads to enhanced survival in infected macrophage via their cell death-mediated cell-to-cell spreading.

The results were acquired as cycle threshold (Ct) values and represented the average of at least two independent experiments. The relative amount of mRNA (2<sup>&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>Ct</italic></sup>) was obtained by normalizing its level to that of the &#x003b2;-actin gene in each experiment.
