<sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, is frequently used to analyze cellular differentiation mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. HL-60 cells differentiate into macrophage-like cells and granulocytic cells after treatments with 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In particular, it has been shown that the expression of a number of genes is augmented during differentiation induced by TPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recently, TPA was successfully administered to patients with myelocytic leukemia, leading to temporary remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This TPA-treatment is based on a concept that the growth and proliferation of lymphoma or cancer cells could be artificially suppressed if they are forced to differentiate into a non-growing state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, TPA has been originally identified as a cancer-causing reagent (carcinogen) activating protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, extreme care will be needed to administer the reagent in clinical situations.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that somatic cells could be converted into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by introducing just four transcription factors, namely <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, and <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Myc</italic> expression vectors or their encoding proteins, into somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The possibility to change the destiny of cells by introducing transcriptional factors prompted us to study transcription systems that control cellular differentiation. In order to establish a method to convert malignant cells to the non-growing differentiated state without using TPA, it will be important to determine and characterize molecular mechanisms in the transcriptional signal transduction systems that are induced by TPA. In other words, the changes in the TPA-induced transcriptional controlling system will provide useful information about which genes of transcription factors should be transfected into the malignant cells.</p><p>Previously, it has been demonstrated that the human <italic>PARG</italic> promoter is activated during the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by TPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another example is the <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> promoter, whose cDNA was isolated by South-Western screening during a search for a gene encoding a binding factor to a 50-bp sequence of the MMTV LTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, there are no obvious TATA- or CCAAT-boxes around the transcription start sites (TSS), but the duplicated GGAA motifs are commonly contained in the region between the TSS and the 100-bp upstream of the human <italic>PARG</italic> and <italic>IGHMBP</italic> genes. In addition, mutation analyses showed that the duplicated GGAA motifs of both promoters play a primarily important role in promoter activity during the TPA-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Taken together, the duplicated (overlapped) GGAA motifs located very close to the TSS in the human <italic>PARG</italic> and <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> promoters are primarily required for the initiation of transcription during TPA responses. Studies on the transcriptional mechanisms regulated by the duplicated GGAA motifs and binding factors may provide a new strategy to artificially induce differentiation of leukemia or cancer cells by introducing specific gene expression- and suppression-vectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Identification of the duplication of the GGAA motifs near the most 5&#x02032;-upstream regions of the TPA-inducible genes</title><p>It has been indicated that the GGAA motif is located in the promoter regions of some human genes encoding interleukin-2 receptor &#x003b2;-chain (IL-2R&#x003b2;), Ets-2, stromelysin 1, TCR&#x003b1; enhancer, TCR&#x003b2; enhancer, and NFAT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mutation of the GGAA motif abolished activity of the <italic>IL</italic>-<italic>2R&#x003b2;</italic> promoter during the PMA response in Jurkat cells. These observations, including ours that we reported in a recent paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggested a hypothesis that the GGAA motif might be an essential transcription regulatory element with a positive response to TPA-induced signals. By analyzing the activities of various promoters of human genes encoding DNA helicases, or repair-associated proteins, it has been shown that the duplicated GGAA motifs are located in the <italic>XPB</italic>, <italic>RTEL</italic>, and <italic>Rb1</italic> promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been reported that, during the macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells, <italic>Rb1</italic> belongs to a group of TPA-inducible late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, the expression of the <italic>PARG</italic> and the <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> genes shows a late responding profile, and the gene encoding the GA-binding transcription factor, &#x003b2; subunit 2, is classified into the early response group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Multiple GGAA motifs are contained in the promoter region of the human <italic>CD68</italic> gene that is widely regarded as a pan macrophage marker in immunohistochemistry studies, and its expression is regulated by Elf-1, PU.1, and IRF-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These observations suggested that duplications of the GGAA motifs are necessary for the TPA-late response or macrophage-like differentiated state of the cells. Therefore, DNA sequences of the 5&#x02032;-upstream regions of 19 late response genes were investigated and analyzed by a TF-SEARCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, duplications of the GGAA motifs are found in eight TATA-less promoters, including the <italic>Rb1</italic>, <italic>CD31(PECAM1)</italic>, <italic>IL1R1</italic>, <italic>IL1R2</italic>, <italic>IL1RAPL2</italic>, <italic>S100A3</italic>, <italic>eIF3A</italic>, and <italic>ECM1</italic> promoters. The 5&#x02032;-flanking regions of the <italic>INHBA</italic> and <italic>S6 kinase</italic> genes contain clusters of GGAA motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, promoter regions of the <italic>IL1R1</italic>, <italic>IL1R2</italic>, and <italic>IL1RAPL2</italic> genes, which encode the IL1 signal receptor or its associated proteins, have duplicated GGAA (TTCC) motifs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), suggesting that these genes are regulated by the IL1 signaling system. Although a single GGAA motif is located very close to the TSS of the <italic>PEA15</italic>, <italic>ANXA5</italic>, and <italic>RFC</italic>-<italic>1</italic> genes, another six promoters, including those of the <italic>LGALS3</italic>, <italic>PREP</italic>, <italic>CHST10</italic>, <italic>RFXAP</italic>, <italic>P2Y5</italic>, and <italic>KCNMA1</italic> genes, do not contain duplications of the GGAA motifs within the 300-bp from the most 5&#x02032;-upstream region of their cDNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Except for the <italic>P2Y5</italic> promoter, which contains TA-rich sequences with Oct-1 binding sites, these are comparatively rich in GC content with GC-boxes. Therefore, Sp1 or GC-box binding proteins might also play a role in the late response to TPA treatment in HL-60 cells.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Duplication of the GGAA motifs in various human promoters</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Genes</th><th align="left">Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>IL-1&#x003b2;</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-GAAGC<bold>TTCC</bold>ACCAATACTCTT<bold>TTCC</bold>CCT<bold>TTCC</bold>TTTAA-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>CD31 (PECAM-1)</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-CCTCA<bold>GGAA</bold>GGCCGGTCAT<bold>TTCC</bold>TGAGG-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>IL1R1</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-TGTTC<bold>TTCCTTCC</bold>CCAGG-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>IL1R2</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-TCACA<bold>TTCCTTCC</bold>TACGC-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>IL1RAPL2</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-CTCAT<bold>TTCC</bold>AGGCGCCC<bold>TTCC</bold>CTCTT-3&#x02032; (downstream of TSS)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>S100A3</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-AGCAA<bold>TTCC</bold>A<bold>GGAA</bold>GGGC<bold>TTCC</bold>CCTCC-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>eIF3A</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-GCTCC<bold>TTCC</bold>T<bold>TTCC</bold>GTCTC-3&#x02032; (downstream of TSS)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>ECM1</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-GTGGC<bold>TTCC</bold>AGAGGAGGAGCAGCTGGGACTGAGTCATGGCA<bold>GGAA</bold>GCTGA-3&#x02032; (downstream of TSS)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Rb1</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-CGGGC<bold>GGAA</bold>GTGACGTT<bold>TTCC</bold>CGCGG-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>CD41 (ITGA2B)</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-AAGAC<bold>TTCC</bold>TGTGGA<bold>GGAA</bold>TCTGAAG<bold>GGAA</bold>GGAGG-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>PDCD1</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-ACAGT<bold>TTCC</bold>C<bold>TTCC</bold>GCTCA-3&#x02032; (downstream of TSS)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>ISG15</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-CCTCG<bold>GGAA</bold>AG<bold>GGAA</bold>ACCGA-3&#x02032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>CD40 (TNFRSF5)</italic></td><td align="left">5&#x02032;-TTGTG<bold>GGAA</bold>TGTTCTGG<bold>GGAA</bold>ACTCC-3&#x02032;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The 5&#x02032;-upstream regions (300&#x02013;500&#x000a0;bp upstream from TSS) of the human <italic>IL</italic>-<italic>1&#x003b2;-</italic> and TPA-inducible late responding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] were retrieved from the GRCh37 reference primary assembly sequence database and analyzed with the TF-SEARCH program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html">http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html</ext-link>).

It has also been reported that IRF-2 drives megakaryocytic differentiation via activation of the promoter of the <italic>TPOR</italic> gene encoding a thrombopoietin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These observations imply that transcriptional activation by the <italic>cis</italic>-acting effect of the duplicated GGAA motifs plays an important role in the differentiation of megakaryocytic cells as well as macrophage-like cells. Moreover, it has been reported that the ISRE of the mouse <italic>programmed death</italic>-<italic>1 (PDCD1)</italic> promoter contains duplication of the GGAA (TTCC) motifs and plays a role in the response to IFN-&#x003b1; in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The <italic>PDCD1</italic> gene encodes an immuno-regulatory receptor that belongs to the CD28 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, duplication of the GGAA motifs is found in the interferon-responsible promoter regions of the human <italic>interferon</italic>-<italic>stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and <italic>CD40 (TNFRSF5)</italic> gene that encodes TNF receptor super family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Within 500&#x000a0;bp upstream from the TSS, the duplicated GGAA (TTCC) motifs are found in 5&#x02032;-flanking regions of the <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>OAS2</italic>, <italic>OAS3</italic>, <italic>IFI6</italic>, <italic>IFI44</italic>, <italic>IFI44L</italic>, <italic>IFIH1</italic>, <italic>IFITM3</italic>, <italic>TAP1</italic>, <italic>GBP2</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>STAT2</italic>, <italic>CD274</italic>, <italic>CXCL10</italic>, <italic>IFIT5</italic>, and <italic>IRF7</italic> genes. Therefore, the duplicated GGAA motifs and/or the recognizing factors might play a part in the regulation of those gene expressions responding to the signals evoked by IFNs. Recent study showed that IFN-&#x003b3;-producing macrophages, which co-express CD68 molecule, are identified in 70% of human melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

In addition to the <italic>IL1R</italic> gene, <italic>IL7R</italic> gene expression could be regulated by the duplicated GGAA motif. In mouse T cells, it has been shown that GABP regulates transcription of the <italic>IL7R</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Duplication of the GGAA motifs is found in the intronic promoter region of the human Glucose-dependent insulinotoropic polypeptide-encoding gene <italic>GIP</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The GIP can stimulate insulin release from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells when blood glucose concentration increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These lines of evidence suggest that the GGAA motifs regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins that are involved in not only cellular differentiation but also in the immuno response and endocrine systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The GGAA-microsatellite-containing genes in the human genome: the main target sequences for EWS/FLI to function as an oncoprotein</title><p>Repetitive sequences are known to be located in eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres, which are composed of TTAGGG repeats, are located at the end of linear chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The centromere is a specific structural domain of the chromosome with important functions to segregate chromosomes accurately, and many protein components of the centromere have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A centromere protein (CENP) B box, which is recognized by CENP-B, is a 17-bp motif containing GGAA and it appears within every other &#x003b1;-satellite repeat (171-bp) in human chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Those repetitive sequences are generally referred as microsatellites. Ewing&#x02019;s sarcoma is a tumor in which Ets family members are involved in chromosomal translocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12) in the malignant solid tumor generates the EWS/FLI oncoprotein that functions as an aberrant transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

The probability that the consensus 14-bp sequence would be duplicated by chance within the 50-bp distance would be extremely rare. Therefore, we explored the duplicated 14-bp sequences 2,000&#x000a0;bp upstream and 200&#x000a0;bp downstream of the TSS of 47,553 human genes extracted from the Ensembl database. The computer-based in silico analysis retrieved 469 examples with one or more duplications of the 14-bp sequence, including 234 instances of protein-encoding genes of known function or structure. Eighty percent (372/469) of the genes having consensus 14-bp sequence lacks TATA-box, and 74% (345/469) of that have GGAA(TTCC) duplications within 500&#x000a0;bp upstream (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Therefore, duplicated GGAA motifs could regulate expression of the genes encoding proteins that are associated with the TNF signal cascade. Moreover, several promoters of glucose metabolism associated genes (<italic>G6PD</italic>, <italic>GYS1</italic>, and <italic>SLC2A13</italic>) have been identified to contain the duplication within the 450&#x000a0;bp upstream of the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

Quantitative ChIP analysis indicated redundant binding of these transcription factors to the promoter regions of the <italic>COX17</italic> and <italic>DFFA</italic> genes that are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

Thus, the genome-wide promoter ChIP analysis indicated that 5&#x02013;15% of the 17,000 human promoters are redundantly occupied by these Ets proteins. Bioinformatic studies have also indicated that Ets-like binding sites are over-represented in human promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Our <italic>in silico</italic> search analysis retrieved 195 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Group A and B combined) genes that represent only 1% of total genes. This unexpectedly low value may be resulted from somewhat stringent condition for the first screening to find duplications of the <italic>PARG/IGHMBP2</italic> promoter-like GGAA motifs. Given that each Ets family protein has preferential flanking sequence of the GGAA (TTCC), our selected 14-bp might have restricted candidate genes. Recently, overlap between ChIP-seq peak data indicated several preferential combinations of the Ets family proteins that depend on cell lines used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The occupancy of Ets proteins in the same promoter region could be explained by alternative binding of the Ets proteins on the same binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Another explanation is that there is a separate binding site containing duplicated or overlapped GGAA (TTCC) motifs for each factor around the TSS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Biological properties of the Ets family proteins&#x02014;functions as proto-oncogene products</title><p>An oncogene, <italic>v-ets</italic>, was identified from the E26 avian leukemia virus in 1983 and a large family of conserved genes were isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].

The amino acid sequences of the human Ets domains were aligned and their binding sequences have been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The Ets family proteins not only have similarity in amino acid sequences (Ets domains) but also have similarity in their recognizing DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

It is noteworthy that the TTCC motif-overlapped EtsB sequence, 5&#x02032;-<bold>TTCC</bold>T<bold>TTCC</bold>-3&#x02032;, which is the same as the one located in the <italic>eIF3A</italic> promoter (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), is found close to the TSS of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. Analyzing sequences of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter from non-small cell lung cancers revealed that mutations of the TTCC motif correlate with low levels of telomerase activity and short telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. It should also be noted that palindromic Ets-binding sites are located in the promoter region of the human <italic>TP53</italic> gene and that Ets1 binds to the sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The biological relevance of Ets1 to transcriptional activity of the <italic>TP53</italic> promoter has been shown in embryonic stem cells undergoing apoptosis induced by UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. A recent study indicated that the nuclear apoptosis-enhancing nuclease encoding <italic>AEN</italic> gene is a target of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. It has been reported that the death-activated protein kinase (DAPK) family modifies MDM2 and p21 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The <italic>AEN</italic> and <italic>DAPK3</italic> promoters were identified by our search algorithm (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), suggesting that genes encoding p53 and its associated proteins are commonly regulated by the duplicated GGAA motifs at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, palindromic Ets binding sites in the <italic>CRYAB (alphaB</italic>-<italic>crystallin)</italic> gene promoter are positively regulated by Ets1 in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor, ESE-1, which is abundantly expressed in human breast cancer, has been reported to have transforming activity in MCF-12A human mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that the Ets family member ETV1 works as a regulator of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in combination with oncogene product KIT protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Whole genome sequencing analysis of human prostate cancer suggested that TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein generated by gene rearrangement causes aberrant transcription or chromatin structure and that it is correlated with the tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. As described above, the GGAA motifs are duplicated in the human <italic>PARG</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It should be noted that the duplicated GGAA motifs are located in the promoter region of the human <italic>PARP-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] and <italic>p21</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] genes, which encode poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase and Cdk inhibitor, respectively. Taken together, these observations suggest that Ets family proteins regulate cancer development or tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Apoptosis regulating functions of Ets family proteins</title><p>Apoptosis or programmed cell death is known to be regulated by various factors including caspases, DNases, or signal transduction proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. The importance of Ets family proteins in the regulation of cell-death has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].

The caspase-1 gene is also up-regulated by PU.1 in erythroleukemia cells undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The activation of <italic>caspase-1</italic> gene expression could be explained by the presence of the Ets binding sequence located in the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Ets family proteins have been shown to regulate apoptosis of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The repeated GGAA motifs are located in the promoter region of the human <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> gene and the Erg transcription factor has been shown to bind to that sequence in a ChIP assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Expression of antiapoptotic genes, including <italic>Bcl-XL</italic> and <italic>cIAP</italic>, is regulated by Ets1 and Ets2 during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. In human mesothelioma cells, Ets2 and PU.1 up-regulate <italic>Bcl-XL</italic> transcription to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].

TBP2 is thought to cause apoptosis through activation of ASK1 and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Moreover, the Ets1 binding site is present in the proto-oncogene <italic>Pim-3</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Up-regulated <italic>Pim-3</italic> gene expression caused by Ets1 is thought to prevent apoptosis in cancer cells.

Sequential complex formation occurs at transcription initiation sites very close to the TATA-box where the TATA-binding protein (TBP)/TFIID complex binds first, then TFIIA, TFIIB, RNA pol II-TFIIF, TFIIE, and the DNA helicase TFIIH assemble to make a large protein complex known as the transcription machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. The very first step of this RNA pol II-mediated transcription-initiating reaction begins with the recognition and binding of the TBP protein to the TATA-box. However, the TATA-box is not always found near the most 5&#x02032;-upstream region of the cDNA. It was reported that about 76% of human core promoters lack TATA-like element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that 81% (279/345) of the genes having duplication or more GGAA consensus 14-bp sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] in the 2,000-bp upstream region contain overlapped GGAA(TTCC) motifs within 500&#x000a0;bp upstream and have no TATA-box. The promoters that have no TATA-box near the TSS are usually known as TATA-less promoters, and they have a high GC content and frequently contain Sp1 binding sites, SC<bold>GGAA</bold>GY, or TGCGCANK motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. If the general transcription factors need to be recruited onto the TATA-less transcription initiation site, other <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences and binding protein factors are required for the initiation of the transcription reaction in mammalian cells.</p><p>It should be noted that the overlapping GGAA motif-containing sequence, 5&#x02032;-CCTAT<bold>GGAA</bold>ACACA<bold>GGAA</bold>GTGAC-3&#x02032;, is found in the <italic>TBP</italic> promoter region and the <italic>ets</italic> motif has been shown to play an important part in regulation of the promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>].

Moreover, it has been reported that the epithelium-restricted Ets transcription factor, ESX binds to TBP, and that the ETS family transcription factor, ERM, interacts with TAFII40 and TAFII60 as well as TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that PU.1 plays a role in recruiting the TBP/TFIID complex to the <italic>defensin-1</italic> promoter around the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. It should also be noted that Defensin &#x003b1;1 protein is encoded by the genes <italic>DEFA1</italic> and <italic>DEFA1B</italic> whose promoters locate tandem repeat GGAA motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>] as listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. These lines of evidence suggest that the ETS family proteins not only directly affect transcription of the <italic>TBP</italic> and its associated protein-encoding genes, but also guide general transcription factors, including TBP, towards the TSS of the duplicated GGAA motif-harboring promoters. Recently, the crystal structure of Elf3, which is a member of the Ets family of proteins, was revealed to bind to GGAA motifs of A- and B-sites of the <italic>type II TGF-&#x003b2; receptor</italic> (<italic>TGF-&#x003b2; RII</italic>) promoter, and it was concluded that regions flanking the Ets domain are essential for DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. The presented model describing binding of the Elf3 with A- and B-sites in the <italic>TGF-&#x003b2; RII</italic> promoter region suggests that the duplication of the GGAA motifs might give a scaffold for general transcription factors near the TSS. In other words, tandemly repeated GGAA motifs might give rise to a fundamental position for the pre-initiation complex to bind around the TSS without TATA-box like sequences. The overlapped GGAA motifs may have advantages to control transcription precisely only by the expression levels of the Ets family members according to the behavior of cells to proliferate, differentiate, undergo apoptosis, or respond to IFN-induced signals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, it could be happening that the promoter of the same gene is active in specific cells while it is attenuated in other cells depending on the GGAA-motif binding protein expression profiles.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Hypothetical transcription controlling system in which duplicated GGAA (TTCC) motifs and Ets family proteins are involved. <italic>Closed circles</italic> represent GGAA (TTCC) motifs that are located near the TSS.

The <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;</italic> gene is synergistically regulated by PU.1 and IRFs through their binding to the PU.1/IRF composite element that is located &#x02212;2.8&#x000a0;kb from the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. The GGAA motif and other transcription factor binding site(s) can co-operatively affect promoter activity of various genes. For example, Sp1 is a transcription factor that binds to the GC boxes with the consensus sequence 5&#x02032;-(G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T)-3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032;-(G/T)(G/A)GGCG(G/T)(G/A)(G/A)(C/T)-3&#x02032; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. It has been reported that both the GGAA motif and the Sp1-binding element play important roles in regulating transcription of the human <italic>VE-cadherin (CDH5)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] and <italic>presenilin 1</italic><italic>(PS1)</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Interactive regulatory function of the Sp1 and Ets-1 has been observed in the promoter region of the murine guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptor-A-encoding gene, <italic>Npr1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. Moreover, GABP and Sp1 co-operatively regulate human <italic>Heparanase1 (HPR1)</italic> promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>] Oct-1, which is encoded by <italic>POU2F1</italic> gene, belongs to POU homeo-domain transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Members of this family recognize and bind to the octameric sequence ATGCAAAT to activate transcription of various genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Oct-1 and PU.1 is involved in the control of the murine <italic>CD45 (Ptprc)</italic> promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Characterization of the promoter region of the <italic>Fibroleukin (FGL2)</italic> gene revealed that the <italic>cis</italic>-elements, Oct-1, Ets1 and Sp1/Sp/3, co-operatively regulate its transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. Similarly, the human <italic>BTK</italic> gene promoter, in which duplicated GGAA motif is located, is regulated by binding of Sp1/Sp3, PU.1, and Oct-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. Furthermore, c-Ets and the POU homeo-domain transcription factor, GHF-1/Pit-1 enhances Ras/Raf to activate the rat <italic>prolactin (PRL)</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that human <italic>prostacyclin receptor (PTGIR)</italic> gene promoter is regulated by Sp1, PU.1, and Oct-1 elements, and a schematic model was presented to suggest that Sp1-PU.1-Oct-1 ternary complex might recruit pre-initiation complex, including TBP, TFIID, and RNA pol II, to the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. It has been shown that Ets1 and RUNX1 bind DNA co-operatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Recent genome-wide analysis of human promoters revealed that Elk1 and Ets1 bound regions are frequently occupied with SRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>], and CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>], respectively. Moreover, it has been reported that AP1 element is co-located with ETS binding site in the promoter regions of several tumor invasion/metastasis-associated protein-encoding genes, such as <italic>MMP-1/type I collagenase</italic>, <italic>MMP-3/stromelysin</italic>, <italic>MMP-7/matrilysin</italic>, and <italic>MMP-9/type IV collagenase</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that transcriptional initiation may be co-regulated by the Ets family proteins in co-operation with GC-box binding factors, POU homeo-domain transcription factors, and other transcription factors including RUNX1, SRF, CBP, and AP1 binding factors at the region close to the TSS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Duplication of the GGAA motifs is found within a 500-bp distance of the TSS of various genes. Several of these genes are classified as intermediate and late responding genes during the macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by TPA. The duplicated GGAA motifs are located in the promoter regions of genes encoding interleukin-, interferon-, TNF-signal-associated proteins, apoptotic factors, cancer-causing proteins, tumor suppressors, or cell cycle controlling proteins including Rb and p53. Almost all these promoters have no obvious TATA-box, suggesting that the duplicated GGAA motifs play important roles in precisely recruiting the pre-initiation complex near the TSS. Redundant occupation of the duplicated GGAA motifs by Ets family proteins seems to be a complicated system, but this would enable finely tuned regulation of each promoter through altering composition of Ets family proteins or GGAA-binding proteins in the nucleus in response to cellular signals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the duplication of the GGAA motifs contained in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the human <italic>TBP</italic> gene is essential for regulating promoter activity. To date, initiation of transcription is explained mainly by the binding of TBP onto the TATA-box. Here, we propose an alternative transcription initiation mechanism where the duplication of the GGAA motifs is primarily required for determining the TSS in eukaryotic cells and for regulating expression of various genes. Further investigations into the regulatory mechanisms of the duplicated GGAA motif-containing promoters will enable the development of a new treatment for leukemia and malignant tumors by introducing Ets family protein expression vectors into cells.</p></sec>
