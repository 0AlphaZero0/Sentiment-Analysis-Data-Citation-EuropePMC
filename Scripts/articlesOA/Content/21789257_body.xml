<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lower respiratory tract infections are the single largest cause of death in low income countries and the fourth largest cause of death in middle and high income countries <xref rid="pone.0022401-Restrepo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Waterer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The infections may be caused by bacteria (e.g., <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>) or viruses (e.g., influenza). Influenza virus infects 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the world's population each year and results in approximately 500,000 deaths annually <xref rid="pone.0022401-vanZylSmit1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A third of the world's population is thought to be infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) <xref rid="pone.0022401-Waterer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition, the emergence of pathogens that may be released through acts of terrorism, such as <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (Ft), creates new public health concerns <xref rid="pone.0022401-Dennis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. While therapies and vaccines exist for many of these infections there is a need to increase our understanding of the early host response to these infections. For example, when new influenza viruses appear each year due to antigenic variation, the early immune response can either be excessive leading to increased morbidity and mortality, or be inadequate thereby allowing the pathogen to spread beyond the confines of the lung <xref rid="pone.0022401-McGill1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Comparing and contrasting the early host responses to diverse pathogens will provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of emerging and biodefense pathogens.</p><p>Experimental animal models are commonly used to study the natural history of specific infections and the response to vaccines. The murine model is an attractive model used in studies of influenza <xref rid="pone.0022401-Kuiken1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Mtb <xref rid="pone.0022401-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> infection due to the wide availability of immune reagents and genetically altered mouse strains. The mouse model has drawbacks, however, since the pathogenesis of infections may not fully recapitulate human infection. The non human primate, such as the macaque, has emerged as a model that may more closely resemble human disease in studies of both influenza <xref rid="pone.0022401-Cilloniz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Mtb <xref rid="pone.0022401-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Flynn2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our study examines the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained from mice and macaques to respond to the same pathogens. This provides a unique opportunity to compare responses to important pulmonary pathogens both within, and between, species that are relevant to human disease.</p><p>AM are the first cells of the innate immune system to interact with pathogens invading the lung <xref rid="pone.0022401-Wissinger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These cells line the alveolar spaces and, in the steady state, maintain an anti-inflammatory environment in the lung, maximizing gas exchange between airspaces and the bloodstream <xref rid="pone.0022401-Wissinger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This anti-inflammatory environment is promoted by cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2; and cell surface molecules such as CD200/CD200R <xref rid="pone.0022401-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Snelgrove1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. When pathogens enter the lower airways, AM respond to the presence of molecules derived from pathogens, as well as cytokines or molecules associated with cellular damage that may be secreted by infected epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that pathogens can ensure survival either by thwarting activation of AM <xref rid="pone.0022401-Bosio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or by inducing an over-exuberant response, which may lead to immunopathology <xref rid="pone.0022401-Kobasa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Infection with some pandemic influenza strains can induce an intense inflammatory response <xref rid="pone.0022401-Cilloniz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) leading to increased morbidity and mortality. In contrast, infection with virulent bacteria such as Ft results in low levels of inflammatory cytokine production, allowing the bacteria to escape immune-mediated destruction and disseminate systemically <xref rid="pone.0022401-Elkins1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0022401-Carlson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>A better understanding of how AM respond to a wide array of pathogens is important for the design of novel therapeutic agents that might be used to treat potentially lethal pulmonary infections. To assess the different strategies AMs use to respond to infectious agents, we performed a large scale study to compare responses to both bacterial and viral pathogens, in two species; C57BL/6 mouse and cynomolgus macaque <italic>(Macaca fascicularis)</italic>. The goal of this study was to collect a large dataset profiling the dynamics of the responses in these two species. As we show, such datasets can serve as a resource for studying similarities and differences between innate immune responses both within and between the two species.</p><p>We examined responses, using Luminex and microarrays, to the bacteria Mtb and Ft subspecies <italic>tularensis</italic>, strain Schu S4. (Schu S4) and two influenza A viruses, A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) (Fuj/02) and the mouse adapted A/PR8/34(H1N1) (PR8). Mtb causes a chronic infection characterized by granulomatous inflammation and progressive pathology in the lungs of mice, whereas macaques infected with a low dose of Mtb either develop active or latent TB in a manner very similar to human infection <xref rid="pone.0022401-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Fuj/02 is a human influenza virus that causes a productive infection in mice and causes only mild infection in macaques, whereas PR8 causes a lethal infection in mice and only mild infection in macaques. <italic>In vivo</italic> infection with Schu S4 is rapidly lethal in mice and has around 30&#x00025; mortality in macaques. These studies provide a comprehensive analysis of the response of a key cell type in the pulmonary innate immune system and identify differences and similarities between the responses to acute and chronic infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of alveolar macrophages from mice and macaques</title><p>AM isolated from C57BL/6 mice and cynomolgus macaques by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;/lo</sup> and negative for CD86.

Using these criteria a total of 1383 mouse and 1387 macaque DE genes were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022401.s004">Table S1</xref>).

The dendrograms were produced using hierarchical clustering of DE genes as described in the Methods. No significant tree topology was identified for the macaque datasets. This appears to be related to the higher degree of activation observed in the mock infection, which may be due to the fact that these animals are exposed to more inflammatory stimuli in their housing and environment. However, it appears that the responses elicited by PR8 influenza, Schu S4, and Mtb are more closely related to each other than to mock or Fuj/02 influenza infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which correlates with the observed pattern of cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar analysis of the mouse datasets reveals that Schu S4, PR8, and mock-infected cells cluster together (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.065). Mtb infected cells induced a distinct response (p-value 0.029) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). A more detailed global view on similarities and differences across species was obtained using SoftClust to cluster genes in both species across all pathogens <xref rid="pone.0022401-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Like <italic>k</italic>-means SoftClust attempts to maximize a target function that is based on the agreement of genes with the clusters they are assigned to by modifying the cluster centers in an iterative manner. However, SoftClust also tries to maximize the assignment of orthologs to the same cluster allowing it to overcome problems related to noise and arbitrary boundary of clusters. This weight guarantees that orthologs are assigned to same cluster unless there is a strong evidence to separate them. We used SoftClust to cluster all data in this study. The conservation rates for the different infections across species with no reward are &#x0223c;8&#x00025; on average and under the intermediate orthology reward value the conservation rates are &#x0223c;15&#x00025; on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) with insignificant increase in cluster variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). General clustering trends for DE genes show that orthologs are clustered 4 times more within species than between pathogens highlighting the differences between the infections progression in the two species and the need for cross species study. Examining co-clustering of infections and mock arrays we found out that mouse PR8 influenza is clustered 24&#x00025; more with the mock arrays compared to the other infections, consistent with the lack of cytokine production observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022401-g001">Figure 1C</xref> presents the 20 resulting clusters obtained under an intermediate orthology reward. Each cluster contains genes from both species and from all pathogens. Cluster 2, which is upregulated early in the response, is enriched for inflammatory response (corrected p-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;18</sup>), immune response, and chemokine activity for all macaque infections and macrophage differentiation for viral infections. Cluster 9 is enriched for immune response for bacterial infections in both macaque and mouse (corrected p-values of 10<sup>&#x02212;35</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> respectively), but viral infections are enriched for immune response only in macaque (10<sup>&#x02212;32</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of a core set of immune response genes</title><p>Examination of the almost 1400 DE genes in murine and macaque AM revealed a core set of 91 genes that were DE in both species.

Several human immune response genes have been identified based on studies in mice and other species. However, while sequence and overall function of genes are highly conserved, in several cases responses to the same pathogens, or to drugs, differs between humans and mice. Thus, in order to study the similarities and differences of the innate immune response system we need to supplement sequence data with functional genomics data.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Similarities and differences in the innate immune response between mice and macaques</title><p>In this paper, we present a resource that will allow researchers to perform such comparisons, both within and between species. To facilitate within species studies we looked at responses to both bacteria and viruses. To allow for cross species comparisons, we studied both mice and macaques. For these, we studied the response of an important cell of the pulmonary innate immune system, the alveolar macrophage (AM), to infections. We identified a core set of genes that was upregulated in AM from both mice and macaque and are implicated in the response to virus pathway. We also observed that, in both species, pathogens that cause lethal infection induced weak or absent responses in exposed AM. This suggests that blunted induction of responses in AM is correlated with an inability to control infection, indicating the importance of the innate response in the airways for initial control of infection by pathogens. Infection of murine or macaque AM with Mtb induced robust cytokine production but the patterns of gene expression changes in the two species were largely non-overlapping. Divergent responses to two influenza A viruses were observed in mice and macaque AM, such that murine AM failed to respond to the lethal PR8 influenza virus, whereas macaque AM responded robustly to this virus, but weakly to Fuj/02 influenza. The response of murine AM to the Schu S4 appeared to be aborted, whereas macaque AM responded vigorously to this challenge. These results provide a global view of the innate immune response to varied pathogens and highlight some important species differences.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Lethal influenza viruses do not induce strong response in AM</title><p>AM play important roles in controlling viral replication <xref rid="pone.0022401-McGill1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and limiting immunopathology <xref rid="pone.0022401-McGill1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Snelgrove1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> following acute infection with influenza viruses. In the case of influenza, depletion of macrophages prior to infection leads to uncontrolled viral replication <xref rid="pone.0022401-Tumpey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and a recent study has implicated the chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) in alveolar regeneration following influenza infection. Mice treated with anti-CCL2 mAb had reduced cellular infiltration, including macrophages and neutrophils, following influenza infection <xref rid="pone.0022401-Narasaraju1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, further implicating the role of macrophages in the resolution phase of the infection. The PR8 influenza virus used in this study was a mouse-adapted strain that causes severe morbidity and mortality in mice, but causes minimal disease in macaques or humans. In <italic>vitro</italic> exposure of murine AM to PR8 influenza failed to induce a cytokine response. Analysis of the gene expression profile demonstrated that the pattern induced by PR8 influenza was indistinguishable from mock-infected AM. This effect was specific to murine AM since macaques AM were able to mount a robust response, as detected by cytokine production and gene expression profiling. A previous study <xref rid="pone.0022401-Reading1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> analyzed the ability of several influenza A viruses to infect murine macrophages. Results showed that PR8 had the lowest rate of infectivity and this was correlated with a reduced ability to bind to the mannose receptor <xref rid="pone.0022401-Reading1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This suggests that one of the adaptations acquired by PR8 is a reduced ability to be taken up by AM, thereby avoiding the induction of a robust innate response. In contrast <italic>in vivo</italic> infection with PR8 influenza does induce cytokine/chemokines production in the lung <xref rid="pone.0022401-Buchweitz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Toapanta1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and this is likely due to direct infection of airway epithelial cells, leading indirectly to macrophage activation <xref rid="pone.0022401-Herold1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The human Fuj/02 influenza virus does not cause disease in mice and murine AM responded vigorously to this virus. While the Fuj/02 influenza virus does not cause a lethal infection in macaques we did observe a reduced response to this virus in macaque AM. Overall these results suggest that the more lethal influenza viruses have evolved to avoid either being taken up by AM, or inducing a strong inflammatory response, thereby allowing the virus to replicate and cause severe symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Schu S4 employs active mechanisms to abort activation of infected AM</title><p>Schu S4 infection of murine AM failed to induce a robust cytokine response as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0022401-Bosio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Telepnev1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It has been shown that Schu S4 productively infects macrophages and escapes from the phagosome into the cytoplasm where it rapidly proliferates and kills the cell <xref rid="pone.0022401-Clemens1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We have observed that the doubling time for Schu S4 is around 3 hours in murine macrophages. We observed two distinct gene expression patterns in murine AM infected with Schu S4. In the first, immune response genes such as IL-6, IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b2; were upregulated one hour following infection but this upregulation rapidly returned to baseline and was not sustained. In contrast, the expression of some genes under the control of the IRF7 transcription factor, including IRF7, IKK-&#x003b5;, mx2, rsad2, oas1 and oas3, was delayed compared to other infections and only observed late in the course of the infection. These results suggest that Schu S4 employs active mechanisms to abort activation of infected AM, leading to a blunted innate immune response to this lethal pathogen. Again AM from macaques did respond to infection with Schu S4 as seen both by the levels of cytokines produced and the pattern of gene expression. Few studies have examined Schu S4 infection in cynomolgus macaques but the few reports that exist suggest that it is a serious infection with a high level of mortality <xref rid="pone.0022401-MatzRensing1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The more robust response to Schu S4 infection by macaque AM could be related to the general immune status of macaques as evidenced by the overall increased activation seen in the mock infected AM. Unlike the mice, which were housed in microisolator cages, the macaques used in this study were kept in an environment that exposed them to normal air, and therefore potentially to microorganisms. This exposure could have altered the ability of AM to respond to Schu S4 infection, a concept that was recently reviewed <xref rid="pone.0022401-Hussell1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and is potentially more similar to the human situation.

This infection therefore provided a useful opportunity to analyze the similarities and/or differences between these two species. Our own experience with Mtb infection in macaques suggests that the macaque model is much closer to human TB than the mouse model <xref rid="pone.0022401-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

While the sets of differentially expressed genes in both mice and macaques showed over-representation of GO categories related to the immune response, and similar sets of cytokines were induced in both species, the gene expression profiles were quite distinct. Most of the genes DE in Mtb-infected murine AM were unchanged in Mtb-infected macaque AM and some genes exhibited opposite patterns of expression. The same was true when we compared the expression patterns of DE genes in Mtb-infected macaque AM with the same genes in Mtb-infected murine AM. These results suggest that caution should be employed when extrapolating data from murine models of Mtb to the human situation, although data from humans must be generated to demonstrate which model more closely reflects initial encounters with Mtb by human AM.</p><p>Examination of the DE genes following Mtb infection did however reveal a core set of immune response genes that were upregulated in both murine and macaque AM. In contrast to Schu S4 Mtb replicates more slowly with a doubling time in macrophages of approximately 24 hours <xref rid="pone.0022401-Bodnar1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus, the more robust response seen to Mtb could reflect differences in the kinetics of bacterial growth. There were a total of 91 genes that were DE in both species and 47 of these were upregulated across all infections. The 91 DE genes is a rather conservative estimate because of the strict thresholds used. Pathway analysis of these 47 genes revealed that they mostly belonged to the response to virus pathway and included such genes as IFN-&#x003b2;, IRF7, mx2, RSAD2, CCL5, CXCL10 and OAS2. This may indicate that many viruses, including influenza virus, have developed ways to antagonize these pathways to increase infectivity, whereas Mtb does not employ this technique. Previous studies have indicated that Mtb infected macrophages do activate the interferon pathway <xref rid="pone.0022401-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0022401-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

In one study intranasal treatment of mice with a TLR3 agonist prior to and during Mtb infection led to increased severity of disease and failure to control bacterial growth <xref rid="pone.0022401-Antonelli1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. A study of blood transcriptional signatures in human patients with latent or active TB revealed that an interferon signature was associated with active TB <xref rid="pone.0022401-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> Thus the activation of this pathway by Mtb infection may be a mechanism that allows the bacteria to better survive in the AM.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our analysis of AM infection with a variety of pathogens in two species identified both similarities and differences in the way these species responds to the infection. We identified roughly 50 genes that participate in the response to all pathogens we tested in both species. These genes are enriched for several immune response categories and likely represent a core immune response group. In addition, we demonstrated the similarities across species in the way these innate immune cells respond to lethal versus non-lethal pathogens. PR8 influenza and Schu S4, both lethal pathogens in mice, failed to induce a response in AM. In contrast, both species displayed a robust response to Mtb infection. On the other hand our results identified several species and pathogen specific response patterns indicating that care should be taken when using a murine model to study human diseases. Overall our data provides new insights into mechanisms by which the innate immune system responds, and interacts with, invading pathogens.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in accordance with standards established in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

An aliquot of Mtb culture (Day 5, 6, or 7) was washed with DMEM at 1700 rpm for 7 min. Mtb was suspended in BAL media and sonicated using a Virsonic probe sonicator. Mtb was added to AM at a moi of 2. Schu S4 bacteria were used to infect AM at an MOI of 20. Supernatants and cells were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours post infection. Supernatants were filtered and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0; C until they were assayed for cytokine production. Supernatants from cultures infected with Schu S4 were filtered and treated with gentamicin prior to removal from ABSL3 conditions. The cells were collected and immediately placed in TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.

Normalization was done using d-chip using the median array of time point zero as the reference after applying log<sub>2</sub> transformation to all values. Replicates in each time point were merged by taking the median over all replicates in that time point, that were not filtered out due to extreme values. Time points that showed replicate fluctuation of more than 99&#x00025; quantile of the array or were spiking compared to the rest of the time series were removed and estimated using KNNimpute <xref rid="pone.0022401-Troyanskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Genes with more than two time points removed were discarded completely. Since we had generated a large number of time point 0 arrays we generated a single set of values for this time point for each of these species by taking the median value for the 33 mouse and 15 monkey replicates at this time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Dendrogram analysis</title><p>The dendrograms were produced using hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed monkey and mouse genes. At each time point, replicates were collapsed into a single value. Then the median value of all nonzero time points of each DE gene was used to generate an inter-disease distance matrix using 1- Spearman correlation as the distance metric. Hierarchical clustering was then performed using average linkage. To obtain a measure of confidence for each branch in the dendrogram, we randomly permuted the gene expression values within each disease and produce corresponding dendrograms as described above. Among the 1000 permuted dendrograms, we counted how many times a particular clade was observed and recorded its frequency. This frequency reflects how frequently we were to observe such node structure by random, and thus provides a measure of confidence for each branch within the dendrogram.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Soft clustering analysis</title><p>Due to factors such as measurement error and ambiguity of cluster boundaries, we found that available clustering methods led to situations in which orthologous genes with similar expression patterns could be misplaced into different clusters. Accordingly, we used a &#x0201c;soft&#x0201d; clustering approach that integrates expression profiles with gene sequence orthology in a modified <italic>k</italic>-means model. This algorithm includes an adjustable weight that rewards ortholog co-clustering. Unlike standard clustering methods, which focus solely on cluster coherence, the soft clustering method can simultaneously detect both similar and divergent behavior between orthologs. When orthologs are not co-clustered despite the addition of a reward, we can be assured that their dynamic profiles truly differ. The reward weight <italic>W</italic> and the number of clusters <italic>k</italic> were scanned over a range of values [0,0.5] and <xref rid="pone.0022401-Flynn2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022401-Buchweitz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> respectively, over 50 random start repeats.

Thus, the model generated by DREM encodes a mapping from motif data to the observed temporal expression values. The resulting set of hidden states and transitions between them leads to a global dynamic map. Each gene is then assigned to a specific path in the map based on its time series expression data and the set of motifs identified in its promoter region. Following this assignment we compute association scores for TFs (that bind to the identified motifs) and splits using the hypergeometric distribution enrichment calculation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022401.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
<bold>Alveolar macrophages express a distinct pattern of response to TLR ligands</bold>. (A). Murine AM were exposed to a series of TLR ligands to characterize their responsiveness to defined stimuli. After 18 hours of stimulation by LPS, CpG or poly I&#x02236;C to engage TLR4, TLR9 and TLR3 respectively, cells were examined for changes in phenotype. (B) Poly I&#x02236;C induced a robust up-regulation and LPS a more moderate up-regulation of CD86. There was no change in CD80 cell surface expression and only a slight increase in MHC class II following exposure to poly I&#x02236;C or LPS. CD11b expression increased on the cell surface following exposure to media alone or CpG, and was unaltered when cells were exposed to LPS or poly I&#x02236;C. (C, D) Luminex analysis of supernatants (SN) from these cultures revealed three main patterns of cytokine production: cytokines induced by LPS alone, such as IL-6, TNF and CXCL1 (KC); cytokines induced by poly I&#x02236;C alone, such as IFN-&#x003b2;, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL5 (RANTES); and those induced by both LPS and poly I&#x02236;C, such as CCL3 (MIP-&#x003b1;) and CCL4 (MIP-&#x003b2;). This pattern of cytokine production is indicative of activation of the MyD88/NF-&#x003ba;B (LPS), TRIF/IRF3 (LPS and poly I&#x02236;C) and TRIF/IRF7 (poly I&#x02236;C) pathways in these cells. No cytokines were detected following exposure to medium alone or CpG, consistent with the observation that murine AM do not express TLR9.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022401.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022401.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>
