However, immunological determinants of host-pathogen interactions resulting in disease progression, latency or clearance remain poorly understood.

However, these studies revealed only limited insight into human resistance or susceptibility to MTB infection. More recently, genome-wide transcriptome analyses have been widely used to explore the complex interaction between human and bacteria <xref rid="pone.0024290-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, results varied due to diverse genetic background of the study population and the inherent complexity of the disease process and the immune response. In addition, most of these microarray studies used the peripheral whole blood without stimulation by MTB-specific antigens, which may lead to interference with other conditions than TB and skew the resulting TB-associated transcription profiles and candidate genes used for discriminating TB from LTBI.</p><p>To better understand the immunologic characteristics of different status of TB infection and to identify potential immune biomarkers that could discriminate active disease from latent infection, we performed genome-wide transcription analysis of PPD-stimulated PBMCs from subjects with TB, LTBI and HC, and identified unique transcript profiles in individuals with tuberculosis infection and active disease. The identified signatures will not only provide new insight into the immune mechanisms involved in MTB infection but also furnish new biomarkers which may distinguish active TB patients from LTBI individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of differences in gene expression profiling of PBMCs in response to PPD in TB, LTBI, and HC groups</title><p>Based on our hypothesis that PBMCs from individuals with different MTB infectious status could exhibit distinct transcription profiles when stimulated by PPD, we isolated PBMCs from 12 subjects (TB&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4, LTBI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4, HC&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4) and then stimulated them with or without PPD for 4 hours.

In this study, we described the global gene expression differences in TB, LTBI and HC, and identified distinct transcriptional signatures of tuberculosis infection and active disease. Most importantly, we found that the combination of CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6 could be used as novel biomarkers to differentiate TB from LTBI.</p><p>Unlike most previous microarray studies on TB using non-stimulated whole blood <xref rid="pone.0024290-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the present work examined transcriptional profiles using PPD-stimulated PBMCs to concentrate on detecting changes in immune response specific to MTB infection and therefore to identify TB-specific gene expression changes. To our knowledge, this is the first study using MTB-specific antigens as stimulus to activate PBMCs which are known to contain both monocytes and lymphocytes needed for recalling immune response and elucidate the complex immune responses present in different status of TB infection.

Similarly, our data showed that signaling pathway of IFN-&#x003b3; displayed significant difference with a corrected <italic>P</italic> value &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0032 in the comparison between TB and LTBI, implicating its crucial role in immune response against MTB infection.</p><p>In the multivariate analysis, despite IL2RA exhibiting significant difference in expression between TB and LTBI by qPCR (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0073), it was excluded from the final diagnostic combination of CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the correlation of expression between IL2RA and CXCL10 was significant with R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.63 and <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.0001, indicating their close association and similarity in expression pattern for both LTBI and TB conditions, and therefore inclusion of IL2RA into the diagnostic combination is unlikely to improve the discriminative power of the test any further. Eventually, the measurement of PPD-stimulated changes in mRNA levels for CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6 was validated as the best predictor distinguishing TB from LTBI, with 71&#x00025; sensitivity, 89&#x00025; specificity, and 81&#x00025; of individuals correctly classified.

The present study indicates that this three-gene panel possesses the capacity to serve as novel diagnostic biomarkers separating TB from LTBI.</p><p>In microarray validation study, there were four genes exhibiting remarkable difference in TB group compared with LTBI group with <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.01: ATP10A, CXCL10, TLR6 and IL2RA. ATP10A belonged to the family of P-type cation transport ATPases with a well-defined phosphorylation domain <xref rid="pone.0024290-Meguro1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and subfamily of aminophospholipid-transporting ATPases <xref rid="pone.0024290-Herzing1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. ATP10A was suggested to be imprinted and associated with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0024290-Dhar1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Though other ATPases such as ATP1B3, ATP8B2, and ATP6V0E1 were reported to be differentially expressed genes between TB patients and LTBI individuals in the O'Garra study <xref rid="pone.0024290-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, ATP10A was for the first time found as a differentially expressed gene which was more repressed in TB patients than in LTBI individuals upon PPD stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024290.s003">Table S2</xref>). ATP10A was reported to play roles in transmembrane movement of small molecules, but whether this function is related with TB susceptibility and resistance remains tentative.</p><p>CXCL10, also known as IP-10 (IFN-&#x003b3;-induced-protein 10), is a CXC chemokine produced by several cell types such as monocytes and T cells, and is located on chromosome 4 in a cluster with CXCL9 and CXCL11. In the current study, the expression levels of these three genes (CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) did show a notable consistency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024290-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024290-t003">3</xref>). The binding of CXCL10 to receptor CXCR3 can contribute to pleiotropic effects, including stimulation of monocytes, natural killer and T-cell migration and modulation of adhesion molecule expression <xref rid="pone.0024290-Booth1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Weng1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Expression of CXCL10 has been reported in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, through recruiting monocytes and activating T-cells into sites with tissue inflammation <xref rid="pone.0024290-Farber1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, elevated levels of CXCL10 have been reported in plasma and infection foci in individuals infected with MTB <xref rid="pone.0024290-Azzurri1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Ruhwald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. As a potential marker for the diagnosis of MTB infection, CXCL10 had been used to improve the sensitivity of IGRAs <xref rid="pone.0024290-Ruhwald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Lighter1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, while few reports its performance in distingushing between TB and LTBI. Here in our study, CXCL10 exhibited good diagnostic power in discriminating TB from LTBI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024290-t004">Table 4</xref>). Its expression was highly up-regulated by PPD in TB patients, but not in individuals with LTBI in our microarray and biomarker validation study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024290.s003">Table S2</xref>). This strong up-regulation of CXCL10 in PPD-stimulated PBMCs from TB patients may reflect its active role in the inflammatory process involved in TB pathogenesis.</p><p>TLR6 variant was documented to contribute to human susceptibility to TB <xref rid="pone.0024290-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and was up-regulated in fresh unstimulated whole blood of patients with active pulmonary TB (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) compared with healthy donors <xref rid="pone.0024290-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In contrast, our data showed that TLR6 expression in PBMCs was down-regulated by PPD in TB patients whereas almost no change in LTBI individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024290.s003">Table S2</xref>). Such variance may result from the use of the stimulus of the specific antigens and needs to be further validated within a larger number of samples. Heterodimers of TLR2 with TLR6 have been reported to be responsible for the recognition of soluble factors of MTB <xref rid="pone.0024290-Bulut1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and this ligation of TLRs may trigger either MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent pathways involving in the initiation of T-cell mediated immunity <xref rid="pone.0024290-Pasare1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Given the important role of TLRs in innate immunity and initiation of adaptive immune response, the diverse regulation pattern of TLR6 expression in TB and LTBI was likely to be a factor responsible for the different clinical outcome following MTB infection, which needs to be future investigated.</p><p>IL2RA, also known as CD25, is the alpha chain of the IL2 receptor which is present on activated T cells and B cells <xref rid="pone.0024290-Muraguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Uchiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Antigen binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) stimulates the expression of IL2 and IL2R, which can subsequently stimulate the growth, differentiation and survival of antigen-selected cytotoxic T cells <xref rid="pone.0024290-Stern1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Beadling1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Beadling2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This feature may favor the elimination of intracellular MTB. IL2RA is also surface marker of regulatory T cells (Tregs). It was reported that Tregs could inhibit Th1 responses and its frequency was high in active tuberculosis compared with uninfected donors and individuals with latent infection <xref rid="pone.0024290-Marin1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024290-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In our study, the expression level of IL2RA induced by PPD was also higher in TB than that in LTBI group.</p><p>In summary, we analyzed comprehensive gene expression patterns associated with different MTB infectious status, and confirmed that the combinations of CXCL10, ATP10A, and TLR6 could be used as reliable predictor for active TB. These findings would not only have important implications for developing novel diagnostic biomarkers to differentiate active disease from LTBI, but also shed light on immune mechanisms underlying human staying latency or progression to active disease after infection with MTB and the immunological determinants promoting this transformation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human subjects</title><p>Patients with active TB were diagnosed based on the following criteria: clinical signs and symptoms including fever, cough and productive sputum; a suggestive chest X-ray; positive Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli or positive culture for MTB in sputum.
