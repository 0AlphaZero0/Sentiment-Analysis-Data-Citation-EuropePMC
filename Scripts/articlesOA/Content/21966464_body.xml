<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Close to one-third of the world's population is infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), with infection rates highest in poverty-stricken countries in Africa and Asia <xref rid="pone.0025230-Stop1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The majority of infected persons remain asymptomatically (latently) infected with the pathogen, while 10&#x00025; progress to active TB within their lifetime, resulting in 2 million deaths per year <xref rid="pone.0025230-Stop1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A better understanding of what constitutes protective immunity to TB is critical for development of improved diagnostics, treatment protocols and vaccines.</p><p>The abundance of latently infected individuals world-wide constitutes an extremely large reservoir which fuels TB reactivation and subsequent transmission. However, the relatively low proportion of people that progress to active TB disease suggests that natural immunity to MTb is the general rule, although this also complicates evaluation of intervention studies. The majority of TB biomarker studies to date have focused on differences between subjects with active TB compared to latently infected counterparts <xref rid="pone.0025230-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0025230-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These have shown the unequivocal role of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and IFN-&#x003b3; production in TB immunity <xref rid="pone.0025230-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0025230-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, yet do not allow distinction between the underlying cause of progression to active TB and the dynamics of immune changes leading to or resulting from this progression. Other potential immune markers for determining susceptibility or protection to TB, including T cell and B cell subsets <xref rid="pone.0025230-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, type I IFN signalling pathway <xref rid="pone.0025230-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and apoptotic and innate immune regulators <xref rid="pone.0025230-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> all need to be validated in longitudinal cohort studies that monitor contacts of TB cases (TB case-contact study (TBCC)) for TB disease progression <xref rid="pone.0025230-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. One such study in The Gambia followed 2348 contacts of TB cases for 2 years resulting in 26 progressors of which half were positive by TST at recruitment and half were positive by ELISPOT <xref rid="pone.0025230-Hill2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Other studies have examined the predictive values of IFN-&#x003b3; release assays (IGRA) and TST responses at baseline but have also shown inconclusive results <xref rid="pone.0025230-Diel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025230-Lienhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Clearly, more complex immunological parameters need to be assessed in order to determine more sensitive bio-signatures of protection or susceptibility. This will not only aid in development of effective TB vaccines but will ultimately reduce TB transmission rates by enabling identification and early-treatment of susceptible individuals.</p><p>This study provides the first detailed description of the immunological differences between TB progressors and non-progressors at early time points after contact with the index TB case, in most cases many months before the onset of disease. We compared plasma cytokine levels, peripheral blood immune cell phenotypes and whole blood RNA gene expression. These data provide an initial platform for determining biomarkers of protective immunity to TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants were recruited between September 2002 and September 2004. Household members were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had been sleeping in the same compound (walled group of houses) as the index case during the index case's period of illness with TB. All contacts underwent a clinical assessment and had a Tuberculin Skin Test (TST: 2 tuberculin units (TU) of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) RT23, Staten Serum Institute, Denmark) using the Mantoux technique. Subjects with skin test induration of &#x02265;10 mm diameter were categorised as TST positive. Those with a negative TST at baseline had a repeat test after 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Study participants were followed formally for 2 years and passively after that. Each individual was re-evaluated for symptoms of tuberculosis at each visit. All TB suspects received a chest radiograph and sputum analysis for acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture. If tuberculosis disease was bacteriologically confirmed, patients were referred for the standard six month tuberculosis treatment course. Blood samples were taken at 3 months and 18 months following the initial visit and were processed to obtain Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plasma and RNA which were cryopreserved until required. Subjects were included if they were &#x0003e;18 years of age and were HIV-1 sero-negative. Ethical approval was obtained from the Gambia Government/Medical Research Council joint ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study group definitions</title><p>All contacts with symptoms consistent with TB, that commenced at least 3 months after their respective index case was diagnosed, were considered to be possible secondary TB cases (termed progressor throughout this paper). A TB diagnosis was based on chest x-ray and positive sputum smear and culture results, and/or their response to TB treatment. Randomly chosen non-progressors were age and sex-matched to the progressors and were diagnosed as definitely not having TB for the whole follow-up period. Non-progressors were selected from different household as the progressors to reduce effects of clustering.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>PBMC thawing and flow cytometry</title><p>PBMC were removed from liquid nitrogen and semi-thawed in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath. They were then quickly resuspended in cold RPMI&#x0002b;10&#x00025;FCS and centrifuged (1500 rpm, 5 min), followed by a second wash to remove residual DMSO. Cells were then resuspended in RPMI&#x0002b;10&#x00025; FCS and counted. For flow cytometry staining, at least 200,000 cells were used per test. After carefully removing the supernatant, 20 &#x000b5;L of previously titrated antibody cocktail was added to each tube and vortexed. Cells were then incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min, followed by a wash with cold PBS/FCS/Azide buffer. Supernatant was removed and cells resuspended in 1&#x00025; paraformaldehyde for flow cytometry acquisition. Antibodies used were CD4-PerCP, CD8-Pacific Blue, CD27-APC, CD45RO-PE, CD56-PE, CD56-PECy7 (all from BDPharmingen, USA); CD3-PE-Cy7, CD19-APCAlexa750 (all from eBioscience, UK) and V&#x003b1;24-FITC and V&#x003b2;11-PE (Beckman Coulter, USA). All samples were acquired with a 9-colour (11-parameter) CyAn ADP&#x02122; flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). Prior to acquisition, calibration and compensation were performed and lymphocytes gated according to 90&#x000b0; forward and side scatter plots. FACS plots were analysed using FlowJo software (Treestar, OR), version 6.1.1.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Multiplex cytokine analysis of plasma samples</title><p>Plasma samples from TB cases, non-progressors and progressors at recruitment, 3 months and 18 month time-points were analysed using a Bio-Rad custom made 7-plex kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokines assessed were: IL-10, IL-12(p40), IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;. Following pre-wetting of the filter plate, 50 &#x000b5;l of bead suspension was added to each well and washed twice. 50 &#x000b5;l of samples and standards were then added, the plate was sealed and shaken for 30 sec at 1100 rpm, and incubated for 1 hr at 300 rpm. The plate was washed 3 times then 25 &#x000b5;l of pre-diluted detection antibody was added. Following shaking, the plate was incubated for 30 min. at 300 rpm in the dark. After washing, 50 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x000d7; streptavidin-PE was added to each well and incubated for 10 min. The plate was again washed and resuspended in 125 &#x000b5;l of assay buffer, sealed, mixed and immediately read on the Bioplex analyser using Bioplex manager software (version 4.0; Bio-Rad, USA) and a low PMT setting. All standards were run in duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Dual-colour Reverse Transcription Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (RT-MLPA)</title><p>RNA was isolated at MRC Unit, The Gambia from peripheral blood using Paxgene tubes and extraction kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) and shipped to Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC).

Briefly, 100&#x02013;150 ng RNA was reverse transcribed using gene-specific RT primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase. This was denatured and hybridized overnight at 60&#x000b0;C with a SALSA probe mix (MRC Holland, The Netherlands). After treating the samples with ligase-65 (MRC-Holland, The Netherlands) for 15 min at 54&#x000b0;C, PCR amplification was performed with specific SALSA FAM- or HEX-labelled MAPH primers (2 &#x000b5;M each, forward primer <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGCCGCGGGAATTCGATT-3&#x02032;</named-content> and reverse primer <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCCGCGAATTCACTAGTG-3&#x02032;</named-content>), 13.75 &#x000b5;L H<sub>2</sub>0 and 0.25 &#x000b5;L SALSA polymerase <xref rid="pone.0025230-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

PCR products were then diluted 1&#x02236;10 in HiDi formamide containing 400 HD ROX size standards and analysed on an ABI PRISM 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, UK). Data were analysed using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, UK) and peak areas were exported to a Microsoft Excel file. Sample-related and peak-related differences in PCR and electrophoresis efficiency were corrected by adjusting to GAPDH housekeeping gene. Signals below the threshold value for noise cut-off (peak area &#x02264;200) were adjusted accordingly. A positive control that encompassed the combined target-specific sequences of the left and right hand half-probes was used for all runs.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>For Hematological, Immunophenotyping and Luminex analyses, group medians and distributions were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test comparison. For RT-MLPA analysis a Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. To avoid the assumption of constant variance within groups, robust variance estimates were used. Analyses were performed using STATA version 9.1 (Stata Corporation, USA) and Matlab version 7.6 (Mathworks, Natwick, 2008).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Subject information</title><p>We analysed 22 confirmed TB progressors. These had PBMC and/or RNA and/or plasma samples available but not all sample types were available for all subjects at all time-points. Of the progressors, 14 had viable PBMCs stored at recruitment, 9 at 3 months and 9 at 18 months. These were matched with 31 non-progressors at recruitment, 35 non-progressors at 3 months and 22 non-progressors at 18 months. For cytokine levels within plasma samples, 13 progressors were analysed at each time-point and compared to 21 non-progressors. For RT-MLPA analysis, 12 progressors and 31 non-progressors were analysed. The median[IQR] age of the confirmed progressors was 25[20&#x02013;45] with 58&#x00025; males. The non-progressors were age and sex matched. To try and correct for the variation in the time taken to progress to active disease (median[IQR] of 507[187&#x02013;714] days), we performed analyses based on early (progression between 90&#x02013;507 days) versus late (progression &#x0003e;507 days) progressors where possible (indicated).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Comparison of hematological parameters between progressors and non-progressors</title><p>There were no significant differences between progressors and non-progressors at any time-point for any of the hematological parameters analysed (WBC, Hemoglobin, MCV and platelets) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025230-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025230-t001">Table 1</xref>).

However, no differences in T regulatory (CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;CD127<sup>lo</sup>) cell frequency was observed, indicating that the CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; cells were most likely activated T cells. While we saw a trend towards a higher proportion of CD45RO&#x0002b;CD27&#x0002b; (central memory) and lower levels of CD45RO&#x02212;CD27&#x02212; (terminal effector) cells in both the CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; subsets for progressors, these were not significantly different from non-progressors at any time-point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025230-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, we did see a significant decrease in the proportion of terminal effector cells within the CD4&#x0002b; subset at 3 and 18 months compared to the recruitment time-point for the progressors (p&#x0003c;0.05 for both; data not shown). The only other subset that showed a difference between recruitment and 18 month time-points for the progressors were CD4&#x0002b;CD127&#x0002b; cells (&#x00025;) which were significantly higher at 18 months (p&#x0003c;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025230-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). We also compared early to late progressors at the recruitment time-point and found that CD4&#x0002b; T cells were significantly lower in EP compared to LP (median[IQR]&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19[11&#x02013;32] and 24[18&#x02013;42] respectively; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.029; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025230-t001">Table 1</xref>) and also compared to the non-progressors (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002).

The lower proportion of NKT cells from progressors at the recruitment time-point was also due to a significant difference between non-progressors and the early progressors (median[IQR]&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.09[0.05&#x02013;0.33] and 0.08[0.05&#x02013;0.13] respectively; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.011; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025230-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0025230-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0025230.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Percentage of T, B and NK cells in progressors and non-progressors.</title><p>Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and analysed.

The major differences between progressors and non-progressors included a significantly lower percentage of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and NKT cells but significantly higher percentage of CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; cells in progressors at recruitment. We also found significantly higher plasma IL-18 levels and higher CCR7 but lower Bcl2 gene expression in progressors compared to non-progressors. These differences were generally due to early progressors: the immune system of non-progressors and late progressors was comparable at the recruitment time-point, whilst subjects who progressed between 90&#x02013;507 days following recruitment showed the most immunological differences to non-progressors.</p><p>While we found significant differences at the hematological, lymphocyte, plasma and RNA levels, our analyses also raised many limitations which can only be addressed in a much larger cohort study such as the Gates Grand Challenge for TB <xref rid="pone.0025230-Kaufmann1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Firstly, the number of progressors used in this study was small. While this could be overcome in part by increasing the number of non-progressor samples we analysed, it could not overcome the fact that we had such variability in progression time. Secondly, the interval between the 3 month and 18 month sample collection time points did not facilitate a precise analysis of the changes in the immune system prior to progression to active disease; which is highlighted by the fact that the early-progressors showed the most differences to the non-progressors. Future work should allow for increased time-points of sample collection to ensure the immune responses are captured at the closest possible time-point to progression.</p><p>Despite these difficulties, there were several parameters that showed differences between progressors and non-progressors and should be further validated as potential biomarkers for protective immunity to TB. Interestingly differences were observed in both the innate and the adaptive immune systems, reinforcing the requirements for triggering the innate immune response (through use of adjuvants) in the design of new and improved vaccines <xref rid="pone.0025230-Pashine1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. At the RNA level, we saw the highest fold-difference in BPI and the lowest fold-difference in FCGR1A (CD64) in progressors compared to non-progressors; both of which are expressed by neutrophils and are important in the control of bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0025230-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025230-Jouanguy1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. CD64 is important in the immune response to TB with defects in this gene resulting in increased susceptibility to TB <xref rid="pone.0025230-Jouanguy1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although recent work has shown subjects with active disease to have significantly higher levels of this gene in comparison to latently infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0025230-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. IL-18 is produced by the innate immune system, acts as a precursor to IFN-&#x003b3; production and is highly increased in patients with advanced tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0025230-Sutherland2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025230-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This suggests that the observed increase in plasma IL-18 levels in progressors compared to non-progressors is important in the early stages of the immune response to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. No difference in NK cell proportion was observed at any time-point but a significantly lower proportion of invariant NKT cells were seen in progressors compared to non-progressors. Invariant NKT cells act as a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems and are important in the control of bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0025230-SadaOvalle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025230-Godfrey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, thus a reduction in NKT cell numbers will invariably have downstream effects on the efficacy of the adaptive immune response. The major difference in the adaptive immune system was a significantly lower proportion of CD4&#x0002b; T cells in progressors compared to non-progressors. The crucial role of CD4&#x0002b; T cells in protection against TB disease progression is supported by the profound increase in TB associated with HIV-induced CD4 depletion <xref rid="pone.0025230-Nunn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The decrease in CD4&#x0002b; T cells in progressors may be associated with the decreased levels of the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl2 that we observed. The role of apoptosis in protection against TB disease is complicated as there are differential effects depending on the cell type involved. For instance, induction of apoptosis of infected macrophages is crucial for control of disease <xref rid="pone.0025230-RiosBarrerra1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and is induced by TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0025230-Stenger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is thought this allows removal of infected cells while minimizing tissue destruction in adjacent, uninfected cells <xref rid="pone.0025230-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Conversely, apoptosis of T cells is detrimental to control of disease progression <xref rid="pone.0025230-RiosBarrerra1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, further studies should separate cells into monocytes and lymphocyte subsets in order to identify which cells are affected by the reduced Bcl2 expression. Indeed, a recent study which separated lymphocytes from monocytes prior to RT-MLPA, showed differential levels of Bcl2 in patients with sepsis compared to controls in the lymphocyte but not monocyte populations <xref rid="pone.0025230-Hoogerwerf1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides the basis for further exploration of protective immunity to TB using a case-contact study platform and nested case-control study. Our findings suggest that several markers may predict the onset of active TB in exposed asymptomatic household contacts. These markers, once validated in a larger cohort study, may help to prospectively identify patients at risk of developing active TB as well as demonstrating natural protective immune requirements for the next generation of TB vaccines. Once these markers have been validated in larger studies, they provide avenues to prospectively identify people at risk of developing TB, a key issue in the testing of new TB vaccines <xref rid="pone.0025230-Kaufmann2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec>
