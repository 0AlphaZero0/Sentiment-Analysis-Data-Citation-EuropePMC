<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the intracellular bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), remains a major health threat. Frequently infection remains latent with a 10&#x00025; lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment are inadequate, and despite the use of Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) as vaccine to prevent TB, its efficacy and application practices varies worldwide <xref rid="pone.0026938-Zwerling1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Global gene transcript profiling in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) has evolved into a state-of-the-art measure of the status of the immune system in health and disease (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0026938-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Immune cells patrol the human macroorganism and circulate through blood and lymph to relocate to different tissue sites in the body. During infection, alterations of immune processes in the infected tissue lead to changes in the transcriptional profiles of circulating immune cells.

Signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) of the top 1,000 most differentially expressed genes between TB and LTBI revealed an unexpected enrichment of genes that are involved in SLE. This systemic autoimmune disease is characterized by deposition of immune complexes (IC) and a gene expression profile of elevated type I IFN signaling <xref rid="pone.0026938-Obermoser1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026938-Kyogoku1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> similar to what was observed in TB (this study and <xref rid="pone.0026938-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026938-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>). The causes of this elevated type I IFN expression in SLE are likely deposition of ICs triggering IFN&#x003b1; production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells through Fc gamma receptors <xref rid="pone.0026938-Kyogoku1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Elevated levels of IC accompanied by defective IC solubilization has also been documented in serum of TB patients <xref rid="pone.0026938-Senbagavalli1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and may account, at least in part, for the similarities in gene signatures observed in both diseases. Reduced solubilization of IC also has a well-known pathological manifestation in leprosy, notably during malignant stages <xref rid="pone.0026938-Ramanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which is caused by the mycobacterial pathogen <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The observed increased expression of TLRs as described here, as key molecules in type I IFN signaling, likely further contributes to the IFN-inducible gene signature observed in both SLE and TB.</p><p>In the cohort from The Gambia described herein, the gene <italic>FCGR1</italic> evolved as one of the strongest differentially expressed genes between TB and LTBI, with the highest discriminative power between the two groups. This is in accordance with our previous observations in other cohorts, namely from Europe and South Africa <xref rid="pone.0026938-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026938-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

An intriguing example for this variation is the identification of two patients in the cohort described herein, which displayed an expression signature that closely resembled that of healthy individuals. Expression levels of correlating genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026938-g004">figure 4</xref> and a heatmap provided as supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026938.s002">Figure S2</xref>) illustrate these &#x0201c;outliers&#x0201d;. Although we cannot formally exclude that the two outlier TB patients in this study were diseased from non-tuberculous mycobacteria, from a clinical perspective this is unlikely in a cohort of HIV-negative individuals, where non-tuberculous disease cases are uncommon. Previous studies have speculated about outliers within the LTBI group with a signature indicative of active TB as sub-clinical active cases <xref rid="pone.0026938-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> or individuals progressing to active TB before the onset of clinical symptoms <xref rid="pone.0026938-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Our findings revealing outliers in the active TB group with a signature characteristic of the healthy groups emphasize the occurrence of outliers as a general phenomenon in all groups and hence caution is advised on speculating about their prognostic value before definite proof has been obtained. Reliable interpretation will depend on data from longitudinal follow-up studies such as LTBI who progress into active TB disease as well as of cured TB patients with or without relapses.</p><p>When analyzing group-wise comparisons, variations amongst individual group members can obscure disease-related markers and profiles, which prompted us to embark on further analyses of correlations in gene expression among individuals of the different groups. Taking <italic>FCGR1</italic> as the starting point for these analyses, a large group of genes was identified that revealed both positive and negative correlations with <italic>FCGR1</italic> expression. In part, these correlations also reflect differences in cell type compositions between subjects, which inherently contribute to inter-individual variation. Biological association analysis of 200 genes with the highest expression correlation (both positive and negative) revealed a network of highly interrelated gene products. Three genes within this functional network had a very poor significance value (q&#x0003e;0.1) in a group-wise comparison between TB and LTBI, underlining the power of analyzing gene expression correlations and the potential risk of dismissing relevant genes due to biological variation within groups. Functional annotation analysis of the genes in this network indicated strong association with immune inflammatory responses, apoptosis, responses to bacterial molecular patterns and the NF-kappa B cascade.
