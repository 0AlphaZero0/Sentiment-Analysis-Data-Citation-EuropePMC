Here, mononuclear cell infiltrates in the central nervous system are associated with myelin and axonal destruction <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Iwasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The sequence and nature of the events that lead to the observed neuronal damage in HAM/TSP are not known and because of the lack of a suitable animal model a direct investigation of pathogenic mechanisms is not possible. Thus, clinical management of HAM/TSP is unsatisfactory and current treatment remains only palliative.</p><p>To date, the strongest correlate of risk of HAM/TSP remains a high HTLV-1 proviral load <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Nagai2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, i.e. the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that carry the provirus. The proviral load can differ among individuals by 1000-fold; the mean proviral load is &#x0223c;15-fold higher in patients with HAM/TSP than in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Nagai2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, a significant proportion of infected individuals who present with high HTLV-1 proviral loads never develop the inflammatory disease, suggesting that additional factors contribute to the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP.</p><p>Although other risk factors have been proposed, few differ systematically between ACs and patients with HAM/TSP after normalisation for proviral load: the frequency of certain lymphocyte subsets (HTLV-1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Goon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Toulza1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; natural killer (NK) cells <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>); the level of expression of HTLV-1 genes <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Yamano1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the pattern of integration of the HTLV-1 provirus in the host cell genome <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Meekings1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the contribution of each of these factors to the pathology of HAM/TSP is not known.</p><p>Blood transcriptional profiles have revealed previously unsuspected pathways of pathogenesis in autoimmune and infectious diseases <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Pascual1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Exposure to host or pathogen-derived immunogenic factors trigger changes in gene expression in peripheral blood leukocyte populations that reflect the host immune response mounted against pathogens as well as pathologic conditions of the immune system <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Ramilo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, patient blood samples provide an easily accessible source of immunophenotypic information and are of particular value in HTLV-1 infection, in which CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells constitute the major viral reservoir <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Previous studies on gene expression in HTLV-1 infection have focused on specific cell subpopulations (HTLV-1-infected cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells) <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Oliere1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002480-Refaat1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, whole blood studies integrate gene expression profiles of all leukocytes. Thus, the resulting transcriptional profiles provide a comprehensive overview of the status of the immune system and associated pathological changes.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to identify the principal biological pathways and cell types that are deregulated in HTLV-1 infection and HAM/TSP by quantifying and analyzing differences in blood gene expression patterns of HTLV-1-infected individuals and seronegative controls. Unexpectedly, although the class I-restricted T cell response plays a pivotal role in controlling viral replication and risk of disease <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Bangham2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Jeffery1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the outstanding differences in the transcriptional patterns lay in IFN-stimulated genes. We found that over-expression of a distinct subset of IFN-stimulated genes &#x02013; a &#x02018;transcriptional signature&#x02019; &#x02013; was associated with presence of the inflammatory disease and positively correlated with clinical severity of HAM/TSP. This IFN-inducible transcriptional signature was absent in patients with multiple sclerosis, suggesting distinct pathogenetic pathways in the two diseases despite their clinical similarities. We conclude that IFNs do not efficiently control chronic HTLV-1 infection but may instead contribute to HAM/TSP pathogenesis. Our results identify IFN signaling as a key factor and a novel therapeutic target in HAM/TSP.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The blood transcriptional signature of HTLV-1 infection</title><p>Gene expression profiles were generated from blood samples taken from patients with HAM/TSP, ACs and HTLV-1-seronegative individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002480.s010">Table S1</xref> A).

The IFN-inducible signature was absent in healthy HTLV-1 carriers and correlated positively with the clinical severity of the inflammatory disease. Gene expression signatures may reflect either differences in the frequencies of specific cell populations or a difference in gene expression at the single-cell level. We observed no significant differences in the frequencies of the blood cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002480.s004">Figure S4</xref>): we conclude that the observed IFN-inducible signature resulted from a difference in the intensity of expression of IFN-stimulated genes at the single-cell level.</p><p>Expression of IFN-stimulated genes was evident in neutrophils and monocytes, but not in T cells, which are the cellular reservoir of HTLV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002480-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is therefore likely that the HAM/TSP-specific transcriptional profile originated from exposure to IFNs <italic>in vivo</italic> rather than direct activation of the IFN-response pathway in infected cells. The IFN-stimulated genes identified in HAM/TSP can be induced by both type I and type II IFNs <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Samarajiwa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and we did not detect abnormal plasma levels of type I or type II IFNs in patients with HAM/TSP, perhaps because of their short half-lives in blood <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients with HAM/TSP produced high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; in response to a non-specific stimulus <italic>ex vivo</italic>, which may reflect higher local production of IFN-&#x003b3; <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>IFN-stimulated genes have been shown to mediate potent antiviral and neuroprotective effects <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, several recent studies have implicated IFNs in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="ppat.1002480-vanderPouwKraan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, systemic lupus erythematosus <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Baechler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, systemic sclerosis <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Assassi1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Emamian1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that IFNs trigger autoimmunity by promoting the activation and survival of autoreactive T and B cells in genetically predisposed individuals <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Conrad1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, there is little evidence for antigen-specific autoreactivity in HAM/TSP <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Levin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>; instead, the risk of disease is linked to high frequencies of poor quality antiviral cytotoxic T cells <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Kattan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>; i.e. low avidity of HTLV-1 antigen recognition and reduced lytic efficiency. IFNs may contribute to immunopathological processes in the central nervous system by stimulating and propagating a detrimental immune response to HTLV-1; however, the precise pathways responsible have yet to be determined.</p><p>Despite similarities in clinical presentation the gene expression profiles of HAM/TSP and multiple sclerosis were distinct. The IFN-inducible signature present in HAM/TSP was absent in multiple sclerosis, suggesting that different pathogenetic mechanisms contribute to the axonal damage observed in both diseases. A recent study reported the expression of a subset of type I IFN-stimulated genes in 50&#x00025; of patients with a particular clinical subtype of multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting) <xref rid="ppat.1002480-vanBaarsen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, in agreement with our findings there was little overlap between the IFN-stimulated genes identified in HAM/TSP and the genes whose expression was altered in multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, we found that different subsets of IFN-stimulated genes are actively expressed in other diseases with IFN-inducible signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002480.s003">Figure S3</xref>). There are more than 300 known IFN-stimulated genes, the individual actions of many of which are largely uncharacterized. Thus, it is conceivable that there are cell-type-, pathogen- and disease-specific patterns of IFN-stimulated gene expression that contribute to a beneficial or detrimental outcome of immunological processes.</p><p>Type I IFN therapy is effective in controlling certain persistent viral infections <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Pearlman1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, and there is evidence that it can slow down disease progression in multiple sclerosis <xref rid="ppat.1002480-DhibJalbut1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, clinical trials assessing the benefit of IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; therapy in the treatment of HAM/TSP have been less successful <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>; few patients showed any improvement and the overall clinical benefit was limited. Although a beneficial net effect of systemically administered IFN cannot be excluded, two findings in the present study support the clinical observation that IFNs do not effectively control HTLV-1 infection: (i) over-expression of IFN-stimulated genes was not observed in healthy HTLV-1 carriers who efficiently control the infection; (ii) while IFN-&#x003b1; reduced the expression of the structural viral protein Gag as reported previously <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Kinpara1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, we found that IFN treatment did not affect the expression of the viral transactivator protein Tax or HBZ mRNA. HTLV-1 Tax is essential to the viral life cycle as it has been shown to drive viral replication, promote host cell proliferation and viral cell-to-cell spread <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Grassmann1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. HBZ has been shown to down-modulate Tax function <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Basbous1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> whilst promoting infectivity and viral persistence <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. A recent study has linked elevated HBZ mRNA levels to increased clinical severity of HAM/TSP <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. We found that IFN treatment increased HBZ expression but this observation did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that although type I IFN treatment may decrease the production of viral structural complexes, i.e. capsids, it does not completely abrogate viral activity and proliferation of infected cells. In addition, HTLV-1 viral proteins have been reported to manipulate and evade the IFN response by suppressing interferon regulatory factors and up-regulating suppressors of IFN signaling <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Oliere1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Charoenthongtrakul1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Perturbations of the p53 signaling pathway were evident in all HTLV-1 infected individuals, irrespective of disease status. The p53 signaling pathway prevents cell proliferation of genomically unstable cells by promoting cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Meek1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Altered p53 signaling could reflect a highly active immune response with rapid cell turnover and clonal expansion. However, abnormal p53 signaling has been implicated in HTLV-1-mediated leukemogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Grassmann1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The p53 protein itself is usually intact in HTLV-1 leukemic cells, but there is evidence that the virus inhibits p53-induced anti-viral responses by targeting other components of the p53 signaling pathway <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Boxus1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Akagi1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that HTLV-1-positivity was associated with low mRNA levels of molecules involved in the detection of DNA damage, i.e. the ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC). The protein products of these genes sense dsDNA breaks due to viral integration into the cell's genome and induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis <xref rid="ppat.1002480-Chandhasin1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Decreased expression of ATM and PRKDC could therefore facilitate the survival of genomically unstable HTLV-1-infected cells and allow premature DNA replication in the presence of genomic lesions, thus contributing to the oncogenic potential of HTLV-1.</p><p>In summary, our study revealed that over-expression of a specific subset of IFN-stimulated genes distinguishes patients with HAM/TSP from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers, which indicates an unexpected role of IFN-stimulated genes in the pathogenesis of central nervous system inflammation in HTLV-1 infection. This finding opens new avenues for research on HAM/TSP pathogenesis and new areas of therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All study participants have given written informed consent.
