<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is estimated to infect one-third of the world's population and is one of the most common causes of death by infectious diseases <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Infection by this bacterium mainly results in pulmonary disease, specifically the formation of granulomas, which are intended to wall-off the resistant bacteria. Initially, the granulomas consist of a center of infected macrophages surrounded by a mass of recruited monocytes and neutrophils. After lymphocytes arrive and acquired immunity develops, the granulomas attain delineated peripheral structures <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Russell2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although the exact mechanisms of granuloma development underlying early immune responses have not been fully elucidated, it is believed that the local interaction of bacteria and host immune cells promotes local inflammation toward granuloma formation.</p><p>Diverse bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are thought to be involved in Mtb pathogenesis. Of the Mtb glycolipid cell wall components, trehalose 6,6&#x02032;-dimycolate (TDM) is the most abundant lipid produced by virulent Mtb. TDM possesses immunostimulatory properties, including granulomagenesis and adjuvant activity for cell-mediated and humoral immune responses <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Hunter2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In mice, purified TDM causes immunopathologies, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the formation of granulomas similar to those observed during Mtb infections <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Perez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus, how TDM induces inflammatory responses upon Mtb infection is a key question that must be addressed.</p><p>Cells of the innate immune system detect PAMPs through germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Janeway1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Currently, four different classes of PRRs have been identified: (1) Toll-like receptors (TLRs), (2) RIG-I like receptors, (3) Nod-like receptors, and (4) C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). Among the PRRs, CLRs compose the largest family of cell-surface molecules with a carbohydrate-recognition domain <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recently, Mincle (Clec4e, Clecsf9), belonging to the CLR family, was found to recognize TDM, as well as a synthetic derivative, trehalose 6,6-dibehenate <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Schoenen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Mincle also recognizes various pathogens, such as <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>Malasezzia spp.</italic>, <italic>F. pedrosoi</italic>, and an endogenous ligand, SAP130, from dead cells <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002614-Yamasaki2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In macrophages, activated Mincle selectively associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing Fc receptor common &#x003b3;-chain (FcR&#x003b3;). The Mincle-FcR&#x003b3; complex activates Syk kinase through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. This signaling event leads to heterotypic aggregation of Card9 with the adaptor protein Bcl10 and paracaspase Malt1, triggering the production of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Yamasaki2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Werninghaus1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, TDM-activated macrophages can induce cytokine/chemokine production, which can trigger robust recruitment and activation of inflammatory effector cells leading to pulmonary granuloma formation <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Welsh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, the activation of the Mincle signaling pathway in macrophages may be a key event in granuloma formation.</p><p>However, during mycobacterial infections, neutrophils and other immune cells are also augmented in the infected lung. Neutrophils become the predominant cell type infected by rapidly-replicating intracellular Mtb in patients with tuberculosis, which results in the over-activation of IFN&#x003b3; and type-I IFN <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Eum1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Human neutrophils stimulated by Mtb produce several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8, and MIP-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Aleman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Kasahara1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These results indicate that neutrophils, in addition to macrophages, can initiate a key effector response to Mtb. However, the mechanisms by which neutrophils regulate the initial stage of mycobacterial infections are not fully understood.</p><p>To understand the inflammatory responses of the initial phase of mycobacterial infections, we explored the role of Mincle signaling on neutrophils during TDM-induced lung inflammation and the subsequent immune responses. We demonstrated that neutrophils were recruited during the initial phase of TDM-induced inflammation in a Mincle-dependent manner. TDM-induced Mincle signaling on neutrophils resulted in surface expression of the CD11b/CD18 integrin, thereby augmenting neutrophil adhesion. TDM-induced Mincle signaling was dependent on Src, Syk, MAPK/ERK kinases (MEK), and MAPK. Moreover, coactivation of the Mincle and TLR2 pathways caused neutrophils to be in a highly-activated state through the induction of robust inflammatory responses, including high CD11b/CD18 surface expression, adhesion, ROS production, and TNF&#x003b1; production. The physiological relevance of the TDM-induced immune response was confirmed by the requirement of Mincle for efficient eradication of Mtb upon aerosol infection and by the defects of the neutrophil-depleted mice in the production of key cytokines/chemokines during TDM-induced inflammation. These results indicate that the Mincle pathway in neutrophils plays an important role in mycobacterial TDM-induced lung inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Neutrophils were actively recruited to lung tissue during the initial stage of a TDM-induced granuloma model</title><p>A single dose of TDM in mice results in the development of lung granulomas that peak in number and size after 7 days and slowly resolve afterward <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Perez2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

The number of neutrophils (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Ly6G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) was elevated on day 2 post-TDM administration, and was maintained through day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The numbers of monocytes and macrophages (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Ly6G<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) were abruptly increased on day 5 after challenge. B-cell (CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and T-cell (CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) numbers were not altered throughout the observed period. To confirm the abundance of recruited immune cells, lung sections were analyzed using immunohistochemistry with neutrophil (Ly6G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and mature macrophage (F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Ly6G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neutrophils accumulated around blood vessels on the day after TDM administration, and were maintained in WT mice. Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lungs did not contain recruited cells at any point. However, the number of F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, which represent the resident alveolar macrophages, remained constant during granuloma development in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, F4/80), even though a vast number of monocytes (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Ly6G<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) infiltrated the lung on day 5 after TDM challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lung tissues did not indicate increased levels of F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. These results suggest that two major types of effector cells, neutrophils and monocytes, are involved in the TDM-induced inflammation that leads to granuloma formation, and that neutrophils react immediately to TDM prior to monocytes.</p><p>To examine the physiological changes associated with immune cell recruitment, we measured the transcript levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines during TDM-induced lung inflammation in WT and Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In WT mice, IL-6 and MCP-1 expression peaked at day 1, and TNF&#x003b1; expression was elevated for a prolonged period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Although the induction pattern of TNF&#x003b1; assimilated with the recruitment kinetics of monocytes, the early expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 correlated with the recruitment of neutrophils during the initial stage of inflammation. Taken together with the constant level of mature macrophages at infection sites, these results indicate that neutrophils could be the major source of the key inflammatory cytokines produced during the early stage of TDM-induced inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mincle expression on neutrophils was critical for their recruitment to TDM-challenged sites</title><p>Although several current models suggest that neutrophils are recruited to infection sites by chemokines released from activated macrophages, the concurrent recruitment of neutrophils with the immediate release of the key inflammatory cytokines suggests direct recruitment of neutrophils by TDM, possibly through recognition by Mincle.

When we examined Mincle expression in neutrophils, Mincle mRNA was induced rapidly by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

Subcutaneous insertion of TDM-coated beads induced a strong neutrophil recruitment around the inoculated beads within 20 h even in the absence of the additionally-supplied BMMs. However, beads containing only activated BMMs failed to recruit neutrophils under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that TDM, not activated resident macrophages, is the major determinant of neutrophil recruitment to the beads.</p><p>To confirm the requirement of Mincle for neutrophil recruitment, we repeated the above experiments in Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the presence and absence of WT BMMs. Contrary to WT mice, Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice inoculated with TDM-coated beads showed no neutrophil recruitment even in the presence of the supplemented WT BMMs. This indicates that Mincle expression by neutrophils is required for neutrophil recruitment to the beads. Although the WT BMMs were dispensable for neutrophil recruitment in the TDM-bead model, the BMMs appeared to enhance the recruitment of neutrophils to the beads in Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In WT mice, beads mixed with WT BMMs induced higher levels of neutrophil recruitment than did beads mixed with Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>). Therefore, it is highly probable that BMMs enhanced the recruitment of neutrophils by releasing TDM-induced chemotactic factors in a Mincle-dependent manner. Under these conditions, the number of macrophages remained similar to that of the initially-inoculated BMMs, suggesting that macrophage recruitment was not affected by genetic backgrounds within 20 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002614-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).

Lung sections prepared from Ly6G mAb-treated mice and control mice challenged with TDM were H&#x00026;E stained. Two days after the TDM treatment, lungs from control mice had higher numbers of foci with accumulated neutrophils and macrophages than did lungs from Ly6G mAb-treated mice.

Although these neutrophil depletion conditions were not sufficient to prevent granuloma formation, the reduction of IL-6 and MCP-1 production during the early stage of TDM-induced lung inflammation indicates that mycobacterial TDM can activate neutrophils to produce key inflammatory factors that contribute to the amplification of acute lung inflammation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report several interesting findings on the role of Mincle signaling on neutrophils during the early stage of mycobacterial TDM-induced inflammation. First, neutrophils were recruited to TDM-challenged sites through Mincle signaling and contributed to the innate immune response by producing proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Second, TDM-induced Mincle signaling promoted neutrophil adhesion by up-regulating CD11b/CD18 surface expression through Src, Syk, and MEK signaling. Third, coactivation of TLR2 potentiated TDM-activated Mincle signaling by up-regulating Mincle surface expression on neutrophils. Fourth, in a murine model, Mincle activity was required for defense against Mtb infection, and the lack of neutrophils during the TDM-induced inflammation caused defects in early immune responses. These properties of Mincle signaling during TDM-induced lung inflammation may provide valuable clues for determining the pathological role of neutrophils during Mtb-induced diseases.</p><p>Mycobacterial cell walls contain diverse PAMPs (such as phosphatidylinositol dimannoside, phosphatidylinositol hexamannoside, and TDM) that can trigger granuloma formation <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Bekierkunst1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002614-Yamagami1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Among these components, TDM is a virulence factor that can mimic the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis, including excessive proinflammatory cytokine production, granulomatous responses, weight loss, and caseous necrosis when administered as a monolayer or part of an oil-in-water emulsion <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Hunter2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Bekierkunst2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002614-Geisel1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. TDM-deprived Mtb remains viable, but fails to induce accelerating infections when injected into mice. Removal of TDM from the surface of mycobacteria reduces their ability to survive in macrophages and in the lungs and spleens of mice <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Indrigo1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002614-Lima1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A loss of virulence is also correlated with a disruption of the ability of Mtb to assemble excess TDM <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Hunter3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Armitige1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Moreover, mutations that alter the structure of mycolic acids on TDM can suppress or increase the virulence of Mtb. For example, a <italic>pcaA</italic> mutant form of Mtb that is unable to modify the cis-cyclopropane of mycolic acid on TDM, has attenuated virulence and invokes less severe immunopathology than WT Mtb <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, a <italic>cmaA2</italic> mutant Mtb that lacks trans-cycloproponation of the mycolic acids on TDM is hypervirulent while inducing larger granulomas than does WT Mtb <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Rao2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Therefore, TDM may be a key driver of Mtb-induced tuberculosis. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of TDM-induced immune responses will provide fundamental clues in the understanding of Mtb-induced pathogenesis. However, TDM-induced lung inflammation delivered through intravenously injection may be different from Mtb infection through aerosol-inhalation because additional ligands of mycobacteria activate diverse immune signals directly on the alveolar cells, and the additional immune evading mechanisms of live mycobacteria can induce complex responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Neutrophils play very important roles in innate immune responses against bacterial infections. However, the role of neutrophils in Mtb infection remains controversial. Pedrosa and colleagues indicated that the absence of neutrophils significantly impaired the defense against the initial stages of mycobacterial infections <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Pedrosa1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Additionally, LPS-induced transient neutrophil recruitment prevents early mycobacterial infections <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Sugawara1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. On the other hand, Seiler and colleagues showed that neutrophils are not involved in the early control of Mtb infections <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Seiler1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Some of these differences may be due to the specificity of the antibodies used for neutrophil depletion or the mycobacteria strains used. Although our neutrophil depletion experiments in mice showed no major defects in granuloma formation, the initiation of immune cell recruitment appears to have been retarded with defects in IL-6 and MCP-1 production. Considering the higher bacterial load in the Mincle-mutant mice and the presence of macrophage-driven granulomas equivalent to those found in WT mice, Mincle&#x02013;mediated immune responses may be required to clear Mtb infections during the initial phase of inflammation. However, the use of neutrophil-specific Mincle knockout mice is needed to confirm the distinct function of neutrophils against Mtb infection.</p><p>Although we demonstrated TDM-Mincle mediated inflammatory responses in neutrophils, Mincle signaling is also activated by endogenous protein, SAP130 from dead cells <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It is known that TDM administration induces necrosis of host cells, and necrotic bodies are indeed existed in the center of granulomas <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Sakamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that both TDM from mycobacterial PAMP and endogenous ligand from dead cells may contribute to induce inflammatory responses through Mincle signaling after TDM administration in vivo.</p><p>In this report, we show that the Mincle downstream molecules Srk, Syk, and MAPK/ERK kinases play a key role in neutrophil adherence to TDM. Our results support and extend previous findings demonstrating that the Mincle signaling pathway produces proinflammatory cytokines via the FcR&#x003b3;-Syk pathway in macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Yamasaki2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. One important difference between macrophages and neutrophils is that neutrophils induce up-regulation of cell-surface CD11b/CD18 in response to TDM. Generally, CD11b/CD18 is not constitutively in its active form. However, when an immune response stimulates neutrophils, the CD11b/CD18 activity is controlled by signaling through immune receptors. This &#x02018;inside-out&#x02019; signaling converts integrins from inactive to active forms <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Abram1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Fc receptors for IgG induce CD11b/CD18 activation via inside-out signaling <xref rid="ppat.1002614-OrtizStern1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, and the up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 by activated Fc&#x003b3;RIIA and Fc&#x003b3;RIIIB is mediated through Src and Syk kinase activation <xref rid="ppat.1002614-OrtizStern2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Kocher1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. These CD11b/CD18 conformational changes result in increased ligand binding affinities and clustering of integrins on the membrane leading to cell attachment. Our work identified that robust neutrophil adherence is also induced by Mincle-mediated inside-out CD11b/CD18 surface expression. Mincle-induced CD11b/CD18 clustering may also affect leukocyte rolling and transmigration on the vascular endothelium to initiate innate immune responses following Mtb infection.</p><p>Although both Mincle and TLR activation induced actin remodeling, these receptors likely mediate different cellular reorganizations. TLR ligation leads to the coordinated redeployment of actin to provide fuel for endocytosis by dendritic cells <xref rid="ppat.1002614-West1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. However, active F-actin polymerization induced by TDM/Mincle signaling promoted cell adhesion by inducing high levels of CD11b/CD18 surface expression. Therefore, Mincle signaling on neutrophils plays a unique role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that is required for cell adhesion.</p><p>Several studies have shown that synergistic proinflammatory cytokine production and TLR (TLR2 and TLR4) signaling is necessary for the coactivation of CLRs, such as Dectin-1 and MICL/DCAL-2 in macrophages and DCs <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Dennehy1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002614-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. In this report, we describe the synergistic interactions between the Mincle and TLR2 signaling pathways in neutrophils. Whereas TDM stimulation resulted in the slow and steady induction of diverse neutrophil responses (CD11b/CD18 surface expression, cell adhesion, ROS release, and TNF&#x003b1; production), co-stimulation with TDM and Pam3CSK4 rapidly and strongly up-regulated these responses. One possible explanation is that the large induction of Mincle by TLR ligands may result in additional TDM signaling. A similar mechanism was used with epithelial cells, and the level of TLR2 on unstimulated epithelial cells was markedly enhanced in response to invading microbes <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Shuto1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Mincle was also up-regulated on macrophages after exposure to various stimuli and cellular stresses, such as LPS, TNF&#x003b1;, and IL-6 <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Our studies confirmed that Mincle expression on neutrophil surfaces was highly up-regulated following Pam3CSK4 stimulation. Therefore, the synergistic inflammatory responses of neutrophils likely resulted from the positive enforcement of Mincle expression by TLR activation.</p><p>During the initiation of Mtb-induced granuloma formation, it is thought that TNF&#x003b1; production by infected macrophages drives the recruitment of neutrophils, which in turn produce diverse cytokines and chemokines. Consequently, a large number of lymphocytes are recruited to the site of infection. In murine models of Mtb infection, TNF&#x003b1; is essential for the formation of granulomas <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002614-Bean1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. However, the early recruitment of neutrophils prior to the majority of other cell types and the dramatic induction of immune responses by neutrophils following coactivation of Mincle and TLR2, indicates that neutrophils may be recruited to the site of Mtb infection by direct recognition of TDM. In particular, IL-6 and MCP-1 expressions in infected lung were strongly correlated with the early recruitment of neutrophils. Despite of the strong Mincle-mediated responses of neutrophils at the initiation of inflammation, the redundant function of macrophages appears to be sufficient for the granuloma maturation. Therefore, neutrophils may play a major role in the initiation of immune responses against Mtb infection rather than working in the granuloma formation after being passively recruited by activated immune cells.</p><p>Although serum TNF&#x003b1; levels were also decreased in neutrophil-depleted mice during Mtb infection conditions, lung TNF&#x003b1; expression levels were not significantly affected by the depletion of neutrophils. Contrary to the early expression pattern of IL-6 and MCP-1, TNF&#x003b1; expression was extended for a few more days, thus overlapping with monocyte recruitment to the infection sites, suggesting that monocytes may contribute to TNF&#x003b1; production as well. Therefore, the large number of recruited monocytes may compensate for the loss of TNF&#x003b1; expression caused by neutrophil depletion at the localized infection site.</p><p>In summary, our study provides evidence that the Mincle signaling pathway in neutrophils promotes diverse neutrophil activation responses (cell adherence, CD11b/CD18 surface expression, ROS release, and TNF&#x003b1; production) in response to mycobacterial TDM. These immune responses to Mtb via Mincle signaling were enhanced by coactivation of TLR2. Furthermore, neutrophils produced proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines during the early stage of TDM-induced pulmonary inflammation. These findings suggest that the Mincle pathway in neutrophils is able to modulate lung inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) guidelines.
