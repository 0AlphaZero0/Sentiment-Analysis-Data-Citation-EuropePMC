<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> has emerged as one of the most frequent cause of community-acquired invasive bacterial infections, with significant morbidity and mortality. Just in 2005 in the United States, 18,650 deaths were reported due to methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) <xref rid="pone.0034390-Klevens1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Wallin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Crum1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Vandenesch1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Carleton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Begier1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The spectrum of community-associated (CA) <italic>S. aureus</italic> disease is wide and patients can present with a variety of clinical illness, ranging from mild soft tissue infections to invasive disease such as bacteremia, pneumonia, or osteoarticular infections <xref rid="pone.0034390-Klevens1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Rubinstein1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-VanderHave1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Circulating leukocytes represent an accessible source of molecular information, which can be studied by analyzing the whole blood genome-wide transcriptome.

The neutrophil depletion from PBMC may result in the loss of key information in the systemic characterization of bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0034390-DeLeo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. As new research tools became available we performed whole blood microarray profiling &#x02013;including neutrophils &#x02013; in a new cohort of 99 pediatric patients with <italic>S aureus</italic> infection. Using this large cohort we now defined: a) the common host response to <italic>S aureus</italic> infection; and b) the differences in host response patterns depending on the site of infection and the clinical presentation of the disease. The main objective of this analysis was to determine whether the transcriptional profiles reflect the variation of clinical disease manifestations and to provide new insights in disease pathogenesis by defining the differences in host responses among patients with different clinical presentations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>
<italic>S. aureus</italic> induces a distinct and robust transcriptional signature in whole blood</title><p>To define the whole blood biosignature of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in children, 99 patients and 44 healthy controls were assigned to two independent groups of subjects, to serve as &#x0201c;training&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;test&#x0201d; sets. The training set was used to identify the signature of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. This signature was validated in the independent test set by assessing its capacity to separate the patients from healthy controls by hierarchical clustering. The training set included 40 patients with <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and 22 healthy controls, matched for age, sex and race (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034390-t001">Table 1</xref>). Statistical group comparison yielded 1,422 differentially regulated transcripts. Hierarchical clustering of these transcripts grouped them according to similarities in gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This signature was validated in the independent test set of 59 patients and 22 healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of these 1,422 transcripts grouped 52 out of 59 patients from the test set together. The seven patients who clustered with controls presented with either mild or moderate disease, and were closer to recovery and hospital discharge compared with all other patients.</p><fig id="pone-0034390-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0034390.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection whole blood transcriptional signature is characterized by over-expression of myeloid lineage transcripts and under-expression of lymphoid lineage transcripts.</title><p>

<italic>S. aureus</italic> infection activates innate immunity and suppresses the adaptive immune response</title><p>To better understand the whole blood response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and the immune pathways activated, we used an analytical framework of 62 transcriptional modules that group together genes with shared expression pattern and similar biological function across independent blood transcriptional datasets <xref rid="pone.0034390-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Module maps were derived independently for the training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and test sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), using their respective healthy control group as reference. Patients with acute <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection demonstrated significant over-expression of modules linked to the myeloid lineage (M3.2, M4.6, M4.13, M4.14, M6.6), and inflammation (M4.2, M5.1, M6.13) confirming our earlier findings in PBMC. Furthermore, patients displayed over-expression of modules linked to the coagulation cascade (M1.1), hematopoietic precursors (M3.3 and M5.3), and neutrophils (M5.15). Conversely, they demonstrated significant under-expression of modules linked to T cells (M4.1, M6.15 and M6.19), cytotoxicity/NK cells (M3.6 and M4.15), B cells (M4.10), and lymphoid lineage (M4.7 and M6.9).

To this end, we first calculated the molecular distance to health, or MDTH for each individual patient. The MDTH is a score that measures the global transcriptional perturbation in each patient compared to the median of healthy controls. Thus by summarizing the overall transcriptional activity in one score, the MDTH facilitates the correlation with clinical parameters <xref rid="pone.0034390-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034390-Pankla1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

However, 25 patients had MDTH scores that were within the range of healthy controls MDTH (3&#x02013;259). These patients were flagged as transcriptionally quiescent (TQ) and separated from transcriptionally active patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;74). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 10,972 transcripts expressed in at least one of the 143 subjects grouped these quiescent patients with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Four major transcriptional active patient clusters (C1 to C4) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0034390-Sugar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Group module expression was derived for each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Cluster C1 included 13 patients with a high mean MDTH (3,003) and strong over-expression of myeloid (M3.2, M4.6, M4.13, M6.6) and inflammation (M4.2, M5.1, M6.13) modules. Cluster C2 comprised 31 patients with a signature qualitatively similar to C1, but quantitatively dimmer as supported by the lower mean MDTH (973). Cluster C3 regrouped 12 patients with high MDTH (2,395) and low inflammatory signature, but over-expression of modules linked to erythropoiesis (M2.3, M3.1, M4.4, M6.18) and hematopoiesis (M5.3). C1 and C3 both displayed significant down-regulation of transcripts linked to B and T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Gene level analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) combined with PANTHER <xref rid="pone.0034390-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> ontology ranking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org">http://www.pantherdb.org</ext-link>) supported this observation as heme biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s006">Figure S6B</xref>) and porphyrin metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s006">Figure S6C</xref>) were the most enriched pathways in C3 versus C1.

In addition, we assessed whether the differences observed at the modular level were related to the time of sample collection in relation to the length of stay (draw index). Cluster C1 displayed a lower draw index, indicating that blood samples were collected at an earlier stage of hospitalization. Patients from C1 required a longer duration of hospitalization than other patients. Additionally, patients from C1 had significantly higher CRP, WBC, neutrophil and monocyte counts. Thus, these routine laboratory markers of inflammation corroborated the over-expression of myeloid and inflammatory modules.</p><p>The C3 patients showed decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCHC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s006">Figure S6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s013">Table S5</xref>), suggesting an anemic state that might trigger erythropoiesis as indicated by the signature. The C3 erythropoietic signature overlapped with transcripts from CD71&#x0002b; early erythroid precursors <xref rid="pone.0034390-Hinze1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s006">Figure S6D</xref>).</p><p>Then, we analyzed how infection site, clinical presentation, and type of bacterial strain were distributed among clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034390-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034390.s014">Table S6</xref>). All patients in cluster C1 had invasive or disseminated disease, and a higher proportion of patients with pneumonia.

Both conserved and heterogeneous elements of the transcriptional signature were identified, which correlate with time elapsed since hospitalization, bacterial dissemination, and the type of clinical presentation. Supporting our earlier study on PBMC <xref rid="pone.0034390-Ardura1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the whole blood signature was characterized by significant over-expression of myeloid lineage and inflammation transcripts, and under-expression of lymphoid lineage transcripts. This may reflect the large expansion of circulating neutrophils and monocytes during the acute phase of infection.</p><p>While all patients share a global signature to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, analysis of fingerprints of individual patients revealed heterogeneous elements of the molecular signature. The major transcriptional patterns identified included a pro-inflammatory myeloid signature, linked to sampling early in the course of infection, high neutrophil and monocyte counts, and elevated CRP (C1). Some patients displayed an erythropoiesis fingerprint with limited myeloid components (C3), which likely represents an increased release of hematopoietic precursors from the bone marrow during acute infection <xref rid="pone.0034390-Scumpia1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This erythropoiesis signature was observed in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SOJIA) <xref rid="pone.0034390-Hinze1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and was proposed to reflect the expansion of immature precursor cells and ineffective erythropoiesis. The latter results in accumulation of iron in tissues <xref rid="pone.0034390-Tanno1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which supports bacterial survival. It was suggested that erythropoietin (EPO) inhibits NF-kB and TNFa-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways <xref rid="pone.0034390-Nairz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which could explain why C3 patients displayed limited pro-inflammatory signature. This could represent a bacterial survival mechanism, whereby increased erythropoiesis would prevent the development of an adequate pro-inflammatory response and subsequent bacterial clearance. Despite increased numbers of neutrophils, we did not detect consistent changes in transcripts linked to the interferon response, as previously observed in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0034390-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Fifteen out of 99 patients displayed over-expression of the three IFN modules but tested negative for concomitant viral infections. It may reflect IFN activation to counter arrest the bacteria-induced pro-inflammatory milieu <xref rid="pone.0034390-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in the later stages of infection.</p><p>Currently, there are no established laboratory markers that either objectively define the extent of clinical disease severity in patients with <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections or monitor the spread of the infection to multiple organs <xref rid="pone.0034390-VanderHave1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Transcriptional profiling highlighted global quantitative differences between patients with local or disseminated disease, supporting the value of microarrays and the quantitative MDTH genomic score to monitor the spread of infection.</p><p>Additionally, the signatures provided unique transcriptional information on the pathogenesis of different clinical syndromes. Patients with osteoarticular infections displayed over-expression of transcripts linked to blood coagulation, a finding possibly related with the increased systemic coagulation and deep venous thrombosis observed in patients with musculoskeletal infections <xref rid="pone.0034390-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Additionally, patients with pneumonia displayed over-expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, which might be involved in neutrophil recruitment to the lung <xref rid="pone.0034390-Balamayooran1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Importantly, the location and extent of disease dissemination impacted transcriptional profiles to a greater extent than molecular characteristics of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. This suggests that either: 1) the early innate response is directed towards features of <italic>S. aureus</italic> conserved across strains; 2) the human response is specifically tailored to the infection site; 3) staphylococcal gene expression differs based on the site of disease.</p><p>Despite the qualitative variability of the host response, the intensity of the signature decreases as patients get closer to discharge, regardless of the localization of the infection or the type of clinical presentation, suggesting that this assay has potential to monitor the clinical course of infection. Future studies should focus on the diagnostic and prognostic value of this approach in identifying patients at risk for infection dissemination and eventually determine its value in guiding therapeutic decisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
