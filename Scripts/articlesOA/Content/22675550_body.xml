<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) causes most cases of tuberculosis (TB) in humans, claiming over 1.5 million lives every year. <italic>Mtb</italic> isolates are more genetically diverse than previously thought, and most interestingly, such <italic>Mtb</italic> genetic lineages seem to be associated with bio-geographic human populations <xref rid="pone.0038367-Hershberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038367-Dos1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For convenience, <italic>Mtb</italic> lineages are thus named after their geographic origins. One group of such genetically related <italic>Mtb</italic> isolates was first reported from patients mainly from Beijing, China, and hence was named as &#x0201c;Beijing family&#x0201d; of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains <xref rid="pone.0038367-Parwati1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. At the same time period, &#x0201c;W&#x0201d; strains were described in New York City, USA <xref rid="pone.0038367-Bifani1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and exhibited relatedness with strains of the Beijing family <xref rid="pone.0038367-Kurepina1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These two strain families were then collectively named as &#x0201c;W-Beijing&#x0201d;. Since first described, the W-Beijing family has raised increasing concerns globally. Indeed W-Beijing strains of <italic>Mtb</italic> account for up to 50&#x00025; of TB cases in East-Asia (nearly 13&#x00025; in the world); moreover, several lines of evidences have pointed to their higher virulence, as compared to other strains, in various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models <xref rid="pone.0038367-Parwati1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For instance, strains of the W-Beijing family resulted in more bacilli in the lung and earlier mortality of experimentally infected mice, as compared with strains from other families including Somali, Haarlem, Canetti, and the laboratory stain H37Rv <xref rid="pone.0038367-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, as well as in higher bacilli load in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, and more severe clinical manifestations in rabbit model of tuberculosis meningitis, as compared to the clinical strain CDC1551 <xref rid="pone.0038367-Tsenova1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Other studies have shown that strains of the W-Beijing family induced less protective cytokines but more cell necrosis in the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-treated macrophage-like THP-1 cells, as compared to H37Rv <xref rid="pone.0038367-Sohn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Gan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Here we aimed at exploring host macrophage response to <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing on a genome-wide scale using gene expression profiling. Transcriptome profiling has been widely used to gain insights into host-mycobacteria interactions in various contexts <xref rid="pone.0038367-Schnappinger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this study, we used the human macrophage-like THP-1 cell line as a model of innate immune cell because it allows to minimize the influence of host heterogeneity as compared to human blood donor-derived primary macrophages <xref rid="pone.0038367-Tailleux1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition to the reference laboratory strain H37Rv, a total of eleven <italic>Mtb</italic> strains representing six sublineages of the W-Beijing family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were used to infect host cells, and were subsequently profiled using whole-genome expression arrays. Through detailed data mining, we found transcriptome responses of the host were largely similar, irrespective of the <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing subgroups tested, although it could not be excluded that there were minor differences between different strains. Accordingly, a core response gene signature was recognized (THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature). Based on this gene signature and cross-study comparisons, we were able to identify several putative immunity-related, and more particularly interferon-related, transcription factors that might regulate the core host transcriptional response. We were also able to show the clinical relevance of such core responses with those observed in active pulmonary tuberculosis patients <xref rid="pone.0038367-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which appears to be tuberculosis specific when compared to patients from other inflammatory diseases and pathological conditions <xref rid="pone.0038367-Ramilo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

However, it remains unknown how host cells cope with the heterogeneity of these SNPs-genotyped strains. In an attempt to address this issue, we selected eleven W-Beijing strains from the six most representative sublineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and these strains, in addition to H37Rv, were used to infect THP-1 host cells in a time-series setting. Using whole-genome expression arrays, we performed transcriptome profilings of THP-1 cells infected at three time points including early stage (4 h), intermediate stage (18 h), and late stage (48 h), as well as an uninfected sample (0 h) as a control. After array hybridization and data normalization, Absent-Present based filtering <xref rid="pone.0038367-Tailleux1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> was applied to select the most reliable probesets/transcripts. A total of 18,541 transcripts across the 39 infected samples (3 time points &#x000d7;11 <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing strains, 3 time points &#x000d7;2 duplicated <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv strain, compared to the uninfected THP-1 cells as a control) remained and were subsequently used for unsupervised sample classifications. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s001">Figure S1</xref>, samples were unambiguously classified into three groups, exactly corresponding to the infection time points, and independently of the strain genotype (<italic>i.e.</italic> H37Rv <italic>vs</italic>. W-Beijing, and among W-Beijing sublineages). When component plane presentations integrated self-organizing map (CPP-SOM) <xref rid="pone.0038367-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> were used to illustrate sample-specific transcriptome map, host cells infected by strains of different genotypes appeared to share similar global expression changes at each of all three infection time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; see also pair-wise correlation coefficients in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, the major changes were observed at the interval between 4 h and 18 h of infection, while little changes occurred thereafter. These observations suggested that host transcriptome responses do not rely on the genotype (<italic>i.e.</italic> sublineage) of the W-Beijing strains tested. To evaluate the possibility of whether the genetic diversity of the strains could instead be explained by function-specific differences in host cells, we also performed the sample classifications with the same parameters to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figure 2A</xref> but using genes only annotated to specific functional categories (i.e., immunity and defense from PANTHER classification system <xref rid="pone.0038367-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Like the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, samples were again grouped together according to the infection duration, irrespective of the genotype of the strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Further restriction using more specific immunity-related processes did not change the sample relationships (data not shown). In all, the host transcriptome responses induced by H37Rv and by different sublineages of <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing strains are predominantly similar, and hardly broad differences as well as immune response-specific differences were detectable, even though we can not guarantee that minor differences would be observed if more biological replicates were involved. Although the small number of strains of each genotype used here may be insufficient to distinguish subtle genotype- and subgenotype-specific host cell responses, our results nevertheless suggested that a transcriptional core response of human macrophages to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection could be extracted from our data.</p><fig id="pone-0038367-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038367.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Transcriptome classification of THP-1 cells to W-Beijing strains as well as the lab strain H37Rv.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample classification of THP-1 transcriptome responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing and H37Rv strains.W-Beijing strains from the same node (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were highlighted by the same color.

It was also appealing to speculate that there might exist a common host transcriptome response signature, reflective of the robust nature of host cellular responses. To validate this speculation, we applied a LIMMA-based methodology <xref rid="pone.0038367-Gentleman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> to identify genes differentially expressed between 4 h and 18 h. These genes were collectively informative as a common THP-1 response to <italic>Mtb</italic> (THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s016">Table S2</xref>). As showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic> could be further divided into two parts: one for the induction at 18 h (and 48 h) as compared with 4 h (THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced), the other for the repression (THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-repressed). Interestingly, as high as 92&#x00025; (367/399) of genes in the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic> are generally induced (i.e., THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced). When enrichment analysis was applied to examine whether they shared functional or regulatory features <xref rid="pone.0038367-Ashburner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> (see below for details), we only observed biological features associated with genes in the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g003">Figures 3B&#x02013;3D</xref>), and in contrast, neither functional terms nor transcription factors were significantly linked to genes in the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-repressed. Since genes in the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-repressed were trivial both in number and functional/regulatory relevance, we only considered the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced group of genes, and the latter was therefore denoted as the common host transcriptome response signature (hereinafter referred to as &#x0201c;THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature&#x0201d;) for the subsequent analysis.</p><fig id="pone-0038367-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038367.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>A common host transcriptome response signature and its biological characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>) between 4 h to 18 h after <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.

Several lines of clues have pointed to their involvement in regulating the immune responses against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. First, literature mining showed that these regulators had been linked to <italic>Mtb</italic> in several studies. Two members of the IRF family, namely IRF-1 and IRF-7, have been reported to be activated in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0038367-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the activation of STAT-1/2 is prerequisite for the induction of IRF-1 and IRF-7 <xref rid="pone.0038367-Remoli1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Oct-1, a member of the POU family proteins containing six classes (POU1 to POU6), was reported to regulate type I interferon transcription <xref rid="pone.0038367-Mesplede1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and was also reported to be induced in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected human monocytes <xref rid="pone.0038367-Ameixa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A recent study showed that Oct-1 may function as an anti-repressive regulator of those genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses when being exposed to oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0038367-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Second, we accordingly observed the induction of <italic>STAT-1/2</italic>, <italic>IRF-1</italic>, <italic>IRF-7</italic>, and <italic>Oct-1</italic> themselves in our host cell model, which could be independently validated by qRT-PCR method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Then, a detailed computational survey allowed us to bridge the potential links between these multiple immune-responsive regulators (i.e., STATs, IRF-1, IRF-7, and Oct-1) and the induction of the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s006">Figure S6</xref>). By looking at the multifaceted TFBS composition in the promoter regions of the genes involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, we found that most of genes harbored at least one of the putative TFBSs of four regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). These regulators might cooperate in an additive/synergistic manner to modulate the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, particularly in the interferon pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0038367-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038367.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>qRT-PCR validation of transcriptional regulators <italic>STAT-1/2</italic>, <italic>IRF-1</italic>, <italic>IRF-7</italic>, and <italic>Oct-1</italic>.</title><p>Data were obtained from four time-series samples infected by strains of R1.4, ZA9.2, R17.1, and MAD2.1.

As validated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), one of the interferon-encoding genes (<italic>IFNB1</italic>) experienced significant activation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Recently, one study <xref rid="pone.0038367-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> reported an interferon-inducible gene signature (393 transcripts representing 307 unique Entrez Genes) in active pulmonary TB (PTB) patients specifically. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, we found this active PTB signature significantly overlapped with our THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature (55 unique Entrez Genes; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test).

<xref rid="pone.0038367-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Baechler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, were largely represented in overlapping genes. In addition, regulatory enrichment analysis showed that ISRE (corrected P-value: 1.05&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>), IRF-7 (corrected P-value: 9.23&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>), and IRF-1 (corrected P-value: 7.88&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) were also overrepresented in this active PTB-correlated whole-blood transcript signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). To further explore the relatedness of our identified THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature to the interferon response in an unbiased manner, we chose a series of gene modules that were constructed by a modular-based data-mining method <xref rid="pone.0038367-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Genes in each of these modules were coordinately expressed across one or more diseases and were associated with certain functional characteristics. Through comparison, we found that two modules, M2.10 and M3.1, largely overlapped with our THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Although no general functions in module M2.10 have been assigned yet, literature profiling <xref rid="pone.0038367-Chaussabel2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> had shown that those genes in M2.10 are as expected in the case of myeloid cells, such as THP-1 cells, infected with an inflammatory pathogen, such as <italic>Mtb</italic>. Module M3.1 is an interferon-relevant module, in which approximately half of the genes can be found in the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature. Regulatory enrichment analysis of the Module M3.1 also suggested its potential regulation by ISRE (corrected P-value: 3.29&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>), IRF-7 (corrected P-value: 1.55&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;19</sup>), and IRF-1 (corrected P-value: 2.12&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

When the separate cell sets were used in which bloods in PTB were separated into neutrophils, monocytes, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, significant positive correlations were also observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038367-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s008">Figure S8</xref>), with the most positive for neutrophils (Neut_PTB <italic>vs.</italic> Neut_Con with NES&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.27 and FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0).

</title><p>How immune cells cope with the heterogeneous nature of a pathogen is key to understand host-pathogen cross-talk. Using THP-1 cells as a host immune cell system, we have profiled time-course host transcriptome responses to distinct <italic>Mtb</italic> strains of the W-Beijing family. Although these strains show genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g001">Figure 1</xref>), surprisingly these differences were largely ignored by immune cells in terms of transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the effects of genetic diversity on the host were caused by functional biases, we have restricted our analysis based on specific functional categories and found the sample relationships were robustly preserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s003">Figure S3</xref>). More importantly, this genome-wide expression resource provides useful clues for understanding the ability of host cells to respond to this genetically diversified pathogen. From the temporal point of view, THP-1 cells after 4 h of infection did not exhibit obvious changes at the transcriptional level. From 4 h to 18 h, dramatic transcriptional changes occurred. Thereafter, this state of transcriptome lasted to 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figure 2</xref>), after which host cells underwent extensive death. With contrast to transcriptomes at 4 h (the early phase of THP-1 response), the transcriptomes at 18 h and 48 h represent balanced states between THP-1 cells and <italic>Mtb</italic> strains. From the epidemiological point of view, different groups of strains within W-Beijing family are known to have different transmissibility <xref rid="pone.0038367-Mestre1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Iwamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This different transmissibility may rely on their differential ability to modify the host immune response (both innate and adaptive immunity). However, we have shown that host transcriptional responses, at least in THP-1 cells, are not sensitive to the strain-to-strain variability. This is consistent with our recent report showing that cytokine secretion by human primary macrophages and dendritic cells was unaffected by the genetic diversity within the W-Beijing family <xref rid="pone.0038367-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The temporal duration of infections dwarfs genetic diversity of strains, which highly suggests the robustness of host cells to invasions from this evolving pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Potential Regulatory Mechanisms Underlying the Robustness of Host Cell Responses to <italic>Mtb</italic>
</title><p>Time-specific and genotype-irrelevant host transcriptome responses have allowed us to identify a common signature of host responses during the shift from 4 h to 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Using the concept of reverse engineering, functional and regulatory features have been inferred from this signature. We have observed that most of the genes in this signature are of functional relevance to immune-related processes and pathways, indicating rigorous activation of the immune response. It has been known for over a decade that immune cells, in particular phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells, exhibit a core gene expression profile when exposed to various microorganisms, even from diverse phyla <xref rid="pone.0038367-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Boldrick1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The core of immune-related genes found here in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected THP-1 cells is consistent with previous reports in other phagocytes <xref rid="pone.0038367-Tailleux1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Ramilo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Nau1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Ehrt1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Based on computationally predicted TFBSs, we have also identified several transcription factors (i.e., STATs, IRF-1, IRF-7, and Oct-1); the induction of both their putative targeted genes and their own may be largely responsible for the observed common host responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g004">4</xref>). Interestingly, transcriptional regulators such as NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0038367-Vallabhapurapu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, which are commonly believed to be pivotal in the immune response against pathogen, were not over-represented in genes significantly regulated at 18 h compared to 4 h. This is likely because the NF-&#x003ba;B (and genes influenced by this master regulator) might be involved before 18 h and thus we were not able to capture such involvement. Alternatively, transcriptional regulators identified in this study might compensate the absence of NF-&#x003ba;B. In the future, follow-up studies may be needed to clarify its exact regulatory roles.</p><p>The potential involvement of the immune-relevant transcriptional regulators in common host transcriptional responses has several important implications. First, STATs, IRF-1, IRF-7, and Oct-1 highlight the importance of interferons in host response to <italic>Mtb</italic>-infection. Indeed, one of the interferon-encoding genes (<italic>IFNB1</italic>) displays significant activation in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Further comparison with a clinical patient-linked signature and modules provides additional support for the importance of interferon-inducible genes and their putative regulators STATs, IRF-1, and IRF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g005">Figures 5B&#x02013;5E</xref>). Second, enrichment of Oct-1 binding site also implies its regulatory importance in the host response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Probably, Oct-1 cooperates with other regulators to form a regulatory network. In addition to our host model, two <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have previously reported the simultaneous activation of STATs, IRF-1, IRF-7, and Oct-1 after infection of human monocytes or dendritic cells by <italic>Mtb</italic> strains <xref rid="pone.0038367-Remoli1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038367-Ameixa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Third, our preliminary analysis suggests the mechanistic links between immune-relevant transcriptional regulators and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We suspect that the modulation of genes involved in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction by these regulators, probably in an additive/synergistic manner, may underpin the robustness of host cell responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing strains.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Perspectives on Future Studies of Host Transcriptional Responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> Pathogens</title><p>In additional to W-Beijing family strains, we have also profiled transcriptomic responses of THP-1 cells to the laboratory strain H37Rv. We observed no obvious host transcriptome differences between cells infected with W-Beijing strains and with H37Rv. No matter their origins, samples are generally grouped together according to the infection duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038367-g002">Figures 2A, S</xref>1, and S3). This observation needs further clarification involving more samples in future studies. Since this study has revealed the commonality of the host cell response to infection by different W-Beijing strains, it is also needed to investigate whether the host immune system responds in a similar or different way, upon infections of different strains from non-W-Beijing families.</p><p>We expect that, in the near future, the TB community could benefit from the use of the signature identified in this study. Although all of genes in this signature are potentially useful, practically only some of them should be taken as a priority. Based on their expertise and experimental convenience, researchers might only show interests in some genes for detailed functional studies. In particular, those genes involved in cytokine-cytokine interactions should be the focus of future studies for their clinical value as prognosis and diagnosis. Although currently we are tempted to these small-scale studies, we are always encouraged by signature-based microarray analysis of human TB patients once the techniques allow us to do so, both scientifically reliable and financially feasible.</p><p>In this setting, we have also shown that this <italic>in vitro</italic> THP-1 host cell model has great relevance to clinical tuberculosis. Processing transcriptome data from human tuberculosis patients, we have illustrated that the identified common host response signature is positively correlated with the PTB patients, no matter whether the patients were recruited from intermediate (UK) or high-burden (Sough Africa) regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038367-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0038367-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and accordingly is also correlated with patients of different therapy periods. Furthermore, we illustrated that the THP1r2<italic>Mtb</italic>-induced signature is tuberculosis specific and is irrelevant to human patients with other inflammatory diseases and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038367-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038367-t003">3</xref>). For these reasons and because of this signature potentially regulated by STATs, IRF-1, IRF-7, and Oct-1, we anticipate that establishing genome-wide links among these predicted regulators through high-throughput approaches (e.g. ChIP-seq <xref rid="pone.0038367-Barski1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>) might not only extend the knowledge we obtained from this study, but also allow us to explore their clinical value in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>

Prior to infection, THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophages with 200 nM PMA (Sigma) for 24 h. Then, THP-1 cells were infected at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 5. After 4, 18 and 48 h, the infected cells were collected for each of 11 <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing strains. Also, THP-1 cells were infected by the reference laboratory strain H37Rv, and the infected cells at 4, 18, and 48 h were collected (in duplicate). A total of 40 samples (including the 33 W-Beijing-infected samples, the 6 H37Rv-infected samples, and an uninfected sample at 0 h as a control) were subjected to the RNA extraction for microarray hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microarray Hybridization and Data Mining</title><p>RNA was treated for hybridization with HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Array according to the Affymetrix protocol. Then, arrays were scanned by a high-resolution scanner and the scanned images were converted to cell intensity file (.CEL files) using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS). CEL raw expression data were normalized and filtered as previously described <xref rid="pone.0038367-Tailleux1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Briefly, these CEL raw expression data were first normalized using Robust Multi-array Averaging (RMA) with quantile normalization in R (Bioconductor) <xref rid="pone.0038367-Gentleman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Detection call-based filter was then applied to remove all the probesets whose expression values were consistently below an empirically determined value of minimum sensitivity. This value was calculated according to the 95th percentile of all the &#x02018;Absent&#x02019; call-flagged signals of the entire dataset. Any expression values below this value are considered as being technically unreliable. Since the uninfected sample was served as a common control for the comparison, probesets with expression values less than this empirical value at the uninfected control were also removed. Finally, expression values of probesets in 39 infected samples were subtracted by their cognate values in the uninfected control (0 h).</p><p>After the normalization and pre-filtering above, a gene expression matrix (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038367.s015">Table S1</xref>) was constructed, containing 18,541 probesets (representing 10,315 unique Entrez Genes) across 39 samples, that is, time-courses (4 h, 18 h, and 48 h) of THP-1 cells infected by each of 11 <italic>Mtb</italic> W-Beijing strains as well as H37Rv (in duplicate).
