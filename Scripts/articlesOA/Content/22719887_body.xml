Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (<italic>M.tb</italic>) infection can be controlled in most infected individuals. However, in a minority of cases (5&#x0223c;10&#x00025;), the failure to contain the infection induces active tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0038429-Kaufmann1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Similar to the active disease, latent tuberculosis also includes a diverse range of patients <xref rid="pone.0038429-Barry1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038429-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This diversity makes the study of tuberculosis difficult, and more efficient tools are needed to further characterize the disease.</p><p>A well-used approach to the study of complex diseases is genome-wide transcriptional analysis. Previous studies have successfully obtained useful information regarding specific disease-associated signatures and the pathogenesis of tuberculosis using transcriptome analysis<xref rid="pone.0038429-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038429-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Scanning of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) rather than whole blood is also a common method <xref rid="pone.0038429-Querec1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> because it allows the identification of a set of signatures for differentiating tuberculosis patients from healthy individuals (including latent tuberculosis patients) <xref rid="pone.0038429-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and discriminating the subtle differences <xref rid="pone.0038429-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell-mediated immune responses play pivotal roles in controlling the growth of <italic>M.tb</italic> and maintaining the homeostasis of the host <xref rid="pone.0038429-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b3; is a cytokine that strongly promotes the T helper 1 (Th1) cell response, and it has also been demonstrated to act as a protective factor against tuberculosis in human and animal studies <xref rid="pone.0038429-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The IFN-&#x003b3; release assay is widely used in helping to diagnose <italic>M.tb</italic> infection. However, the debate of its clinic use continues as IFN-&#x003b3; release assay fails to distinguish between LTBI and active TB. In our study, participants with latent infection were segregated into two groups according to <italic>M.tb</italic>-specific IFN-&#x003b3; spot-forming cells (SFCs), as determined by a well-used tool of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay <xref rid="pone.0038429-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We discovered that two latent groups (low IFN-&#x003b3; expression group with lower SFCs and high IFN-&#x003b3; expression group with higher SFCs) possessed distinct gene expression profiles in their purified peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Importantly, a subset of latent individuals (with high IFN-&#x003b3; expression) had transcriptional signatures similar to those of active tuberculosis patients <xref rid="pone.0038429-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, In addition, we detected an increase in the expression of BAFF and APRIL during the disease stage, but not in latency population. The strong expression levels of BAFF and APRIL in the pleural effusion of patients with tuberculosis pleurisy (TP) further indicated their effects on disease status and in extrapulmonary TB. Moreover, soluble APRIL correlated with IFN-&#x003b3; expression level in the pleural effusion of patients with TP, which suggests that the correlation between APRIL and IFN-&#x003b3; may be useful for predicting tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects and Samples</title><p>Healthy individuals with no history of tuberculosis disease, smear positive untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients (TB, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;39), and patients with tuberculosis pleurisy (TP, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21) were recruited from the Tuberculosis hospital, China.

Among detected genes, LTB<sub>L</sub> and HD clustered as a category, but LTB<sub>H</sub> is more close to active Tuberculosis. These results suggest that LTB<sub>L</sub> and HD participants have similar gene expression profiles in their peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Although LTB<sub>L</sub> and LTB<sub>H</sub> are both latent TB classes, their transcription profiles are actually quite distinct. The TB group did not cluster with any other group directly, which indicates that the peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of these patients have unique gene expression profiles, and these characteristics help us to well understand TB patients from healthy and latent participants.</p><p>With regard to ranked GO terms or KEGG Pathways, the significantly altered expression of genes in the LTB<sub>L</sub> group were mainly associated with stimulus responses, suggesting that the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of the LTB<sub>L</sub> participants might easily respond to <italic>M.tb</italic>-antigen stimulation. The CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of the LTB<sub>H</sub> group could easily alternate between their roles in movement and metabolism because many migration- and metabolism-related GO terms were ranked in the LTB<sub>H</sub> group. The TB group has the largest number of genes ranked by GO terms and KEGG pathways. This is reasonable to assume that the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of TB patients do not appear to be functionally impaired and may possess the most protective potential and act for alterations in metabolism, migration, adhesion, apoptosis and respond to stimulus.</p><p>Although many studies have confirmed the indispensability of IFN-&#x003b3; in the prevention of TB development, correlation of IFN-&#x003b3; levels and protection ability still debate <xref rid="pone.0038429-Kaufmann2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, it is essential to identify other tuberculosis-specific signatures. In this study, TNFSF and TNFRSF genes were screened for further validation because some of them have previously been confirmed to have effects on TB development. TNF-&#x003b1; promotes granuloma formation, which is involved in preventing the dissemination of bacilli <xref rid="pone.0038429-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and anti-TNF-&#x003b1; treatment for rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of active tuberculosis development <xref rid="pone.0038429-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

In our study, soluble CD30 and FASLG were also markedly up-regulated in the plasma of tuberculosis patients (data not shown).</p><p>Furthermore, our results indicate that BAFF and APRIL expression is significantly elevated during active tuberculosis infections. And, a stronger secretion of soluble BAFF and APRIL was observed in the pleural effusion of TP patients, which suggests that the two cytokines are involved in pulmonary and extraplumonary Tuberculosis and may reflect disease exacerbation. Although the levels of sAPRIL were lower in the <italic>M.tb</italic> antigen-stimulated supernatants than in un-stimulated supernatants of TB patients, we hypothesize that the down-regulation of sAPRIL is caused by its consumption during stimulation because it has been shown to play an anti-apoptotic role through an autocrine pathway <xref rid="pone.0038429-Kern1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>BAFF and APRIL previously reported as two important mediators of B cells <xref rid="pone.0038429-Mackay1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, also affect the survival and activation of T cells <xref rid="pone.0038429-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038429-Huard1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In particular, BAFF also promotes the Th1 response <xref rid="pone.0038429-Scapini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Certain cytokines, such as IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b1;, can induce various cells to augment BAFF production <xref rid="pone.0038429-Litinskiy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Nardelli1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, IL-4 can inhibit BAFF expression <xref rid="pone.0038429-Nardelli1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Similar to BAFF, APRIL has been shown to be up-regulated in response to IFN-&#x003b3; and IFN-&#x003b1; treatment <xref rid="pone.0038429-Litinskiy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Craxton1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our study, TB and TP patients secreted high antigen specific IFN-&#x003b3; level detected by ELISPOT (SFCs&#x0003e;110), and plasma level of IFN-&#x003b3; were markedly increased in the pleural effusion of TP patients but with low IL-4 level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038429.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, the dramatic enhancement of sBAFF and sAPRIL levels in patients might be caused by the stronger IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated effects that outweigh the inhibitory effects of IL-4. The exact mechanisms of sBAFF and sAPRIL production require further examination. BAFF has two forms: membrane-bound and soluble <xref rid="pone.0038429-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. An analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the frequency of BAFF<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is increased in TB patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038429-g003">Figure 3</xref>.C).

Thus, it appears that sBAFF might act as a suppressor and inhibit the binding of membrane-bound BAFF to its receptors.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038429-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows there are forty-five known genes that interact with <italic>BAFF</italic> and/or <italic>APRIL</italic>. An IPA analysis was employed to analyze the interactions and RT-PCR results indicated that a largest number of pathways emanate from apoptosis-related genes, such as BCL2 (data not shown). Therefore, network-regulated apoptosis is important for the fate of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and might indirectly affect tuberculosis outcome. As an autocrine factor <xref rid="pone.0038429-Kern1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Huard2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, BAFF has also been reported to induce BCL2 up-regulation through BAFFR-mediated signaling <xref rid="pone.0038429-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and to promote T cell survival <xref rid="pone.0038429-Ng2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The cytoplasmic tail of BAFFR has TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-interacting motifs (TIMs) <xref rid="pone.0038429-Dempsey1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which are involved in mediating cell survival, activation and differentiation. Thus, BAFF might prevent peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from apoptosis in patients and this mechanism might be related to the induction of <italic>BCL2</italic> gene expression.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038429-g004">Figure 4</xref> also shows the intimate association between the Th1 response and the BAFF/APRIL system.

<xref rid="pone.0038429-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A few publications revealed that BAFF is expressed on activated T cells and promotes the Th1 response <xref rid="pone.0038429-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038429-Huard1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. BAFF and IFN-&#x003b3; have also been shown to establish an inflammatory loop between T and myeloid cells that exacerbates autoimmunity <xref rid="pone.0038429-Scapini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To our knowledge, no direct relation between APRIL and the Th1 response has been reported. However, among the TNFSF-related genes, APRIL is most closely related to BAFF; they share &#x0223c;30&#x00025; sequence identity in their TNF homology domains (THDs) <xref rid="pone.0038429-Dillon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. APRIL may play a similar role in disease of Tuberculosis. Moreover, we found strong positive correlations between Th1 cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-12p70 and IL-2) and sAPRIL in the pleural effusion of TP patients. Thus, these studies suggest a reciprocal relationship between the BAFF/APRIL system and the Th1 response in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB patients. In our study, we found effects of the BAFF/APRIL system on tuberculosis to be intriguing. Future studies involving novel ideas and participants are necessary to discern the role of the BAFF/APRIL system in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.</p><p>In summary, our results herein suggest that the elevated expression levels of BAFF and APRIL are associated with active pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis and that the BAFF/APRIL system is intimately correlated with the Th1 response. These results implicate a potential use for the combination of BAFF and/or APRIL with IFN-&#x003b3; in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Moreover, the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell-derived transcriptional signatures of distinct latency populations might be helpful to identify subsets of latent individuals that produce protective responses against tuberculosis. However, longitudinal studies must be performed to assess this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0038429.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
