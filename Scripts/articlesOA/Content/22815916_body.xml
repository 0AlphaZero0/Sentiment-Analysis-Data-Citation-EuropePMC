<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a serious animal and zoonotic disease that not only causes significant financial loss but is also a public health hazard. Although the main hosts of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, the causative agent of bTB, are cattle, other animals, including humans, may be affected as well <xref rid="pone.0041066-Biet1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Infections in humans are associated with unpasteurized dairy product consumption and through contact to infected cattle. bTB is a factor that undermines the development of the dairy and meat industry and international commerce. <italic>M. bovis</italic> is closely related to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of human tuberculosis (TB), and both species are included in the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex. In humans and cattle the disease is principally an infection of the respiratory system <xref rid="pone.0041066-Corner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Neill1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Whipple1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>A large-scale transcriptional gene expression analysis has been used to define the repertoire of genes expressed in host-pathogen interactions between tuberculosis and many other infectious diseases <xref rid="pone.0041066-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This kind of transcriptional approach has significantly contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in these interactions, the cross-talk between intracellular pathogens and their host cells, and to identify novel mechanisms of bacterial evasion or immunological elimination. In addition, the characterization of the transcriptional profile associated with the resolution of infection or the development of disease may not only contribute to a deeper knowledge of the immunological parameters related to pathology but also to the identification of biomarkers that allow the prediction of disease outcome in cattle. The use of these biomarkers would be extremely useful for the detection of potential TB-transmitting animals in infected herds, which in turn may contribute to the control of bTB transmission between cattle and humans. Moreover, it has been proposed that the bovine is a robust animal model for preclinical safety and efficient evaluation of TB candidate vaccines targeting human population <xref rid="pone.0041066-Buddle1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, biomarkers can also be used to anticipate the outcome of vaccine TB-protection assays in bovine models of infection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the gene expression profile of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cattle infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> upon specific antigen stimulation. We found that more than 5,930 genes changed their level of expression upon infection of cattle with <italic>M. bovis</italic>. Further evaluation of RNA expression levels in PBMCs from cattle experimentally infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> confirmed the microarray results for a subset of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DNA Microarray Analysis</title><p>Comprehensive gene expression profiles of six PBMC samples from <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected calves and five PBMC samples from five healthy calves were generated with high-density oligonucleotide bovine arrays (Affymetrix) with 24,072 probe sets, which in total interrogated the expression levels of approximately 23,000 transcripts, some of which map to known genes.</p><p>A total of 5,920 probe sets passed the filtering step described in Materials and Methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041066.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Limma&#x02019;s linear models and empirical Bayes corrections for multiple comparisons were applied to assess the statistical significance of the expression profiles of the probe sets obtained in the previous step. Considering a threshold of 0.05 for the adjusted P value and an absolute value of log-2fold change equal to or greater than 2.5 (absolute value), 172 unique probe sets showed a differential expression that was statistically significant. Twenty-four out of these 172 unique probes were upregulated and 148 were downregulated in the PBMCs of <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected cattle. A complete list of the differentially-expressed genes and the relative fold-change in expression between healthy and <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected groups is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041066.s002">Table S1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041066-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041066-t002">2</xref> summarize these results. Data show that the highest differentially-expressed genes were mainly downregulated in PBMCs of <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected cattle. Further inspection of these genes revealed that many of them are related to immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, endocytosis and cellular trafficking. In addition, some genes encoding proteins involved in cellular matrix degradation displayed downregulated expression in the PBMCs from the <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041066-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0041066-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0041066.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The most relevant downregulated genes in PBMCs of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infected cattle.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0041066-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0041066.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Process</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symbol</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">adj.P.Val</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene name</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1">

To corroborate that the data set generated in the microarray analysis was not due to a bias in the sampled animals, the RT-qPCRs were performed in another set of experimentally infected cattle. PBMCs were collected from eight calves at 0 and 120 days post-experimental infection with <italic>M. bovis</italic>. With the exception of gene <italic>CSF2</italic> the RT-qPCR results validated the microarray data for the genes tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041066-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the fold changes assessed by RT-qPCR were often greater than those determined by microarray analyses for the same genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041066-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041066-t002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041066.s002">Table S1</xref>).

Thus, these results, together with those of the microarray experiment, indicate that the expression of <italic>CD14, IL-1R, THBS1, MMP9</italic> and <italic>FYVE</italic> is downregulated in cattle infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic>.

PBMCs represent an accessible tissue for the development of improved diagnostics. Moreover, previous studies have shown that the immune responses generated in the peripheral blood of cattle with tuberculosis reflect those elicited at the site of the disease <xref rid="pone.0041066-Rhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This comparative transcriptional profile identified gene expression pathways involved in immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, endocytosis and cellular trafficking as highly downregulated in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected animals. Remarkably, the expression of several matrix metallopeptidases was significantly downregulated in infected animals. Only a few genes were significantly upregulated in infected animals and most of them encoded immune response-related proteins, such as IFN&#x003b3;, interleukines, etc. Consistent with the findings of this study, it has been previously reported, in several studies, that the immuno-specific gene expression undergoes shutoff in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected cattle. Meade and coworkers have shown that the expression of several genes involved in the innate immune response was suppressed in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected cattle <xref rid="pone.0041066-Meade1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, two consecutive studies of the same research group have reported that the balance in the transcriptional changes induced by <italic>M. bovis</italic> in different cell blood populations is suppression of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0041066-Killick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Meade1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>To determine the main biological processes associated with the differentially expressed genes, we clustered these genes in cellular pathways. In this analysis, we included all differentially-expressed genes that passed the statistical test without considering the fold changes. We observed statistically significant enrichment of induced genes in several pathways, but except for those encoding proteins involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway, most of them were related to unspecific biological functions. In contrast, the repressed genes were mainly categorized in cellular trafficking pathways, such as endocytosis, phagosome, lysosome, MAP kinase signaling and regulation of the cytoskeleton, all functions associated with tuberculosis infections.</p><p>As mentioned above, the expression of four metallopeptidases was dowregulated in PBMCs of infected animals. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) were first described as enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. However, further studies have demonstrated that MMPs can modify many non-matrix substrates, such as cytokines and chemokines <xref rid="pone.0041066-VanLint1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Chemokines play a central role in leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection, influencing the result of the inflammatory response. Proteolysis of chemokines by MMPs can either reduce or potentiate their activities. It has been reported that MMP3 inactivates several chemokines, while MMP9 increases the potency of at least two chemokines and inactivates several others <xref rid="pone.0041066-VanLint1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The role of MMP9 in tuberculosis infection has been extensively studied <xref rid="pone.0041066-Matsuura1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Hoheisel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. MMP9 is induced in cultured <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected monocytes <xref rid="pone.0041066-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and in epithelial cells, and it promotes granuloma formation <xref rid="pone.0041066-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Volkman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>CD14</italic> and IL-<italic>1R</italic> were among the inflammatory-response-related genes whose expression was highly repressed in PBMCs from <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected cattle. It has been reported that CD14 mediates the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> TDM-induced proinflammatory response via SR/toll-like receptors 2 <xref rid="pone.0041066-Bowdish1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. <italic>IL-1R</italic> encodes a cytokine receptor that belongs to the interleukin 1 receptor family. This protein is a receptor for several cytokines involved in inflammatory responses. Therefore, the downregulation of <italic>CD14</italic> and <italic>IL-1R</italic> expression in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected animals suggests that the bacilli inhibit signaling pathways of antibacterial host defense. Moreover, the expression of <italic>CD14</italic> together with the thrombospondin 1 gene (<italic>THSP1</italic>) is repressed in CD4&#x0002b; T lymphocytes cocultured with monocytes in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as part of a suppression mechanism <xref rid="pone.0041066-SmitvanDixhoorn1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> induced by suppressor carbohydrates generated from CD8&#x0002b; T cells.</p><p>Finally, the repressed <italic>FYVE</italic> gene encodes a domain found in various proteins including some implicated in vacuolar protein sorting and endosome function. The FYVE domain is implicated in signal transduction and membrane trafficking functions, such as stabilization of the interaction of early endosome antigen 1 with the small GTPase Rab5 <xref rid="pone.0041066-Simonsen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, FYVE domains might have additional functions <xref rid="pone.0041066-Leevers1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Meade et al. <xref rid="pone.0041066-Meade1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> analyzed the expression profile of non-stimulated PBMCs from cattle infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic>. This study has revealed downregulation of the expression of key innate immune genes, including the toll-like receptor 2 (<italic>TLR2</italic>) and <italic>TLR4</italic>. Consistently with that finding, we detected reduced relative expression of <italic>TLR2</italic>, <italic>TLR3</italic> and <italic>TLR4</italic> in the <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected group (&#x02212;2.467-fold, &#x02212;1.172-fold, &#x02212;1.816-fold, respectively).</p><p>Two recent transcriptomic studies have deeply explored the global expression changes induced by <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection in a variety of blood cell populations <xref rid="pone.0041066-Killick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Magee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In one of these studies, Killick et al <xref rid="pone.0041066-Killick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> identified the transcriptional profile of peripheral blood leukocytes from cattle infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic>, finding that the top ranking canonical pathway was involved in the inflammatory response. Importantly, several genes involved in TLR-mediated signaling and host immune-related genes that have displayed reduced relative expression in the study of Killick et al. were also found to be downregulated in the current study. For instance, <italic>MYD88</italic> (&#x02212;0.765-fold), <italic>MAPK13</italic> (&#x02212;1.780-fold), <italic>MAPK14</italic> (&#x02212;0773-fold), <italic>TREM1</italic> (&#x02212;4,011-fold), <italic>TYROBP</italic> (&#x02212;2.602-fold), <italic>DEFBIO</italic> (&#x02212;1.144-fold), <italic>IL-16</italic> (&#x02212;1.245-fold) and <italic>IL-18</italic> (&#x02212;1.304-fold).</p><p>In its recent study, Aranday-Cortes have found that the expression of <italic>CXCL9</italic>, <italic>CXCL10</italic>, <italic>GZMA</italic> and <italic>IL-22</italic> was significantly increased in PBMC from infected cattle compared to na&#x000ef;ve animals following PPD stimulation <xref rid="pone.0041066-ArandayCortes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In the current study we found that the expression of <italic>CXCL10</italic> was highly upregulated and the expression of <italic>GZMA</italic> was downregulated in infected animals, but the microarray data of these genes did not pass the statistical test. Probes sets for either <italic>CXCL9</italic> or <italic>IL-22</italic> were not represented in the microarrays used in this study; therefore we failed to assess the expression of these genes.</p><p>Previous studies on gene transcription profiling in peripheral blood cells of TB patients have identified the IFN signalling as the most significantly over-represented pathway <xref rid="pone.0041066-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041066-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Although we found significant upregulation of the IFN&#x003b3;, most of the downstream genes of IFN signaling pathways showed a reduced relative expression in infected animals. In fact, the expression of <italic>IFNGR2</italic>, the signal transduction chain of IFN&#x003b3; receptor, was significantly downregulated in the infected group, suggesting a functional blockade of some aspects of IFN&#x003b3; signaling. It has been reported that the IFNGR2 chain is constitutively expressed, but its expression level may be tightly regulated according to the state of cellular differentiation or activation <xref rid="pone.0041066-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. For example, IFN&#x003b3; can produce growth inhibition of some CD4&#x0002b; Th1 cell populations <xref rid="pone.0041066-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, downregulation of IFNGR2 would block growth-inhibitory effects of IFN&#x003b3;, allowing the Th1 cell proliferation, which is consistent with a bTB immune-profile.</p><p>The MHC loading class II transactivator, <italic>CIITA</italic>, the transporter associated with antigen processing <italic>TAP</italic>, the major histocompatibility complex class II DM alpha-chain <italic>HLA-DMA</italic>, the <italic>BLA-DQB</italic> MHC class II antigen, and the bovine major histocompatibility complex class II genes (BOLA) are some of the identified upregulated genes in <italic>M. bovis</italic> infected cattle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041066.s002">Table S1</xref>). These results indicate that one of the cell effects triggered by IFN&#x003b3;, the MHC I and II antigen presentation pathway, is clearly induced in infected animals in spite of the downregulation of the specific IFN&#x003b3; signal transduction pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here suggest that the differentially-expressed genes identified using microarray analysis and validated in additional samples by qRT-PCR play a role in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, these genes may serve as biomarkers for bTB-infection status. However, it is important to take into consideration that some of the gene expression changes observed in this study may not be specific for <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection and may represent a shared transcriptional program induced by infectious diseases. Thus, further studies are needed to investigate this possibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animal experimentations were performed inside the biosafety facilities of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), Argentina, in compliance with the regulations of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of INTA and authorized by the National Service of Agricultural and Food Health and Quality (SENASA) and National Consultant Commission of Agricultural Biotechnology (CONABIA).
