<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolomics provides unprecedented insights into the biology of an organism in the state of disease. In particular, metabolites can be viewed as a close recapitulation of the disease phenotype, closer to ongoing pathogenesis in an organism than changes in gene expression <xref rid="pone.0040221-Illig1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Consequently, metabolomics has deepened our understanding of biological mechanisms involved in several noninfectious diseases and provided a platform for the identification of new biomarkers <xref rid="pone.0040221-KaddurahDaouk1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

It is characterized by chronic latency without clinical symptoms in the vast majority of infected individuals. Of the more than 2 billion people infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> globally, less than one-tenth is likely to develop active TB during their lifetime and in the majority of cases infection remains in an asymptomatic stage of latency. Even though TB can be cured, drug treatment is long-lasting and complex, and requires at least three drugs given over a minimum of 6 months. In many regions, notably in developing countries with high TB incidences, diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, and an estimated 40% of TB patients fail to be correctly diagnosed <xref rid="pone.0040221-Lonnroth1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The tuberculin skin test (TST) diagnoses immunologic sensitization to mycobacteria, indicating exposure, and hence cannot be used to distinguish infected healthy individuals from patients with active TB. More recently, gene expression profiling has shown promise in differentiating between infection states in TB <xref rid="pone.0040221-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040221-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>We investigated the feasibility of identifying small molecule biochemical profiles in serum for gaining novel biological insights into the mechanisms underlying TB. The aim of this study is to use metabolites as biomarkers of TB infection and disease status, and to elucidate their role in protection and pathogenesis in TB. We acquired information on 428 distinct small molecules, including amino acids, short peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, nucleotides and cofactors, and compared the characteristic metabolomic profiles of three groups: (i) healthy <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-uninfected controls (TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup>), (ii) latently <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected healthy individuals (TST<sup>+</sup>), and (iii) patients with active TB (TB<sup>active</sup>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040221.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We defined several remarkable differences between the metabolic profiles of healthy subjects and TB patients, including lower relative abundances of amino acids, medium-chain fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), higher relative abundances of fibrinopeptides and adenosine degradation products inosine, hypoxanthine and ribose, as well other compounds, such as bile acids and uremic toxins. The observed differences and correlations between compound abundances allowed us to construct functional clusters and infer their biological significance in TB disease progression. In addition, we could identify a serum metabolomic biomarker set that distinguishes active TB from the two groups of healthy subjects, which is a necessary first step towards the use of metabolic biomarkers in TB diagnosis. We also found that distinct cytokine abundances in several instances correlated with the relative abundances of metabolites, indicating a functional link between these systems. Finally, we studied the role of tryptophan degradation by indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a well-known immunosuppressive mechanism. We revealed that IDO1 expression was upregulated in pulmonary lesions from mice suffering from experimental TB.

For example, all medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) formed a uniform group of correlated biochemical compound profiles. Moreover, correct identification of functionally related compounds should allow close correlation of xenobiotics with their metabolites. Consistent with this prediction, degradation products of xenobiotics, including caffeine, stachydrine, salicylate and acetaminophen (Tylenol), were tightly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040221-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040221.s003">S3</xref>).</p><p>We labeled the clusters by the predominant pathway or type of metabolic compound found within the particular cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040221.s007">Table S4</xref>).

Subjects were balanced between the groups with respect to age and gender. Clinically relevant information on patients is available upon request. Samples were stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C. At the time of sample collection, none of the TB patients was a recipient of TB treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Samples were stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C until processed. Sample preparation was carried out as described previously <xref rid="pone.0040221-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> at Metabolon, Inc. Briefly, recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for quality control purposes. To remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills Genogrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into four fractions: one for analysis by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS; positive mode), one for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS (negative mode), one for analysis by gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and one sample was reserved for backup.</p><p>Three types of controls were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples: samples generated from a pool of human plasma (extensively characterized by Metabolon, Inc.) served as technical replicate throughout the data set; extracted water samples served as process blanks; and a cocktail of standards spiked into every analyzed sample allowed instrument performance monitoring. Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers (median RSD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10%; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30 standards). Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e., non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled human plasma samples (median RSD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15%; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;239 metabolites). Experimental samples and controls were randomized across the platform run.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Mass Spectrometry Analysis</title><p>Non-targeted MS analysis was performed at Metabolon, Inc. Extracts were subjected to either GC-MS <xref rid="pone.0040221-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> or UPLC-MS/MS <xref rid="pone.0040221-Sha1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. The chromatography was standardized and once the method was validated, no further changes were made. As part of Metabolon&#x02019;s general practice, all columns were purchased from a single manufacturer&#x02019;s lot at the outset of experiments. All solvents were similarly purchased in bulk from a single manufacturer&#x02019;s lot in sufficient quantity to complete all related experiments. For each sample, vacuum-dried samples were dissolved in injection solvent containing eight or more injection standards at fixed concentrations, depending on the platform. The internal standards were used both to assure injection and chromatographic consistency. Instruments were tuned and calibrated for mass resolution and mass accuracy daily.</p><p>The UPLC-MS/MS platform utilized a Waters Acquity UPLC and a ThermoFisher LTQ mass spectrometer, which included an electrospray ionization source and a linear ion-trap mass analyzer. The instrumentation was set to monitor for positive ions in acidic extracts or negative ions in basic extracts through independent injections. The instrument was set to scan 99&#x02013;1000 m/z and alternated between MS and MS/MS scans. The scan speed was approximately six scans per s (three MS and three MS/MS scans). MS/MS scans were collected using dynamic exclusion, a process in which after an MS/MS scan of a specific m/z has been obtained, then that m/z is placed on a temporary MS/MS exclude list for a user-set period of time to allow greater MS/MS coverage of ions present in the MS scan because the instrument will not trigger an MS/MS scan of the same ion repeatedly. Extracts were loaded onto columns (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1&#x000d7;100 mm, 1.7 &#x000b5;m) and gradient-eluted with water and 95% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid (acidic extracts) or 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate (basic extracts). Columns were washed and reconditioned after every injection.</p><p>The samples destined for analysis by GC-MS were dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 18 h prior to being derivatized under dried nitrogen using bistrimethyl-silyltrifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% phenyldimethyl silicone column with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60&#x000b0; to 340&#x000b0;C within a 17-min period. All samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ MS operated at unit mass resolving power with electron impact ionization and a 50&#x02013;750 atomic mass unit scan range.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Compound Identification, Quantification, and Data Curation</title><p>Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon <xref rid="pone.0040221-DeHaven1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Identification of known chemical entities is based on comparison to metabolomic library entries of purified standards. Over 2,400 commercially available purified standard compounds have been acquired and registered into LIMS for distribution to both the LC/MS and GC/MS platforms for determination of their detectable characteristics. An additional 5,300 mass spectral entries have been created for structurally unnamed biochemicals, which have been identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral). These compounds have the potential to be identified by future acquisition of a matching purified standard or by classical structural analysis. Peaks were quantified using area under the curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Multiplex Cytokine/chemokine Analysis</title><p>Cytokine and chemokine levels in serum were measured using a premixed 42-plex MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine kit (Millipore GmbH, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

T cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit, Molecular Probes) at 2.5 uM according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. After 4 days of coculture, T cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry using anti-CD3, -CD4 and -CD8 monoclonal antibodies (all from BD) in combination with CFSE. Lymphocytes were gated based on forward and side scatter, and propidium iodide-positive cells were excluded from the analysis. The reduction in CFSE fluorescence intensity was analyzed on CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> gated cells.

For a general comparison, biochemical compounds with altered levels in the different groups (TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, TST<sup>+</sup> and TB<sup>active</sup>) were obtained and compared using t-test and Wilcoxon sum rank test (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040221.s005">Table S2</xref>).

Also, several groups of biochemically similar compounds were tested in an ANOVA. Second, a RF classifier was used to identify biomarkers sufficiently distinct between groups. Functional linkage between different compounds was obtained by first fitting a simple linear model for each compound and subsequently calculating the correlation coefficient between the models&#x02019; residuals applying a bootstrapping procedure. In the applied linear model Y&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;aX+b, where Y equals group classification (TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, TST<sup>+</sup> and TB<sup>active</sup>) and X is the vector of the relative levels of the compounds. R scripts used to generate the data are available upon request. Significantly correlated compound profiles were used to infer clusters of functionally related small biochemical compounds. To explore the link between metabolic and cytokine profiles, we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients between the analyzed cytokine profiles and small metabolic compounds, and corrected for multiple testing. Next, to determine which categories of metabolic compounds correlated with cytokine and chemokine profiles, we performed an enrichment analysis using a hypergeometric test for the main categories of metabolic compounds (amino acids, carbohydrates, cofactors and vitamins, energy metabolism, lipids, nucleotides, peptides and xenobiotics).</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Classification Analysis</title><p>The predictive value of small metabolic compounds as biomarkers in TB diagnosis was estimated using a supervised machine learning algorithm <xref rid="pone.0040221-Breiman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, as implemented in the R package &#x0201c;randomForest&#x0201d; (RF) <xref rid="pone.0040221-Liaw1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>.
