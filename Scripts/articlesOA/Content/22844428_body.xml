In the primate model, natural SIV hosts that do not develop pathogenic immunodeficiency have low levels of generalized immune activation compared to pathogenic SIV infections <xref rid="pone.0041093-Bosinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Sodora1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In humans, systemic markers of immune activation are associated with higher HIV viral loads and faster progression to AIDS <xref rid="pone.0041093-Giorgi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Variations in immune activation among HIV-infected individuals may result from several factors, such as host genetics, microbial translocation, malnutrition, and co-infection with other pathogens <xref rid="pone.0041093-Barnabas1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Kaul1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For example, HIV co-infection with pathogens that non-specifically activate host immunity, such as <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, helminths, HSV, and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, has been associated with enhanced virological replication, which could lead to more efficient HIV transmission and faster progression to AIDS <xref rid="pone.0041093-Barnabas1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Walson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Among HIV-uninfected individuals, immune activation can also enhance HIV susceptibility following exposure to HIV. Non-ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases, such as asymptomatic incident HSV infections, increase the risk of HIV acquisition via local recruitment and activation of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and macrophages, which increase the number of target cells for HIV entry <xref rid="pone.0041093-Heng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition to local inflammation, some sexually transmitted infections, such as chronic asymptomatic HSV, are associated with systemic immune activation <xref rid="pone.0041093-Sheth1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While the effect of systemic immune activation on HIV susceptibility has not been firmly established, there is evidence that factors other than local inflammation influence the immunologic milieu at mucosal sites of HIV exposure. For example, the genital tracts of Kenyan women have more activated CD4&#x0002b; T cells compared to women from San Francisco, independent of genital co-infections or behavioral factors that may influence local genital inflammation <xref rid="pone.0041093-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, systemic immunological profiles correlate with natural resistance to HIV, as low levels of peripheral T cell activation are found in individuals who remain uninfected despite frequent exposure to HIV <xref rid="pone.0041093-McLaren1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Pancino1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The elevation of systemic immune activation markers found in HIV-uninfected Africans and Asians compared to Europeans has been attributed to chronic exposure to endemic infections, and may be one of the factors driving regional disparities in HIV rates around the world <xref rid="pone.0041093-Kalinkovich1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Koesters1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Among potential exposures in regions with high HIV rates, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG (a live attenuated vaccine) are exceedingly common and elicit potent systemic immune responses that may influence HIV infectiousness. It is estimated that worldwide over 2 billion individuals have latent infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and almost 10 million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB) occur each year. Despite controversy regarding the efficacy of the BCG vaccine, approximately 100 million doses are given to infants each year. The transcriptional signatures of whole blood obtained from patients infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> reflect systemic immune activation in both patients with active TB and asymptomatic individuals with latent infection <xref rid="pone.0041093-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. BCG vaccination can also activate systemic immune pathways associated with T cell activation which persist even after clearance of the bacteria, enhance immune responses to unrelated pathogens in infants, and modulate mucosal immunity <xref rid="pone.0041093-Alexandroff1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Croix1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041093-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

At the time of stimulation, bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in complete RPMI and co-cultured with isolated PBMC in complete RPMI supplemented with IL-2 at 37&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;48 hours.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Single-cycle HIV-1 Infection Assay</title><p>After stimulation, the cells were washed with fresh RPMI and CD4&#x0002b; cells were isolated from stimulated PBMC by negative selection using a CD4&#x0002b; T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi biotech; GmbH) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Isolated CD4&#x0002b; cells were infected with a single-cycle replication-competent, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing proviral construct pseudotyped with CCR5-tropic or CXCR4-tropic envelope (NL43-deltaEnvGFP), as previously described <xref rid="pone.0041093-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Briefly, stimulated CD4&#x0002b; cells were spinoculated for 2 hrs with the virus. The infected cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 72 hours. Fluorescence emitted by the cells carrying GFP-expressing virus was quantified using Cellquest Pro software (Beckton Dickinson) to calculate percent infectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Immunoflourescence Staining and Flow Cytometry Analysis</title><p>Stimulated CD4&#x0002b; cells were washed and then stained with directly conjugated antibodies to cell surface markers, including CD4-FITC, CD3-PE, CD38-PE, HLA DR-FITC, CD195&#x02013;PE, and CD184-FITC (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and TLR-2 FITC (R&#x00026;D biosystems). Marker expression analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BDIS). A minimum of 10,000 viable lymphocytes was collected for each run.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Quantitative Reverse-transcription PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> CD4&#x0002b; stimulated cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Fluorescently-labeled cDNA was generated using oligod(T) primers and Superscript III (Invitrogen), using fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham). cDNA corresponding to each transcript was subjected to 34 cycles of PCR for quantification using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041093.s001">Table S1</xref>. The cycle threshold value (C<sub>T</sub>) obtained for each gene of interest (GOI) was normalized with that of GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, in order to obtain the normalized cycle threshold (nC<sub>T</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;(GOI C<sub>T</sub>) &#x02013; (HKG C<sub>T</sub>)). The change in cycle threshold (&#x00394;CT) was calculated using the following formula: (&#x00394;CT&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;C<sub>(nCT)</sub> &#x02013; S<sub>(nCT)</sub>), where C represents unstimulated cells (negative control) and S represents cells stimulated with mycobacteria or phytohemagglutinin (PHA; positive control). Prior to reverse transcription, control and mutant RNA (10 ng) were treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) and subjected to 36 cycles of PCR to assure that all DNA had been removed, as assessed by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>siRNA Transfection</title><p>Transfection of monocytes was performed using negative control scrambled small interfering RNA (siRNA) or siRNA targeting TLR-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded at 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells per well in a 6 well plate with reduced siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 5&#x02013;8 hours at 37&#x000b0;C with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>. The media were then replaced and the cells were allowed to rest overnight, followed by stimulation with individual strains of mycobacteria. Paired samples were subsequently subject to either immunoflourescence staining with TLR 2 antibody or virus infectivity assays, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was determined by students T Test.
