<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately one third of the world&#x02019;s population is estimated to be latently infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.tb</italic>), the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), which is responsible for about 8&#x02013;10 million active new cases of TB each year <xref rid="pone.0045839-Raviglione1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Schuck1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A bacteriologically confirmed diagnosis of TB is challenging, as direct microscopy has low sensitivity, bacterial culture takes 2 to 4 weeks, and sputum samples can be microbiologically false negative. Effective treatment of active TB is crucial in containing spread of the disease, and better diagnostics would greatly impact on TB control by facilitating early treatment. Little is known about the precise mechanisms and pathways that control protective versus pathogenic immunity during TB <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The IL-12/IFN-&#x003b3; and the TNF/TNFR axis are both crucial in protection during <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, as genetic (<italic>e.g.</italic> defects in the IL-12/IL-23/IFN-&#x003b3;/STAT1 axis) or acquired (HIV; immune-suppressants; anti-cytokine auto-antibodies) defects strongly increase host-susceptibility to mycobacterial disease <xref rid="pone.0045839-vandeVosse1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045839-Levin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b3; is produced mostly by CD4+ T cells and assists macrophages in controlling intracellular <italic>M.tb</italic> infection through various anti-microbial immunity pathways, which include phagosomal maturation; anti-microbial peptides; oxidative stress; apoptosis and autophagy <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although IFN-&#x003b3; is essential to protection against <italic>M.tb</italic>, it is not in itself a correlate of protection, however.</p><p>Several studies have profiled gene expression patterns in peripheral blood from TB patients <xref rid="pone.0045839-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In a most comprehensive recent study, Berry <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> reported a previously unappreciated role of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling in TB pathogenesis. Blood transcriptional profiles of active TB patients were dominated by a neutrophil driven IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; inducible gene expression profile <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A more recent study compared gene expression patterns in the blood of tuberculosis and sarcoidosis patients (of European descent), a chronic inflammatory lung disease with granulomatous inflammatory pathology similar to TB, and observed a very similar pattern in gene-expression, miRNA expression and serum cytokine levels between the two diseases <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These data strongly suggest the presence of a major core pro-inflammatory pathway in TB and sarcoidosis, although also disease specific patterns could be distinguished marking TB and sarcoidosis. Thus there has been substantial success in identifying biomarkers associated with active TB.</p><p>Notwithstanding the value of these two genome wide gene expression studies reported recently, a major outstanding question is whether these signatures, captured mostly in EU and South African populations, also translate to populations and regions with a very different host genetic and TB epidemiological background. Our study addresses this issue directly by assessing unbiased whole genome expression profiles in Indonesia, an Asian country with the third highest TB prevalence worldwide. Specifically, we have examined gene expression patterns in PBMC from a longitudinal patient cohort during active TB, TB treatment and TB convalescence. Moreover, we replicated the findings in two independent model systems, a mouse <italic>M.tb</italic>-infection model and a mycobacterium-infected human macrophage cell line model. Although mouse models typically do not develop caseous necrotic lesions, the hallmark of human pulmonary TB <xref rid="pone.0045839-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, both mice and humans develop TB granulomas in the lung with activation of similar pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0045839-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and develop highly parallel innate and adaptive immune responses during <italic>M.tb</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Dharmadhikari1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our results validate and significantly extend the results available in the current literature, extend these to different ethnic and TB epidemiological settings, and further refine the pro-inflammatory biomarker signature associated with active TB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene Expression Profiles of Active TB Patients Versus Healthy Controls in a Longitudinal Patient Cohort from Indonesia</title><p>To identify molecular signatures involved in active TB, we applied microarray analysis to compare global gene expression in 23 patients with active TB (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 weeks), whilst they were undergoing treatment (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 weeks), and after they had completed the entire course of treatment (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28 weeks).

The most significant pathways were interferon mediated immunity, macrophage mediated immunity and cytokine and chemokine mediated signaling pathways. Further analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the TB patient study revealed that the type-1 interferon signaling activity was the predominant pathway up-regulated during active disease, and that there was concurrent down-regulation of interferon-gamma.

In a large human study using whole blood from active TB patients <italic>vs.</italic> uninfected controls, Berry <italic>et al</italic>., found an increase in type 1 IFN which was attributed predominantly to neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Here, however, we present highly similar findings in TB patients&#x02019; blood leucocytes, which were depleted of neutrophils through Ficoll density centrifugation, but still include monocyte/macrophages. The fact that the latter are the most likely source of this signature was supported by the finding of a similar signature in an independent, human macrophage cell line model of mycobacterial infection. Also in another study using whole blood to compare gene expression profiles in TB patients with active disease <italic>vs.</italic> individuals with latent <italic>M.tb</italic> infection several interferon inducible genes were found to be profoundly upregulated, including IFN-&#x003b1; protein 6 and 27 and ISG15 <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

IFN-&#x003b2; was found to have a similar effect <xref rid="pone.0045839-dePaus1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

It may be of interest to note that TLR8 is absent from mice, which could account for part of the differences in TB infection biology between humans and mice.</p><p>Further validation of our findings using qRT-PCR revealed that <italic>IL15RA</italic>, <italic>UBE2L6</italic> and <italic>GBP4</italic> were involved in this molecular signature in all three models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g006">
<bold>Figure 6</bold>
</xref>). <italic>IL15RA</italic> encodes for interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor alpha (IL-15R&#x003b1;), a common cytokine receptor expressed by macrophages that plays an important role in the development, survival, and proliferation of various immune cells (e.g. natural killer and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells). IL-15, which is co expressed with IL-15R&#x003b1; by antigen presenting cells allowing trans-production of cytokines to immune effector cells <xref rid="pone.0045839-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> is generally considered to be a regulator of T cell homeostasis as it cooperates with other cytokines like IL-2 and IL-7 to maintain pools of naive and memory T cell populations. Mortier <italic>et al</italic>., has described that IL-15R&#x003b1; expression on macrophages supports the early transition of antigen specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to memory cells <xref rid="pone.0045839-Mortier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As these processes are critical in the early immune response against microbial infections, and as data on the potential protective effects of IL-15 on murine experimental tuberculosis is starting to emerge, further studies are necessary in order to document the precise mechanism of action of IL-15-mediated type-I interferon signaling on <italic>M.tb</italic> survival and proliferation.</p><p>The second gene with consistent validation across the three TB models studied here, <italic>UBE2L6</italic>, is a member of the ubiquitin family of proteins. The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation, and recent work linking the ubiquitin family of proteins to type-I interferon mediated host immune responses is now beginning to emerge <xref rid="pone.0045839-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045839-Jeon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The third gene, <italic>GBP4,</italic> encodes Guanylate binding protein 4. With IFN-&#x003b1; being a main hypothesis in our study, it is reassuring that <italic>GBP4</italic> was commonly found in all 3 models, and indeed GBP4 displays a direct interaction with IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>). Type 1 and 2 IFNs have been shown to differentially regulate the <italic>GBP</italic> family of genes, and GBP4 is exclusively regulated by IFN-&#x003b1; production through macrophages <xref rid="pone.0045839-Decker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In our study a substantial number of overlapping genes were identified when comparing BCG infected human macrophage cells and circulating leucocytes from TB patients with active disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g003">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). The majority of these genes was present in the immune-mediated and host defense pathways. It needs to be highlighted that these genes were also common when the mouse TB infection model was compared to the data from the human models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g004">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). The genes overlapping in all three systems were further validated with qRT-PCR. The 15 genes that were successfully validated in the THP-1 cell line model by qRT-PCR completely overlapped with the 17 genes validated by qRT-PCR in the longitudinal patient cohort. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g006">
<bold>Figure</bold>
<bold>6</bold>
</xref>). This is not surprising since both models share a common human host background. The fact that only 3 genes were common to all three models may reflect important differences between the human and mouse models of TB. The PCR validation of these genes may represent an underestimate of the of the true array findings as the detection probes did not directly overlap with the array probes and so may not be able to confirm the specific RNA transcript identified by the array, particularly in the mouse to human comparisons. Although the use of BCG rather than <italic>M.tb</italic> in the THP-1 infection model may also have contributed to this relatively low number, it should be emphasized that the analysis focused only on those genes found in <underline>all</underline> three models, and that the variation between the <italic>M.tb</italic> infected human patients and the <italic>M.tb</italic> infected mice was significantly larger that that between the <italic>M.tb</italic> infected human patients and the BCG infected THP-1 cells. Our approach thus excludes the identification of genes based on only one individual model, and identifies genes only when they have been validated in three models, which is a significant advance compared to previous studies. In our study the mice were infected with <italic>M.tb</italic> intravenously, and it will be of interest to see whether infection via the aerosolic route, which is reflective of natural TB transmission, would have yielded similar response patterns. A cardinal feature of human TB is of central caseous necrosis in pulmonary granulomatous lesions, while such necrotic lesions are not seen in the mouse TB infected lung. Caseous necrosis is considered an essential step towards developing cavernous TB, in which phase <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli are released into the open airways prior to transmission. Thus, there are clear differences in the pathological manifestations of TB in human and mouse systems and this difference in disease pathology has been central to the argument that the mouse is an imperfect model for TB. However, notwithstanding these differences, we were able to observe consistent molecular signatures of active TB across the distinct models, thus supporting the general conclusion that mouse models are appropriate for studying certain aspects of the immune molecular host response to infection.</p><p>The use of TB patients cohorts, <italic>in vitro</italic> human macrophage cell lines and inbred mouse models of TB have provided new information which is in line with, but also significantly extends recent work from other groups <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the major role of dysregulated inflammation in general, and of strongly enhanced type 1 IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling in active TB disease. Importantly whereas this latter finding was originally attributed to the activity of neutrophils, we here find these same gene expression patterns also in cells devoid of neutrophils, such as PBMCs and macrophages. Finally, our study discovered genes commonly expressed in all three TB models we have studied, for example <italic>IL15RA</italic>, <italic>UBE2L6</italic> and <italic>GBP4</italic> which are all common to the IFN-&#x003b1; network. Future studies should extend this also to protein expression profiles to determine whether these differences are also present at the protein level. This will allow further insights into their possible function during TB disease and <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, and help to better delineate new TB biomarker signatures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, Jakarta, and by the Eijkman Institute Research Ethics Committee, Jakarta, and written consent was voluntarily signed by all patients and control subjects <xref rid="pone.0045839-Sahiratmadja1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Patient Recruitment</title><p>After informed consent, 23 new pulmonary tuberculosis patients above 15 years of age were recruited from an outpatient tuberculosis clinic in central Jakarta (Indonesia) <xref rid="pone.0045839-Sahiratmadja1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.
