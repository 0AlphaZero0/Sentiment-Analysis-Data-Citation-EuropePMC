Macrophages mount a complex immune response to the invading <italic>Mtb</italic>, but the pathogen is able to chronically reside and proliferate inside the host for extended period of time by manipulating microbicidal functions such as inhibition of phago-lysosome fusion, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide, and by rendering macrophages non-responsive to interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) <xref rid="pone.0050345-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Although, macrophages have long been regarded as the key phagocytic cells in mycobacterial infection <xref rid="pone.0050345-Sibille1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050345-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050345-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, there are increasing evidences showing protective role of neutrophils in tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0050345-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050345-BarriosPayan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> but the exact role of neutrophils in innate protection against mycobacteria is not fully understood. Evidences for the role of neutrophils in innate immunity to tuberculosis (TB) include the observations that during the early stages of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) migrate and accumulate at the site of infection <xref rid="pone.0050345-Appleberg2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050345-Pedrosa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the risk for TB infection diminish with increased neutrophil count, and killing of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG in a whole blood was significantly impaired by neutrophil depletion <xref rid="pone.0050345-Martineau1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in neutrophil serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase deficient mice <xref rid="pone.0050345-Steinwede1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

The role of neutrophils in TB is conceivable from the study showing that no granuloma formation was observed in PMN depleted mice up to 60 days of post infection with <italic>Mtb</italic>

However, only few data regarding bactericidal activities of neutrophil granular proteins toward mycobacteria are available. Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) <xref rid="pone.0050345-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050345-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050345-Sonawane1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> have been shown active against mycobacteria. The ability of macrophages to kill mycobacteria has been found increased by acquiring the proteins from other cells, for example, by delivery of granulysin from cytotoxic granules of T-lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0050345-Stenger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or myeloperoxidase from neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0050345-Heifets1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The intracellular growth characteristics of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and BCG have been well characterized in RAW 264.7 <xref rid="pone.0050345-Anes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and THP-1 cells <xref rid="pone.0050345-Ying1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, respectively. For this reason we chose these two models to evaluate the role of neutrophil granule proteins in mycobacteria killing. We found that azurophil granules are the granule type containing the proteins with most killing activity against mycobacteria. Electron microscopic studies revealed that azurophil granule proteins kill mycobacteria by disintegrating the cell morphology. Treatment of macrophages with azurophil granule proteins increased intracellular killing of mycobacteria and enhanced phago-lysosome fusion, but did not result in enhanced autophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Whole neutrophils-mediate killing of mycobacteria</title><p>We initiated our studies on the role of neutrophils in mycobacterial infection by characterizing the kinetics of mycobacterial survival in the presence of neutrophils.

Recent studies have shown that neutrophils may play a more important role in defense against mycobacterial infection than previously thought. Circulating neutrophils become activated and are recruited to lungs early in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Their role in host defense against <italic>Mtb</italic> is supported by studies showing that depletion of circulating neutrophils before i.v. challenge with <italic>M.tb</italic> compromises the immune response against mycobacterial infection <xref rid="pone.0050345-Fulton1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and induce granuloma formation <xref rid="pone.0050345-Seiler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Though neutrophils use both oxidative and non-oxidative microbicidal mechanisms to kill bacteria, human neutrophils seem to kill mycobacteria mainly through oxygen-independent mechanisms, since neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease are just as effective in killing mycobacteria as normal neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0050345-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Neutrophils contain many antimicrobial proteins stored in different granules, but no systematic and comparative studies have been done to identify the importance of different granules or granule proteins in killing of mycobacteria. In this study, we have purified neutrophil granules, identified the specific granular proteins responsible for the killing of pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria, and studied the mechanism by which addition of these granule proteins facilitated the intracellular killing of mycobacteria by macrophages. No significant differences in the killing kinetics of mycobacteria were observed in LPS-stimulated and non-stimulated neutrophils indicating that mycobacteria-associated protein(s) itself are sufficient to cause activation of neutrophils. This observation extends earlier finding that mycobacterial antigens can activate neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0050345-Suttmann1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and that mycobacteria can induce the release of cellular constituents during interaction with human neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0050345-May1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We found that AZP exhibit more potent mycobactericidal activity than to peroxidase-negative granule proteins and cytosolic proteins. Many bactericidal proteins are localized in the azurophil granules-for example azurocidin <xref rid="pone.0050345-Campanelli1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, defensins <xref rid="pone.0050345-Ganz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, lysozyme and serine proteases such as cathepsin G, proteinase 3, and elastase <xref rid="pone.0050345-Egesten1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These proteins have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity against a diverse group of microorganisms. Gel overlay assay of PN granules showed inhibition of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> growth by lactoferrin. Though the role of lactoferrin in enhancing the efficacy of BCG vaccine has been reported earlier <xref rid="pone.0050345-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, the direct antimycobacterial activity of lactoferrin has not yet been described in more detail. Lactoferrin being an iron-binding protein may inhibit mycobacterial growth by limiting the availability of iron, which is an essential component for growth and survival of mycobacteria. Together with AZP and PN granule proteins, calgranulin, the cationic calcium binding protein, was found to be the only cytosolic protein having antimycobacterial activity. Calgranulin shows sequence homology with cystic fibrosis antigen and the brain S 100 calcium binding protein, which have specific zinc binding sites <xref rid="pone.0050345-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As shown previously, the zinc-binding property of calprotectin may be responsible for the antimycobacterial activity, by depleting zinc required for the growth of mycobacteria <xref rid="pone.0050345-Sohnle1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The increased susceptibility of mycobacteria to AZP in the presence of &#x003b1;-defensins showed that defensins are key effector molecule for human resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic>. It has been proved that &#x003b1;-defensins such as human neutrophil peptides 1&#x02013;3 can kill <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0050345-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Altogether, these results provide evidence that neutrophils harbor a diverse arsenal of cytotoxic components against mycobacteria.</p><p>Pathogenic <italic>Mtb</italic> was found to be less susceptible to AZP than non-pathogenic strains. The decreased susceptibility could probably be due to differences in the cell wall architecture of pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria. It has been shown that the multilayered cell wall of pathogenic <italic>Mtb</italic> contains less number of transporters <xref rid="pone.0050345-Niederweis1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and that the lipoarabinomannan is capped with mannose. These along with other cell wall components insulate the bacteria from its environment and limit the binding and transport of drugs. Interestingly, pathogenic mycobacteria block the fusion of azurophil granules with the neutrophil phagosome <xref rid="pone.0050345-NDiaye1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our data demonstrate that by blocking fusion of azurophil granules with the phagosome, mycobacteria are not exposed to the most potent mycobactericidal neutrophil granule proteins.</p><p>We have previously found that addition of the antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, to macrophages enhances the mycobactericidal activity of these cells <xref rid="pone.0050345-Sonawane1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Consequently, we tested whether addition of AZP would enhance the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Indeed, addition of AZP to infected macrophages enhanced the intracellular killing of mycobacteria.</p><p>Autophagic pathways have been shown to enhance intra-phagosomal killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0050345-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and other studies <xref rid="pone.0050345-Yuk1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> have shown that cathelicidin is required for 1,25D3-induced autophagy activation in monocytes and macrophages and thereby increase killing of intracellular mycobacteria. However, AZP did not stimulate autophagy. Inhibition of phagolysosome fusion is an important mechanism for pathogenic mycobacteria to avoid killing by macrophages, and AZP treatment did increase co-localization of mycobacteria containing phagosome with lysosome. We hypothesize that these proteins may be endocytosed and then targeted directly to the maturation-arrested mycobacterial phagosome where the endocytosed proteins facilitate killing of the bacteria. Subsequently, the dead bacteria-containing phagosomes fuse with lysosomes. Indeed, we found that alexa fluor-labeled lysozyme was taken up to the endosomal compartment and localized with <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Another possible explanation could be that mycobacteria infection alters the host cell membrane resulting in exposure of negatively charged molecules that result in increase in binding of cationic core region of peptide facilitating the permeation of the peptide to reach its intracellular target.</p><p>Interestingly, when we compared the mycobactericidal activity of purified lysozyme and elastase, we found important differences. A higher concentration of lysozyme was needed to increase intracellular killing of mycobacteria in THP-1 cells than was needed for direct killing of mycobacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>. The reverse was true for elastase. This difference may either be due to the fact that elastase is more avidly taken up by the cells than lysozyme or that there is a greater synergistic effect of the mycobactericidal effect of elastase and other phagosomal components than is the case for lysozyme. The other possible explanation could be neutrophil elastase activate macrophages through TLR-4 <xref rid="pone.0050345-RibeiroGomes1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and induce microbicidal activity. Therapeutically, compounds are needed that kills surviving mycobacteria inside the macrophages. The data with lysozyme and elastase indicate that it is not enough to test the direct mycobactericidal activity of potential therapeutic compound it need to be supplemented with data how there compounds increase intracellular killing of mycobacteria in macrophages.</p><p>In summary, the current study provides evidence that neutrophils account as one of the innate anti-mycobacterial components in which azurophil granular proteins are more active against mycobacteria, ensuring initial protection from invading bacteria. Addition or induction of azurophilic proteins increases killing efficiency of macrophages by means of direct action or alternatively by facilitating ability of mycobacterial phagosomes to fuse with lysosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethic statement</title><p>All research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of the KIIT University, Lund University and the University of Copenhagen.
