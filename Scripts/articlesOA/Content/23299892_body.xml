Although it is a commensal organism, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can also cause mucosal and systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Despite the availability of novel classes of antifungal agents (e.g., azoles, echinocandins), mortality due to systemic candidiasis, the fourth most common form of sepsis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, reaches 37-44%<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.

Understanding the host defense pathways involved in candidiasis is therefore crucial for identifying novel targets for immunotherapy. To date, all investigations aimed at identifying antifungal host defense mechanisms in humans have relied on candidate-target approaches that are based on biologic plausibility of hypotheses extracted from <italic>in vitro</italic> or animal studies.

Measurements were performed at 4 and 24 hours. 693 transcripts that showed &#x0003e;2-fold higher expression compared to corresponding RPMI stimulation were selected (BH-adjusted P &#x0003c; 0.05). K-means analysis identified profile clusters that indicated shared and specific genes that were differentially expressed in response to each stimulus. We grouped shared genes into signatures representing common early response genes (clusters 1, 6, 14, 27), common late response genes (clusters 2, 3), and common inflammatory genes induced by all stimulations (clusters 9, 21, 25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>).</p><p id="P7">More importantly, to identify a set of discriminatory features (from the 693 differentially expressed transcripts) that would be most informative of the state of <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation and could distinguish <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation from the other inflammatory stimuli, we utilized information gain (Kullback-Leibler divergence/relative entropy) feature selection, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. We performed 10-fold cross-validation which stratifies the data into 10 random partitions in which each (in turn) is held out for testing and the remainder for training a Bayesian classifier.

This finding confirms that the <italic>C. albicans</italic>-specific genes we identified in our transcriptional arrays play an important role in host defense against systemic fungal infections. We also attempted to assess whether the polymorphisms in these genes also modified disease severity. However, only 51 patients fulfilled the criteria of severe candidiasis based on clinical scores and persistence of positive blood cultures, and this number was too low for allowing the identification of significant differences between genetic variation and disease severity (disseminated disease, persistent fungemia and mortality at 14 or 30 days) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Type I IFN SNPs modulate <italic>Candida</italic>-induced cytokine responses</title><p id="P9">In an additional approach to validate the role of the type I IFN pathway for host defense against <italic>Candida</italic>, we isolated PBMCs from an additional group of 74 healthy volunteers and stimulated the cells with the fungus.

Blocking of IFNAR did not influence the production of the monocyte-derived cytokines IL-&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Conversely, adding IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b2; to <italic>Candida</italic>-stimulated cells increased IFN-&#x003b3; production, while significantly decreasing IL-17 and IL-22 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).

In co-cultures of DCs and T-cells from CMC patients, this led to defective Th1 and Th17 responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). In order to validate the role of <italic>Candida</italic>-specific genes in human antifungal mucosal defense, we assessed the expression of these genes in cells from CMC patients.

The differential expression of 91 genes in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulation was compared between CMC patients and healthy controls (10 genes from the 101-gene signature characteristic for <italic>Candida</italic> were not considered: 7 because another isoform was already used for FPKM calculations, and 3 hypothetical proteins without concordant refseq genes). In cells from healthy controls, two genes showed downregulation (<italic>LFNG, RGC32</italic>), while all other genes were upregulated upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), validating the previous findings based on expression array analysis. In order to observe differences between patients and controls, the standardized fold change was used to create the respective heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The patients show a much lower standardized fold change in genes downstream of STAT1, again supporting the role of type 1 IFN pathway in CMC. We found 27 genes, from the set of 91 genes, to be significantly differently regulated upon <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation in patients compared to controls based on an ANOVA analysis (p-value interaction group and treatment &#x0003c;0.05) (MX1, OAS3, IFIT2, RTP4, XAF1, OAS2, IFI44, IFIH1, IFIT3, ADAR, PRIC285, FAM46A, SAMD9L, EIF2AK2, PARP12, TRIM22, ZBP1, HERC6, RSAD2, IFNG, OAS1, STAT2, DHX58, IRF7, TNFSF10, ISG15, HERC5).

However, most of this knowledge is based on <italic>in-vitro</italic> and animal studies; these studies led to hypotheses to be tested in human systems, leading to a somewhat biased view of human immunity against fungi. In the present study we have used a different approach based exclusively on complementary human studies: transcriptomics analysis in human primary cells, correlation of genetic variability and antifungal immunity in healthy volunteers (functional genomics), case-control association studies in patients with disseminated <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, and assessment of antifungal immunity in CMC patients.</p><p id="P15">In our initial approach, we designed a hypotheses-generating set of experiments by assessing the transcriptional profile induced in circulating primary leukocytes by <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Human primary PBMCs were stimulated either with <italic>C. albicans</italic> or with other inflammatory stimuli. Pathway analysis of the genes induced by <italic>Candida</italic> indicated two broad categories: (i) a first set of genes that was strongly induced and shared by both <italic>C. albicans</italic> and other inflammatory stimuli (LPS, MTB, or <italic>B. burgdorferi)</italic>, constituted expected pathways involved in inflammation and innate immunity, many of which have important roles in antifungal immunity<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and (ii) a feature set comprising an expression signature of 101 transcripts (95 genes) that distinguishes the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific response and is characterized by a strikingly strong and unanticipated type I IFN response.</p><p id="P16">Because the identification of the type I IFN pathway as the most prominent <italic>Candida</italic>-specific transcriptional signature was surprising, we initiated a series of studies to confirm this finding. Firstly, we assessed whether genetic polymorphisms in several of the genes identified in the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific dataset influenced susceptibility to systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infections. In a cohort of patients with candidemia that were genotyped using the Immunochip platform (Illumina<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>), on which 11 genes of the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific dataset were covered, we identified significant association of genetic variation with susceptibility to candidiasis in four of these genes: <italic>CCL8</italic> locus, <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>SP110</italic> locus, and <italic>PSMB8</italic> locus. This finding confirms that genes from the 101 <italic>Candida</italic>-specific dataset influence susceptibility to systemic fungal infections.</p><p id="P17">Secondly, the role of the type I IFN pathway for the anti-<italic>Candida</italic> immune response was subsequently validated in a study in which PBMCs isolated from a group of healthy volunteers were stimulated with the fungus. Genetic variation in the 11 type I IFN pathway genes present on the Immunochip was correlated with <italic>C. albicans</italic>-induced cytokine <bold>production</bold>. The correlation of cytokine concentrations with genotypes at tag SNPs of <italic>Candida</italic>-induced IFN pathway genes revealed significant associations at <italic>IRF1</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> regions, both crucial components of type I IFN pathway. We cannot exclude however that the effect of these polymorphisms on TNF&#x003b1; production are exerted through type II interferons; IFN&#x003b3; is stimulated by type I interferons<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and is known to induce TNF-&#x003b1; production<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. These data support the hypothesis of the specificity of the type I IFN pathway for <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation, as this association was significant only for cytokine production induced by <italic>Candida</italic>, but not by other stimuli.</p><p id="P18">Thirdly, we performed classical immunological studies to assess the role of type I IFNs for <italic>Candida</italic>-induced immune responses, and we demonstrated that type I IFNs induced by <italic>Candida</italic> modulate Th1/Th17 cytokine profiles; IFN&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b2; increased IFN&#x003b3; production, while decreasing IL-17 production. Moschen et al previously demonstrated that type I interferons decrease IL-17 production <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> TNF-&#x003b1; production did not seem to be influenced by blocking the IFNAR, suggesting that genetic effects in STAT1 exert their effect on TNF-&#x003b1; production either through direct intracellular pathways, or indirectly through IFN&#x003b3;. Interestingly <italic>C. albicans</italic> seems to induce only IFN-&#x003b2;, rather than IFN-&#x003b1;, consistent with earlier studies in mice<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Finally, using both qPCR and RNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrated that the expression of type I IFN pathway-induced genes was defective in CMC patients harboring a gain of function mutation in STAT1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These mutations lead to increased STAT1 phosphorylation and IFN&#x003b3; signaling. Liu et al demonstrated increased STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN&#x003b3; stimulation in U3C cells transfected with mutated STAT1<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. They hypothesize that IFN targeted genes can lead to decreased IL-17 production. However, freshly isolated PBMC from CMC patients do not produce any IFN&#x003b3; in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is more likely that the inability of mutated STAT1 to form heterodimers with STAT3 and STAT4 causes defective Th1/Th17 responses<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, which are likely to represent the main immunological defect in this disease. Additional defects in the expression of type I interferon-induced genes, as shown here, may also contribute to the increased susceptibility to mucosal fungal infections. Whether this is truly caused by a defect in STAT1-STAT2 heterodimerization remains to be demonstrated.</p><p id="P20">Taken together, these complementary studies represent a compelling body of evidence that the type I IFN pathway is an important component of the immune response during infections with <italic>C. albicans</italic> in humans. Moreover, the data presented here are supported by emerging information from murine studies. For example, Bourgeois <italic>et al.</italic> and Biondo <italic>et al.</italic> have reported that mouse conventional dendritic cells produce IFN-&#x003b2; upon stimulation with <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and have proposed a role for MyD88, TLR7 and TLR9 in this induction<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. On the other hand, these results are relatively surprising, as no earlier study has reported a role for type I IFNs in human antifungal host defense. In this respect, primary immunodeficiencies in type I IFN pathway are mainly associated with viral, rather than fungal, infections<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, our data suggest that type I IFN defects determine an increase susceptibility risk for fungal infections, as demonstrated here by the association with candidemia in risk groups, rather than an overt immunodeficiency associated with severe fungal infections.</p><p id="P21">The precise effect of type I IFNs for anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense is still being debated. One study in type I IFNAR knockout mice suggested a deleterious role for this pathway<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, whereas another study reported that IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice die from their inability to control fungal growth<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. While type I IFNs play an important role in the immune response against viral infections<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, they seem to be deleterious in bacterial infections<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In humans with <italic>Candida</italic> infections, the role of type 1 IFNs is not yet settled, although the defects seen in type I IFN gene expression in CMC patients, the susceptibility to candidemia by <italic>STAT1</italic> polymorphisms, and the potentiation of Th1 responses by type I IFNs, all suggest a beneficial effect of the type I IFN pathway in human antifungal host defense.</p><p id="P22">Although viruses have long been known to induce type I IFN production, other microorganisms have been recently reported to induce this pathway. MTB stimulation induces the expression of <italic>IFNB</italic> and <italic>IFNA1</italic> in human macrophages<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>; type I IFNs are required for caspase-1 activation during <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> infection<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> induces the transcription of <italic>IFNB</italic> in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, the complete transcriptional profile of the type I IFN pathway performed here shows important differences from the type I IFN profile induced by MTB <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and is significantly more pronounced for <italic>Candida</italic> than for MTB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).

Using this approach, we have confirmed the role of pathways known to be involved in antifungal host defense (e.g., common inflammatory pathways and the Th1/Th17 pathways) and we have identified a novel pathway (the type I IFN pathway).

Enrichment of mRNA was done using the MicroPoly(A)Purist Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Foster City, USA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, starting with 5&#x003bc;g of total RNA and using two rounds of Oligo(dT) selection. Whole transcriptome library preparation was performed using the SOLiD Total RNA-Seq Kit (STaR Kit, Life Technologies) and the corresponding low input amount protocol (version July 2011, Life Technologies). In brief, 25ng high quality poly(A) RNA was fragmented by RNAse III digestion, cleaned up using the PureLink RNA Micro Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and checked for quantity and size-distribution on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA adapters were hybridized and ligated to the fragmented RNA, followed by reverse transcription. After purification and size-selection of cDNA using Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent beads, the cDNA was amplified and used as input for the SOLiD system bead preparation using the SOLiD Easy bead system (E120 scale). Paired-end sequencing (50+25 bases) was performed on one flowcell of a 5500XL sequencer (Life Technologies) For each sample deep sequencing was performed resulting in a sequencing depth ranging from 75.6 million to 105.5 million paired-end reads. Paired-end colorspace reads were mapped against the human genome (hg19) using Tophat (version 1.4.1)<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. To increase mapping performance a GTF-file containing the exon boundries of all known RefSeq genes (25,024 genes) was supplied to Tophat and the insert size was set to 110 bases. For all genes FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) values were calculated using Cufflinks (version 2.0.0)<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Further statistical analyses was done using Partek&#x000ae; Genomic Suite software (version 6.6, build 6.12.0109, Partek Inc., St. Louis, USA). Fold changes and p-values were calculated for each gene by performing a multifactorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on log2 (with an offset of 1.0) transformed FPKM expression values. Factors included in the ANOVA model were group (patient or control), treatment (stimulation status), individual (data from same individual), and the interaction between group and treatment. Fold changes for the heatmaps were calculated for each individual by dividing the FPKM expression values of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulated sample by the unstimulated (RPMI) sample. Fold changes with values below 1 were replaced by the negative of the inverse. A gene list containing 101 differentially expressed transcripts known from the expression array was used to select genes for further downstream analysis. Of this list, 10 transcripts were not considered; 7 because another isoform was already used for FPKM calculations, and 3 hypothetical proteins without concordant refseq genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS425675-supplement-1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1259" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec>
