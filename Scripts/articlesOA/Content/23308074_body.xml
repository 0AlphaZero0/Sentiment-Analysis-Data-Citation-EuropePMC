The term &#x0201c;tubercle&#x0201d; refers to an original description by Sylvius (in 1650) of the apparent lung nodules characteristic of the &#x0201c;consumption&#x0201d; disease, which became christened as &#x0201c;tuberculosis (TB)&#x0201d; by Schonlein (in 1839) in recognition of its intricate correlation with these structures (Sakula, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">1982</xref>). Today, these tubercles are known as granulomas, defined as organized immune cell aggregates that form in response to persistent TB infection (Ramakrishnan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2012</xref>). The cellular composition of TB granulomas includes M&#x003d5;s, neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, B- and T-cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells (Russell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2007</xref>; Ramakrishnan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2012</xref>). Moreover, TB granulomas are characterized by a high-turnover rate of their M&#x003d5; population and by specialized differentiations taking place in mature M&#x003d5;s such as tightly interdigitated cell membranes that make M&#x003d5;s appear either epithelial (Adams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1974</xref>), fusion into multinucleated giant cells (Helming and Gordon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2007</xref>), or differentiation into foamy cells with a high lipid content (Russell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">2009</xref>). While granulomas have been studied for about 200&#x02009;years, their role in TB etiology remains unclear. In 1819, La&#x000eb;nnec first proposed granulomas as the cause of TB (Sakula, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">1982</xref>). Yet, about a century went by before Ghon correlated the presence of a single caseous granuloma in the mid-region of the lung with a corresponding nodal involvement (the Ghon complex) and the pathogen&#x02019;s dissemination, thus serving as a marker for latent TB (Dorhoi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2011</xref>). In spite of this, subsequent studies and clinical observations established the granuloma as a host-protective structure that &#x0201c;walls off&#x0201d; Mtb to prevent its dissemination, a notion that still predominates. Seminal studies by Ramakrishnan in zebrafish, however, have now evidenced mycobacteria actually exploit the granuloma into a tool for pathogenesis, suggesting its function can be modulated depending on the disease context (Ramakrishnan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2012</xref>). Considering TB is still one of the leading causes of human death due to a single infectious agent, substantial insights into microbe physiology and host defenses rest in the attempt to better understand the mechanisms governing TB granulomas.</p><p>Here, we will focus exclusively in the role of M&#x003d5; polarization in the formation and function of TB granulomas. Likewise, we will provide a unique perspective on the significance of B-cells, whose immune-modulatory function has long been ignored in TB.</p></sec><sec><title>Macrophage Polarization in TB Granulomas</title><p>M&#x003d5; polarization is broadly classified into M1 and M2 programs (Goerdt and Orfanos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1999</xref>; Gordon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2003</xref>; Mantovani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2004</xref>; Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2009</xref>). On one hand, the M1 program is a response to type-1 inflammatory conditions (e.g., IFN-&#x003b3;), often associated with intracellular pathogen resistance (Quintana-Murci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2007</xref>; Benoit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; is mainly responsible for the establishment of the M1 program, granting M&#x003d5;s the capacity to kill mycobacteria (Flynn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1993</xref>; Ehrt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>). The production of nitric oxide (NO) in M&#x003d5;s (characteristic in murine models) is arguably one of the most important consequences mediated by IFN-&#x003b3;, as mice deficient for NO production succumb to Mtb infection (Chan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1992</xref>). In fact, the enzyme iNOS (inducible NO synthase) required for NO production is a bona fide marker of murine M1 M&#x003d5;s (Xie and Nathan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">1993</xref>). Other marker genes, whose expression is induced in M1, include <italic>ido1, ptgs2, il12b/il23a, socs3, marco, cd86, irf3/irf5</italic>, and <italic>stat1/stat5</italic>, among others (Lawrence and Natoli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2011</xref>; Murray and Wynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2011b</xref>). Collectively, the M1 program is part of the &#x0201c;common host response&#x0201d; against intracellular bacteria that endows M&#x003d5;s with a non-permissible nature (Ehrt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>; Deretic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004</xref>; Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2009</xref>; Cairo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2011</xref>; Murray and Wynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2011a</xref>). On the other hand, the M2 program is dictated by type-2 inflammatory signals (e.g., IL-4, IL-10), enabling M&#x003d5;s to participate in the suppression of inflammation, phagocytosis, tissue remodeling, and repair, among others (Sica et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2008</xref>; Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2009</xref>; Murray and Wynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2011a</xref>). However, this program also renders M&#x003d5;s poorly microbicidal against intracellular pathogens (Raju et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">2008</xref>; Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2009</xref>). This is best illustrated by how the arginine metabolism is used in M2 M&#x003d5;s, which shuts down NO production in favor of tissue reparation (Shearer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">1997</xref>). Indeed, M2 polarization is accompanied by ARG1 (type-1 arginase) expression that inhibits NO production by outcompeting iNOS to convert arginine into ornithine and urea (Munder et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">1998</xref>; El Kasmi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2008</xref>). Along arg1, other M2 marker genes include <italic>fizz1, chi311/chi312/chi313, mrc1, cd36, socs2, il-10, klf4, jmjd3/irf4, ppar&#x003b3;</italic>, and <italic>stat6</italic>, among others (Lawrence and Natoli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2011</xref>; Murray and Wynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2011b</xref>). Altogether, Mtb might influence the granuloma function by controlling M&#x003d5; polarization, a premise that is presciently in line with the following findings, which for the purpose of conciseness, are mainly based on the use of the iNOS/ARG1 polarization axis.</p><p>The animal models to study TB granulomas are discussed in detail elsewhere (Flynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>). Here, we highlight recent findings in mice and zebrafish documenting the TB granuloma dynamics, supported by studies and clinical observations done in TB patients. It is widely postulated the onset of human pulmonary TB begins when inhaled Mtb is captured by M&#x003d5;s and transported across the alveolar epithelium into the lung tissue. In zebrafish, the subsequent steps leading to a nascent granuloma have been captured in real-time imaging (Davis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2002</xref>). While infected M&#x003d5;s undergo apoptosis, they promote the recruitment of phagocytes, which upon arrival, display high motility conducive for scavenging apoptotic cells. The phagocytosis of dead M&#x003d5;s leads to the formation of cell aggregates, fomenting bacterial growth. Subsequent rounds of this cycle promote the formation of a stable granuloma in 3&#x02009;days post-infection (<italic>p.i</italic>.), a process that is dependent on the region of difference-1 (RD1) virulence locus of <italic>M. marinum</italic> and independent of T-cells (Davis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2002</xref>; Volkman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">2010</xref>; Davis and Ramakrishnan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>). It is unclear whether zebrafish M&#x003d5;s undergo polarization. Yet, since most transcription factors governing T-cell polarization are highly conserved in zebrafish (Mitra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2010</xref>), along with physiological and pathological responses characteristic of type-1 and type-2 immunity (Aggad et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010</xref>; Balla et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>; Holt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2011</xref>; Wittamer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">2011</xref>; Renshaw and Trede, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">2012</xref>), it seems as a matter of time before M&#x003d5; polarization is identified and characterized in this teleost. By contrast, the early stage of Mtb infection in mice is marked by M1 M&#x003d5; polarization, reminiscent of clinical observations in TB patients (Benoit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>). In fact, transcriptomic analysis of infected murine M&#x003d5;s revealed the gene modulation provoked by Mtb overlaps with that of IFN-&#x003b3; to establish the M1 program (Ehrt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>). Type-1 inflammatory signals secreted by infected M&#x003d5;s induce cell recruitment and formation of primary granulomas. Unlike zebrafish, however, granuloma formation in mice takes up to 3&#x02009;weeks when <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> reaches a plateau and coincides with adaptive immunity involvement. For instance, nascent liver granulomas were visualized by intravital microscopy between 2 and 3&#x02009;weeks after <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> Calmette&#x02013;Guerin (BCG) challenge (Egen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2011</xref>). In another study, Mtb infection did not change the murine M&#x003d5; population (iNOS<sup>low</sup>ARG1<sup>low</sup>) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the first week (Redente et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2010</xref>). At day 21 <italic>p.i</italic>., however, M1 M&#x003d5;s (iNOS<sup>high</sup>ARG1<sup>low</sup>) dominated in BAL and granulomas, coinciding with a peak of IFN-&#x003b3; in infected lungs (Redente et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2010</xref>). In humans, although NO production by monocyte-derived M&#x003d5;s remains controversial, both iNOS and NO are detected in granulomas and alleles for NOS2 are associated to TB susceptibility (Nicholson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">1996</xref>; Facchetti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1999</xref>; Choi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2002</xref>; Schon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">2004</xref>; Moller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2009</xref>). After 35&#x02013;60&#x02009;days <italic>p.i</italic>., while murine M&#x003d5;s at the granuloma core remained iNOS<sup>high</sup>ARG1<sup>low</sup>, there was a dramatic shift toward the M2 program (iNOS<sup>low</sup>ARG1<sup>high</sup>) in M&#x003d5;s surrounding the core, accompanied by elevated type-2 inflammatory signals (Redente et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2010</xref>). This is in line with ARG1 detection in human TB granulomas (Pessanha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">2012</xref>).</p><p>The shift toward M2 M&#x003d5;s during Mtb infection could have deleterious consequences for the granuloma as a host-protective structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). First, ARG1 expression in uninfected M&#x003d5;s surrounding the granuloma core suggests the development of an immunosuppressive niche. Indeed, Mtb promotes its survival by inducing ARG1 expression through MyD88-dependent signaling pathways (El Kasmi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2008</xref>; Qualls et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2010</xref>). At the transcriptome level, murine M2 M&#x003d5;s displayed a diminished inflammatory response to Mtb as reflected by a reduced NO production and increased of iron availability, alluding ARG1 might also be implicated in nutrient deprivation mechanisms limiting microbial growth (Forbes and Gros, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2001</xref>; Kahnert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2006</xref>; Cairo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2011</xref>). Furthermore, M1 M&#x003d5;s possess a &#x0201c;fail-safe&#x0201d; system sustaining optimum NO production based on citrulline recycling via argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), which is absent in M2 M&#x003d5;s (Qualls et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">2012</xref>). Given the restrictive granuloma environment where arginine may be limited, the presence of this fail-safe system may become further accentuated. Second, M2 M&#x003d5;s may represent a transitional state into the formation of &#x0201c;foamy&#x0201d; M&#x003d5;s that are rich in cholesterol, a carbon source for microbial intracellular survival (Pandey and Sassetti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">2008</xref>; Peyron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">2008</xref>; Russell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">2009</xref>; Griffin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2011</xref>). Recently, Mtb lipids were shown to trigger PPAR&#x003b3;, the master regulator of M2 polarization, to increase expression of CD36 and induce foam cell formation (Mahajan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2012</xref>). Here, we postulate that factors governing M2 polarization establish additional anti-inflammatory signaling loops, like that of CD36, to increase microbial fitness within granulomas (Kuda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2011</xref>). Third, the shift toward M2 M&#x003d5;s may allow Mtb to control the antigen-presentation process to undermine adaptive immunity within granulomas (Benoit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>). Indeed, TB granulomas display a limited antigen-presentation to evoke significant T-cell responses (Egen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2011</xref>). While M&#x003d5; polarization was not addressed in this study, M2 M&#x003d5;s do inhibit the proliferation of CD4 T-cells while fomenting the activity of regulatory T-cells (Schebesch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">1997</xref>; Curiel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>; Biswas and Mantovani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2010</xref>). Altogether, the shift toward M2 M&#x003d5;s might also occur in human granulomas and contribute to Mtb pathogenesis given that TB susceptibility is often accompanied by elevated type-2 inflammatory and immunosuppressant signals (Kahnert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2006</xref>; Raju et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">2008</xref>; Almeida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2009</xref>; Schreiber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">2009</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A model illustrating the putative roles of M&#x003d5; polarization and B-cell involvement during the formation and function of TB granulomas</bold>. TB granuloma M&#x003d5;s undergo various specialized transformations: they can look like epithelial characterized by tightly interdigitated cell membranes that link adjacent cells; they can fuse into multinucleated giant cells; or they can differentiate into foamy cells with a high content of intracellular lipids. While none of these specialized transformations in the granuloma M&#x003d5; population are well understood, we propose they might be reflection of the M&#x003d5; polarization status that may render the granuloma structure with a microbicidal capacity (top) or as a tool of pathogenesis (bottom). In the former scenario, the local M&#x003d5; population in lung undergoes a M1 polarization early on during Mtb infection and granuloma formation, distinguished by a cell-surface receptor repertoire responsive to pro-inflammatory signaling (e.g., IFN-&#x003b3;R<sup>high</sup>) and conducive for antigen-presentation (e.g., MHC-II<sup>high</sup>, CD86<sup>high</sup>), while acquiring a microbicidal capacity reflected in the NO production (e.g., <italic>iNOS</italic><sup>high</sup>, ASS1<sup>positive</sup>), among others. These M&#x003d5;s have been noted to be most frequently located in the necrotic center of a mature tuberculous granuloma where apoptotic and necrotic M&#x003d5;s are abundant along with extracellular bacteria. Accompanying the M1 M&#x003d5; polarization is the recruitment of neutrophils and Th1 cells, whose migration and activation status might be influenced by a B-cell involvement likely characterized by a pro-inflammatory phenotype (e.g., IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>high</sup> IL-6<sup>high</sup> IgG<sup>high</sup>). In the latter scenario, we propose a change in the TB granuloma environment during the late stages of Mtb infection, distinguished by the M2 M&#x003d5; polarization driven by the high expression of transcription factors (e.g., PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>high</sup>, STAT6<sup>positive</sup>) antagonistic for type-1 inflammation, and characterized by a cell-surface receptor repertoire promoting tissue repair activities (e.g., IL-4R<sup>high</sup>) and the formation of foamy cells (e.g., CD36<sup>high</sup>), while suppressing the microbicidal functions like NO production (e.g., ARG1<sup>high</sup>), among others. We envision M2 M&#x003d5; polarization might give rise to the formation of foam and multinucleated giant cells, whose presence is noted to be most frequently at the rim and center of mature TB granulomas, and which may favor the intracellular resilience of Mtb. Furthermore, classical M2 M&#x003d5;s have been noted to be most frequently located surrounding the granuloma center and overwhelmingly in the local lung environment. Along with the M2 M&#x003d5; polarization is the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment while enhancing that of T<sub>regs</sub>, activities that might be influenced by a B-cell involvement likely characterized by a anti-inflammatory phenotype (e.g., IL-10<sup>high</sup>, CD1d<sup>positive</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-03-00405-g001"/></fig><p>In the near future, we envision the role of M&#x003d5; polarization in the granuloma context will be tested directly in different ways. First, we expect further advances in real-time imaging in both zebrafish and mouse models. Highly conserved M&#x003d5; polarization markers are ideal candidates for the development of novel animal reporter lines expressing different fluorochromes to target the different M&#x003d5; subsets. Second, specific gene inactivation of M&#x003d5; polarization markers with the use of morpholinos (in zebrafish), siRNA-based technology, or gene-knockout strategy (including conditional strategies), may be used at different stages of granuloma formation in animal models. The strategies above could be used in combination with global array-based transcriptomics and proteomics approaches in order to assess the granuloma and local lung environment in the presence or absence of M&#x003d5; subsets. Collectively, we expect there would be more future efforts to bridge results obtained in animals into the human context as discussed in the conclusion section.</p></sec><sec><title>A Role for B-Cells in Granulomatous Diseases</title><p>Alterations in the lung environment by Mtb and/or subsequent immune responses likely affect the infection outcome. None of these is more apparent than the type-1 inflammatory storm that is unleashed in murine lungs at 3&#x02009;week <italic>p.i</italic>., when a peak of IFN-&#x003b3;/TNF coincides with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell involvement, an event that impacts the organization of nascent granuloma structures. Yet, mice in which CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells are unable to produce IFN-&#x003b3;/TNF are still resistant to TB, suggesting a complex scenario for protection (Torrado and Cooper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">2011</xref>). In this perspective article, we propose that, beside T-cells, B-cells modulate the TB granuloma formation and function through interaction with their cellular components.</p><p>Despite extensive evidence for anti-Mtb antibody production in TB patients (Kunnath-Velayudhan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2012</xref>), and a higher susceptibility of pIgR (IgA receptor)-deficient mice (Tjarnlund et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">2006</xref>), initial studies examining the role of antibodies in TB indicated a modest impact in protective immunity, with benefits limited to passive administration of anti-Mtb antibodies (Glatman-Freedman and Casadevall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">1998</xref>; Roy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2005</xref>; Abebe and Bjune, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2009</xref>). This contributed to the notion B-cells played a minor role in TB immunity, if any. Yet, recent studies now provide compelling reasons to revisit the role of B-cells in TB (Cooper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>; Maglione and Chan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2009</xref>; Flynn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2011</xref>; Philips and Ernst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2012</xref>). First, B-cells infiltrate the lungs of Mtb-infected mice and humans (Tsai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">2006</xref>), where they organize in ectopic B-cell follicles at the periphery of granulomas (Gonzalez-Juarrero et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2001</xref>; Ulrichs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">2004</xref>; Kahnert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2007</xref>; Maglione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2007</xref>). These foci are the predominant sites of cellular proliferation in the infected lungs attesting to the importance of B-cells in shaping the local environment during infection (Ulrichs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">2004</xref>). Moreover, B-cells also infiltrate the granuloma structure, as shown in non-human primates where activated B-cell clusters are found in close contact with T-cells (Phuah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">2012</xref>), and in the lungs from cattle with natural tuberculosis (Beytut, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2011</xref>). Mtb-specific B-cells also exist at local sites of infection in pleural fluids, a strategic place to influence the immunity against Mtb (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2011</xref>). Beyond TB, B-cells are well-known cellular components in several other granulomatous diseases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Not only B-cells are present in granuloma but also they could be important for their maturation. This is suggested in pristane induced oil granuloma formation (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2010</xref>) and during <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> infection (Ji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2008</xref>) where the absence of B-cells results in a marked delay in granuloma formation. In the context of the TB, although granulomas form in the absence of B-cells, their numbers and size remain lower and they hardly become inflammatory (Bosio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2000</xref>; Maglione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2007</xref>). This could be the result of the well-known ability of B-cells to contribute to the organization of secondary and tertiary lymphoid organs (Moseman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2012</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characteristics of B-cells identified in non-TB granulomatous diseases</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disease or model</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of B-cells</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reported role in disease</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specie</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wegener&#x02019;s granuloma</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Undefined</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Detrimental</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Humans</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Voswinkel et al.

However, other granulomatous diseases were successfully treated with rituximab (Donvik and Omdal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2011</xref>; Holle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2012</xref>), cautioning B-cells may be detrimental depending on the disease context. Finally, beyond antibody production, B-cells display diverse roles in the immunity against multiple pathogens that could operate during TB. In this regard, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, though not occasioning granuloma formation, represents a paradigm for antibody-independent roles of B-cells against an intracellular bacterium with the evidence that B-cells producing IL-10 (B<sub>regs</sub>) impairs the control of natural and vaccine-induced immunity to <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Neves et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2010</xref>). Since this role cannot simply be recapitulated in animal models lacking B-cells (Mastroeni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2000</xref>; Mittrucker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2000</xref>), this exemplifies how deletion of the B-cell compartment eclipses specific functions of these cells.</p><p>B-cells express adaptive and innate receptors to recognize pathogens (Blumenthal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2009</xref>; Rawlings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2012</xref>). Beyond antibody production, B-cells secrete various signals including cytokines, and serve as antigen-presenting cells (Rawlings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2012</xref>). These immune-modulatory functions are performed by different B-cell subsets depending on their differentiation program (e.g., B1, B2), activation status (e.g., na&#x000ef;ve, effector, memory), tissue distribution, the timing of the immune response, or disease context. From this perspective, the identity of B-cells infiltrating the lungs of TB patients or animals remains relatively unknown. In most cases, these cells (likely B2-cells) have undergone class switch recombination and produce antibodies (Phuah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">2012</xref>). However, CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1d<sup>+</sup> B1-cells are also observed predominantly in TB patients (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">2012</xref>) and in mouse models of TB and other granulomatous diseases (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2005</xref>; Popi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2008</xref>; Ronet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">2010</xref>). Regardless of their identity or individual contribution, we estimate the B-cell compartment influences the TB granuloma formation and function through interaction with M&#x003d5;s, T-cells, and neutrophils (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>As B-cells interact with M&#x003d5;s in TB granulomas (Tsai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">2006</xref>; Chakravarty et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2008</xref>), they might affect M&#x003d5; polarization within these structures. A case in point, B1-cells differentiate M2 M&#x003d5;s via IL-10 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a tumor model (Wong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">2010</xref>). However, mice deficient for B1-cells (xid model) displayed rather a susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, accompanied by increased levels of IL-10 (Junqueira-Kipnis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2005</xref>; Russo and Mariano, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">2010</xref>). Certainly, there are other B-cell subsets that could compensate as the <italic>in vivo</italic> source of IL-10, like B<sub>regs</sub> (O&#x02019;Garra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">1990</xref>; Lampropoulou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2008</xref>). Likewise, there exist alternative <italic>in vivo</italic> immunosuppressive mechanisms driven by B-cells other than the B1-cell subset, as demonstrated for IgG production favoring FcR-mediated M2 M&#x003d5; polarization in a carcinoma model (Andreu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). In line with this observation, FC&#x003b3;RIIB-deficient M&#x003d5;s displayed a M1 M&#x003d5; phenotype upon Mtb infection, express less IL-10 and better control the infection (Maglione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2008</xref>). Since the phenotype manifests after 3&#x02009;weeks of infection, IgG-producing B2-cells produced during the course of the adaptive immune response might be involved. B1 cells might rather contribute to M2 polarization through Fc&#x003b3;R-independent IL-10-dependant mechanisms. Whether these events occur within the granuloma is currently unknown. Collectively, these studies infer a B-cell contribution to an immunosuppressive niche within TB granulomas by tilting M&#x003d5;s toward the M2 program.</p><p>If M&#x003d5;s are the main components in nascent TB granulomas, then CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells are perhaps the most critical component of stable TB granulomas as shown by the re-awakening of latent TB in HIV-1 co-infected patients. In recent years, multiple studies suggest an immune-modulatory role for B-cells in T-cell activity at the granuloma level. On one hand, B-cells can co-localize with T-cells in TB granulomas (Ulrichs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">2004</xref>; Beytut, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2011</xref>), and directly interact with them in the granulomas caused by <italic>Leishmania</italic> (Moore et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2012</xref>). On the other hand, B-cells influence T-cell effector functions either through cytokine production or antigen-presentation (Lund and Randall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2010</xref>). In TB context, IL-10 derived from B1-cells controls the homeostasis of T-helper-17 (Th17), essential for anti-microbial immunity at epithelial/mucosal barriers (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">2012</xref>). Reciprocally, Th-17-associated cytokines promote the formation of B-cell foci in Mtb-infected mice, and correlate with B-cell infiltration in TB patients (Khader et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">2011</xref>). In the mouse model, IL-17A (Okamoto Yoshida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">2010</xref>) or IL-23-deficient (Khader et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">2011</xref>) animals have marked defects in the formation of granulomas and/or B-cell follicles. In addition IL-23-deficient mice also have poor levels of IL-17 and IL-22. These deficiencies resulted in a marked alteration of CXCL13 production, the chemokine responsible for B-cell recruitment and follicle formation (Khader et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">2011</xref>). It is not known if IL-10 production by B-cells is at the initiation or a secondary consequence of the alterations in IL-17 levels. These observations might provide an explanation for the links reported in TB patients between Th17 and formation of B-cell foci and IL-10 (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">2012</xref>).</p><p>Evidence obtained in non-TB diseases argue B-cells favor Th1 polarization (involved in TB protective immunity) through IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; production during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, or promote Th2 differentiation (thought to be detrimental during TB) through either IL-2 (Wojciechowski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">2009</xref>) or IL-10 (Ferru et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1998</xref>; Popi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2008</xref>; Ronet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">2010</xref>) in the control of different parasites. Conversely, B-cells also suppress T-cell activity as best illustrated in mice with a targeted deletion of MyD88 in B-cells during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (Neves et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2010</xref>). Finally, evidencing the role of B-cells as antigen-presenting cells, mice with a targeted deletion of MHC-II in B-cells displayed a reduction of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; by CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T-cells during <italic>Salmonella</italic> challenge (Barr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2010</xref>), and low pulmonary Th1 cell counts during <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection (Lund and Randall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2010</xref>).</p><p>Another cell influencing TB granuloma formation is the neutrophil, whose migration can be controlled by B-cells. During <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, mice with a targeted deletion of MyD88 in B-cells exhibited an accumulation of neutrophils in the spleen, an effect that likely depends on B<sub>regs</sub>-mediated IL-10 production (Neves et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2010</xref>). In the context of mycobacterial infections, aberrant neutrophil migration is known to have deleterious effects in host tissue integrity (Eruslanov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2005</xref>; Berry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2010</xref>). In mice deficient for the B-cell compartment (Maglione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2007</xref>), Mtb infection leads to an uncontrolled accumulation of pulmonary neutrophils, an observation also supported by the excessive neutrophil migration in the peritoneum after BCG-vaccination (Kondratieva et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2010</xref>). These examples highlight the importance of tolerance mechanisms in TB.</p><p>Based on the above observation, it is tempting to propose that B-cell could act at different levels during TB such as during granuloma progression and by influencing the effector function of third-party cells like M&#x003d5;s. To directly examine this, studying B-cell contribution through comparison of B-cell-competent vs. B-cell-deficient animals should now be further complemented by studies examining the direct response of B-cells to Mtb infection, and through analyses in animal models lacking specific pathways in B-cells and biological consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Among trends emerging in TB etiology, the notion that the local lung environment shifts from a host-protective nature toward one favorable to microbial resilience is discussed here at the granuloma level and in the context of M&#x003d5; polarization and B-cell function (see also an illustration in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Exploring these issues will likely bring us closer to uncover the enigma concealed by TB granulomas. One can envisage that studies investigating the role of genes involved in host tolerance (Medzhitov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2012</xref>) might be a good way to explore these aspects of the disease. Although in humans this could be limited to immunogenetic studies, more mechanistic studies could be conducted in animal models where selective inactivation of those genes could provide new insights on the consequences on the pathology. These studies could go along with more sophisticated approaches based on single cell analysis such as those involving laser microdissection or more global phenotypic signatures obtained from mass cytometry, in order to further identify cell subsets involved at different stages of granuloma formation and TB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec>
