<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) is known to be influenced by both genetic variation and nature of immune response <xref rid="pone.0062751-Behr1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Increased pulmonary lymphocyte infiltration following <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) infection is a crucial event leading to the generation of anti-mycobacterial immunity. Recent observations indicate that <italic>Mtb</italic> induces neogenesis of lymphoid structures (LS) in infected lungs <xref rid="pone.0062751-Kahnert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. LS are defined as ectopic lymphoid-cell accumulations that arise in non lymphoid tissues under inflammatory conditions and tightly resemble an inducible form of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, where local immune responses occur <xref rid="pone.0062751-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The formation and the maintenance of LS in chronic inflammatory conditions is critically dependent on lymphoid chemokines such as CCL19 and CXCL12 <xref rid="pone.0062751-Corsiero1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although studies in LT&#x003b1;-deficient mice have suggested a role for LS in the development of acquired resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, their function during TB remains unclear <xref rid="pone.0062751-Kashino1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Both innate and adaptive responses concur to generate anti-mycobacterial immunity preventing TB and are dependent on the development of granulomas <xref rid="pone.0062751-Huynh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Dorhoi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Granuloma formation occurs upon pulmonary inflammation due to dynamic interaction of bacilli with macrophages and the succeeding/following recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells (DC), T and B cells <xref rid="pone.0062751-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Herein, interactions between innate and adaptive immune components occur at the interface between the macrophage-rich inner layer and the surrounding outer layer enriched predominantly with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or in follicle-like structures <xref rid="pone.0062751-Egen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, the composition of immune infiltrates in granuloma lesions may be associated with either replication of mycobacteria during active TB, or, on the contrary, with growth control in the case of latent TB <xref rid="pone.0062751-Gideon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, understanding the specific contribution of lung immune infiltrates to the generation of anti-mycobacterial immunity will provide a better knowledge of TB immunobiology facilitating the design of new therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8) is a lineage-specific transcription factor of myeloid cells playing a critical role in both innate and acquired immunity <xref rid="pone.0062751-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Gabriele1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Tailor1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is expressed at high levels in some DC subsets and to a lesser extent in other immune cells, including granulocytes, thus controlling their functional development <xref rid="pone.0062751-Schiavoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Mice lacking IRF-8 (IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) display multiple alterations of the myeloid compartment, including defective differentiation of plasmacytoid DC and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC and systemic expansion of granulocytes <xref rid="pone.0062751-Schiavoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Mattei1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Holtschke1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Consequently, IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are highly susceptible to most infectious agents, whose clearance depends on the induction of a competent Th1 immune response <xref rid="pone.0062751-Turcotte1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Giese1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. BXH-2 mice, which bear a defective IRF-8R394C allele, are extremely susceptible to <italic>M. bovis</italic> Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) and <italic>Mtb</italic> infections <xref rid="pone.0062751-Turcotte2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Specifically, BXH-2 mice cannot contain aerosol <italic>Mtb</italic> infection due to inability of macrophages to limit bacterial replication <xref rid="pone.0062751-Marquis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Recently, IRF-8 deficiency has been described as the cause of a new syndrome in humans affecting monocytes/DC cell content and BCG susceptibility <xref rid="pone.0062751-Hambleton1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we investigated the immune events controlled by IRF-8 at pulmonary level in host defense against TB. We show that fatal acute TB occurring in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice following aerosol <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is associated to uncontrolled growth of pulmonary granulomas and impaired development of LS. These events are correlated with a progressive decrease of infiltrating T cells and a persistence of neutrophils associated to unbalanced expression of lymphoid chemokines at late stages of infection. Our results reveal a new important function of IRF8 as a regulator of pulmonary immune dynamics required to elicit a protective anti-mycobacterial immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Mice were maintained and treated in accordance with Legislative Decree 116/92 guidelines based on European Directive 86/609/EEC.

Lung sections (3 &#x003bc;m thick) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were mounted on positively charged Superfrost slides (Fisher Scientific). Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols. Antigens were retrieved by a high-temperature heating method. Briefly, slides were immersed in target retrieval solution at pH 6 (Dako), in a steamer (90&#x02013;95&#x000b0;C) for a 20-minute incubation for all antigens. Tissues were then blocked for endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide in water. Slides were then incubated in PBS containing 2% BSA, stabilizing protein and 0.015 mol/L sodium azide (Protein Block Serum-Free, Dako) to prevent non-specific binding. Tissues were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with primary mAbs, followed by secondary Ab for 1 h at r.t.

To better analyze the cellular organization of LS we performed double staining for F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062751-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). We found a comparable infiltration of CD3<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as similar levels of F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the areas surrounding vessels and bronchial tree in both IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT-B6 lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062751-g005">Fig. 5E, F, G</xref>).

Indeed, the importance of IRF-8 in immunity against mycobacteria was already revealed by previous studies identifying this factor as a critical regulator of host defenses against BCG and, in some settings, against <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0062751-Fortin1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

In this study we have extended these observations by dissecting the immune components occurring in lungs of IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice following <italic>Mtb</italic> aerogenic infection. We report three crucial events characterizing <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that result in fatal acute TB: i) an uncontrolled growth and disorganized structure of granulomas distinguished by altered immune infiltration and progressive loss of T lymphocytes leading to the inability to immunologically restrain bacterial replication at late stages; ii) an impaired development of pulmonary LS associated with the failure to maintain a proper T cell recruitment within these structures, underlying the importance of these components for TB progression; iii) a persistent homing of neutrophils into both LS and fast-growing granulomas, suggesting their crucial contribution to the development of acute TB.</p><p>It is generally accepted that immune responses at the infection site reflect immunity in the periphery concurring to TB control <xref rid="pone.0062751-KunnathVelayudhan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. About 2&#x02013;3 weeks p.i. as T lymphocytes are recruited in granulomas, adaptive immunity is generated as a result of multiple factors, including type and abundance of DC, which determine the strength and persistence of immune response <xref rid="pone.0062751-Yoshikai1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. If these events fail to occur, <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immune response is not established, causing disease progression <xref rid="pone.0062751-Dorhoi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Protective immune responses can be generated independently of secondary lymphoid organs during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and implicate local pulmonary T-cell priming as a crucial mechanism for host defense onset <xref rid="pone.0062751-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this regard, in both humans and mice, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection has been associated with the neogenesis of pulmonary LS <xref rid="pone.0062751-Kahnert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Ulrichs1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Some studies reported that granulomas ensuing from <italic>Mtb</italic> infection also contain lymphoid areas resembling a form of neo-generated LS <xref rid="pone.0062751-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Maglione1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Our data show that truthful organization of granulomas and pulmonary LS are processes tightly controlled by IRF-8, since they occur properly in lungs of <italic>Mtb-</italic>infected immunocompetent but not in IRF-8-deficient mice. As a consequence, IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were found to be extremely susceptible to aerosol infection with low-dose <italic>Mtb</italic> Erdman strain, succumbing to fatal acute TB within day 40 p.i., whereas the immunocompetent animals contained the infection switching from acute to chronic TB. We demonstrate that the breakpoint at which the course of TB diverges in the two strains of mice is 15 days p.i., when the onset of adaptive immunity is expected to occur <xref rid="pone.0062751-Urdahl1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and this event is unrelated to the early pulmonary recruitment of key innate immune populations. In fact, up to day 15 p.i., bacterial growth and dissemination in lungs and spleens were comparable in both animals. However, by this time point a different balance of immune cell subsets already existed between lungs of IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT-B6 mice. In particular, with respect to WT-B6 mice, IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals exhibited a more marked neutrophil accumulation in lungs predictive of acute inflammation <xref rid="pone.0062751-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed percentages of pulmonary macrophages, DC, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells substantially similar to those of WT-B6 mice, suggesting an accelerated and compensatory pulmonary recruitment of these populations at early stage of infection in deficient animals. The concomitant decrease of Treg cells suggests the prevalence of traits predisposing to exuberant inflammatory response more than immune protection in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lungs <xref rid="pone.0062751-Huynh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Importantly, the unbalanced presence of certain immune cells in the lungs of IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice differently reflects their distribution within LS and granulomas throughout TB. At day 15 p.i. efficient recruitment of multiple populations, including macrophages, DC, FDC, B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes occurred within LS of IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. However, these LS were poorly organized, failed to display separated T and B cell zones resulting in loss of immune infiltrates and LS disruption at late stage of disease. On the contrary, early after <italic>Mtb</italic> infection WT-B6 LS exhibited well-defined B cell areas associated to FDC aggregates along with efficient recruitment of immune cells <xref rid="pone.0062751-Carragher1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and maintained a defined organization throughout TB. Importantly, the high expression of CCL19 in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LS at day 15 p.i. correlated with the accumulation of immune infiltrates but not with the organization of these structures. At the same time point, high levels of CXCL12 in WT-B6 LS correlate with the recruitment and spatial localization of the immune infiltrates. At late phase of infection, high expression of both CCL19 and CXCL12 was observed only in control mice and correlated with the maintenance and the lymphoid organization of immune infiltrates composed of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, DC and FDC. These findings suggest that homeostatic chemokines such as CCL19 and CXCL12 have non-overlapping roles in their ability to promote LS organogenesis, confirming previous reports <xref rid="pone.0062751-Slight1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Luther1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, at early stage of infection high levels of CCL19 in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may account for the pulmonary recruitment of immune infiltrates, possible through a chemokine/lymphotoxin loop <xref rid="pone.0062751-Foo1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In contrast, the spatial organization of well-defined T and B cell zones in LS depends on additional signals including high levels of CXCL12 that are induced in WT-B6 controls, but not in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>IRF-8 deficiency does not appear to limit the initial steps of granuloma formation, as evidenced by efficient recruitment of immune cells including macrophages, T lymphocytes and FDC in deficient mice at early stages. The occurrence of these events is in accordance with the high levels of CCL19 an may lead to the fast development of granulomatous structures, which are likely exploited by mycobacteria for their proliferation and dissemination within the host <xref rid="pone.0062751-Ramakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, at late stages of infection, when IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> granulomas become acute exhibiting features of caseous necrosis, the influx of selected immune cells declined, causing failure of granuloma contain mycobacterial dissemination.</p><p>One important finding reported in this study is the massive infiltration of neutrophils in both LS and granulomas of IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and their persistence at all stages of TB. Recently, IFN-inducible neutrophil activity in host response to <italic>Mtb</italic> has gained renewed interest <xref rid="pone.0062751-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Although early recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection should ensure protective immunity, inefficiency in their activity may lead to detrimental immune responses <xref rid="pone.0062751-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In this light, high numbers of neutrophils early after <italic>Mtb</italic> infection are thought to correlate with protection, whereas at late stages of TB they may be associated to poor prognosis. Herein, we report that, despite the high numbers of lung neutrophils in the early stages of infection, a protective immunity was not established in IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We envisage that although these cells may restrict mycobacterial replication as suggested by similar bacterial loads in both strains of mice up to day 15 p.i., they may dampen the development of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immunity. In this regard, activated neutrophils have been reported to exert an immunosuppressive function on T cells in humans <xref rid="pone.0062751-Munder1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. On the other hand, neutrophils can release cytokines, such as IL-12, and chemokines, such as CXCL10, that attract and activate T lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0062751-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, or may deliver activation signals to DC, thus promoting protective immunity <xref rid="pone.0062751-Behr1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Since IRF-8 deficiency is associated to impaired IL-12 production and DC maturation <xref rid="pone.0062751-Gabriele1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062751-Giese1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the neutrophils recruited in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lungs, may be unable to exert their function and to elicit protective adaptive immunity. The finding that also Treg cells were reduced throughout the course of infection in immunodeficient animals is consistent with the idea that, besides inflammation, IL-2-producing effector T cells drive the expansion of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific Treg that limit tissue inflammation and damage <xref rid="pone.0062751-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and suggest that IRF-8 controls several components crucial for the induction of adaptive immune response. Hence, at late stages of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection the clear-cut loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltrates and the disruption of LS and granuloma structures of IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lungs may represent key events hampering the initiation and amplification of a protective adaptive immunity.</p><p>Collectively, our results show that IRF-8 deficiency defines an acute mouse model of experimental TB. The pathological and immunological dissections of this model demonstrate that the proper formation of pulmonary newly-formed LS and granulomas is necessary to contain <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and limit TB disease. Moreover, our data disclose the prominent role of IRF-8 at late stages of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, when the massive recruitment of neutrophils and the loss of T cells in both LS and granulomas define the poor outcome of TB in deficient mice. Lastly, given the recent identification of an IRF-8-dependent genetic control for human mycobacterial disease <xref rid="pone.0062751-Hambleton1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, this work highlights the importance of the IRF-8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse model of acute TB as a valuable <italic>in vivo</italic> tool for comparative studies with chronically-infected congenic WT-B6 for dissecting those mechanisms underlying different immune reactions observed also in patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062751.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
