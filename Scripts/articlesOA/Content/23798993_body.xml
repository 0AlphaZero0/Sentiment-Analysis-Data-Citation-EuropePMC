These included three independent biological replicates, which were hybridized to duplicate slides and labeled in dye-swap.

Antisense RNA (aRNA) generated by this protocol was quantified and 2 &#x000b5;g were submitted to direct labeling of the second strand of cDNA. Labeling consisted of one round of reverse transcription by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) with the following modifications to the manufacturer's protocol: 2 &#x000b5;L random primer, 1 &#x000b5;L spike-in labeling control RNA (Stanford Genomics Facility), 2 &#x000b5;L Superscript III and a 2 hour incubation at 50&#x000b0;C.

This patients have a rare leprosy condition called pure neural leprosy (PNL) and although Ridley and Jopling postulated that PNL might occur across the spectrum from LL to TT forms, in our hands the vast majority of the PNL cases are paucibacillary. Second, a clear hyporesponsive immunopathogenetic profile was observed following live <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection. Indeed, active induction of an immune hyporesponsive state is detected <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is also associated with down-modulation of <italic>ex vivo</italic> immune responses (anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic) and decreased mitochondrial metabolism. In this context, although some genes were only different in one of the situations tested (<italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic>), results from both models reinforce the participation of specific genes and/or pathways in the pathogenesis of leprosy. <italic>CCL2</italic> and <italic>CCL3</italic>, for example, were repressed in both situations. However, other genes, such as <italic>IL8</italic> (in the THP-1 model) and <italic>CCL4</italic> (in the nerves biopsies) were down-regulated respectively, thus providing complementary information which points to the inhibition of chemokines by <italic>M. leprae</italic>, a possible survival strategy for the pathogen. One of the highlights of this work is that we used live <italic>M. leprae</italic>, which has been consistently shown to induce different pathways when compared to dead <italic>M. leprae</italic> in order to establish a niche for replication <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. These data also corroborate results from the multifamily genetic scan carried out in 2004, which identified the 17q21 region, enriched in chemokine genes such as <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, among others, as linked with leprosy. A decrease in chemokine expression could prevent activation of the host chemotactic response and, therefore, <italic>M. leprae</italic> could escape destruction by the immune system, contributing to the establishment of intracellular infection and consequently the spread of disease. It is important to note that these genes were selected for this study based on the genetic association study <xref rid="pone.0064748-Jamieson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> that had not been validated using approaches such as those employed here.</p><p>Likewise, it is remarkable that complementarity was observed between <italic>SOD2</italic> mRNA repression in THP-1 and several genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism that were down-regulated in the nerves. This result also indicates that this second pathway is crucial for <italic>M. leprae</italic> survival, although most of the genes were only significantly reduced in nerve biopsies. Once again, it is interesting to note that <italic>SOD2</italic> was also suggested to participate in leprosy susceptibility through a genomic scan <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mira1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The role of oxidative metabolism in leprosy had not been discussed previously.</p><p>Also, it is remarkable that &#x0201c;classic&#x0201d; immune response genes such as <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL12</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic> when tested appear to confirm our models as positive controls. Previously, it has been reported that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces down regulation of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0064748-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Sinsimer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines could be involved in the control of infection by <italic>M. leprae</italic> suggesting that mycobacteria may be attempting to avoid the host reaction in order to facilitate its survival. Curiously, our data also showed a borderline decrease (p&#x0003c;0.1) in expression of IL-6 mRNA in <italic>M. leprae</italic>-stimulated THP-1 cells. To this regard, another gene in the TNF superfamily, <italic>TNFSF15</italic>, was tested since an increased expression of this gene was observed in leprosy patient lesions <xref rid="pone.0064748-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and genetic variants in this gene were associated to leprosy susceptibility through a genome-wide association study <xref rid="pone.0064748-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This association, however, was not replicated in other studies <xref rid="pone.0064748-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Here, we found a borderline decrease (p&#x0003c;0.1) of this mRNA expression in the THP-1 model and our data was unable to clarify the role of TNFSF15 in leprosy.</p><p>An increase in LDL receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>) expression was observed in nerve biopsies of leprosy patients, which should lead to an increase in levels of LDL uptake. Indeed, lipid metabolism is crucial for <italic>M. leprae</italic> intracellular survival, and recently the accumulation of lipid derivatives in nerve lesions of LL patients was shown <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Also along these lines, cholesterol was described as being essential for the uptake of <italic>Mycobacterium kansaii</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG by macrophages <xref rid="pone.0064748-Peyron1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Indeed, the cholesterol content of the host's cell membrane seems to be essential for entry of mycobacteria. Therefore, the up-regulation of LDLR mRNA or protein in mycobacterial infections may increase levels of cellular cholesterol in order to facilitate entry into host cells. A classical hallmark of leprosy lesions is the presence of <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected macrophages/Schwann cells showing a foamy phenotype as a result of their high lipid content <xref rid="pone.0064748-Virchow1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Job1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In the present study we showed an increase in LDL receptor mRNA expression, the main receptor of native LDL, in nerve biopsies of leprosy patients as a potential mechanism of host lipid accumulation induced by <italic>M. leprae</italic>. This would imply in an increase in LDL uptake leading to cholesterol accumulation in the infected tissue. Indeed, in previous studies we were able to show that cholesterol and cholesterol ester accumulate both in leprosy lesions as well as in <italic>in vitro M. leprae</italic> infected cells as lipid droplets <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Moreover, we were able to show by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, both in the context of Schwann cells and macrophages, that <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection is able to increase host cell uptake of native LDL (unpublished data). Cholesterol metabolism has shown to play an important role in mycobacterial pathogenesis both by facilitating bacterial internalization <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> as well as by acting as a carbon and energy source <xref rid="pone.0064748-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, the up-regulation of LDLR mRNA in <italic>M. leprae</italic> infected nerves may increase levels of cellular cholesterol in order to facilitate entry and bacterial survival into host cells. In fact, it also raises an interesting possibility whereas detection of lipid metabolites could help diagnosis. A recent study performed on serum samples from patients before and after MDT conclusion (Amaral et al., unpublished data) confirmed previous observations by Al Mubarak and coworkers <xref rid="pone.0064748-AlMubarak1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> showing that polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism is deeply affected during leprosy.</p><p>Another gene that was down regulated in leprosy patient samples was <italic>Bad</italic>, which is a pro-apoptotic gene. <italic>Bad</italic> was also suppressed after infection of THP-1 by <italic>M. leprae</italic> in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0064748-Hasan1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> where authors observed that irradiated <italic>M. leprae</italic> inhibits apoptosis by diminishing pro-apoptotic Bad and Bak mRNA expression, while inducing the anti-apoptotic gene Mcl-1. These results could be combined with the induction of E3-ubiquitin ligases that also elicit an anti-apoptotic response. Indeed, <italic>PARK2</italic>, which is another E3-ubiquitin ligase, was previously shown to be associated with leprosy <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mira1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Also, it is quite interesting that two different E3-ubiquitin ligases were associated with leprosy using different approaches (genomic scan and microarray) suggesting that indeed ubiquitination is a crucial process, which possibly regulates apoptosis and is involved in leprosy susceptibility. Once more, we observe a coherent pattern of gene expression where <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces an anti-apoptotic response in the host cell, which would be an appropriate strategy for this intracellular pathogen that only multiplies every 14 days. It has been shown that Parkin is involved in the ubiquitination of Bcl-2, which prevents cytochrome c release from the mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0064748-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> preventing apoptosis. In fact, the regulation of mitochondrial functions, as observed in the results of this work, may also channel the cell in the same direction. We showed a decrease in mitochondrial gene expression in Schwann cells after infection with <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The very same genes were also down-regulated in nerve biopsies from leprosy patients suggesting a suppression of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Furthermore, SOD2, a mitochondrial gene involved in defense against superoxide (O2-) and other toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also down-regulated in THP-1 cells infected with <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The mitochondrial alterations observed are consistent with inhibition of apoptosis, which are often triggered in the mitochondria. These organelles play a central role as a stress sensor within the cell and the repression of mitochondrial genes could be a confirmation of the hypothesis of an anti-apoptotic effect caused by <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The mitochondrial alterations have already been associated with other disease models such as Chagas' disease, in which down-regulation of several transcripts encoding components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway was observed in a murine model infected by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064748-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, suggesting a decrease in global energy production and subsequent cardiac performance.</p><p>In this context, when we selected differentially expressed genes to cluster between leprosy and non-leprous patients, a distinctive pattern was found to distinguish between both groups. Significantly regulated genes clustered in three unique sets of genes, one of which was almost entirely composed of mitochondrial genes involved in the electron transport chain and found to be down-regulated in leprosy patients. Nonetheless, a classification tree was developed, based on the mRNA expression of only two genes, <italic>LDLR</italic> and <italic>CCL4</italic>, each of which belonged to a cluster with an opposite pattern of regulation in leprosy patients, either up or down, respectively. CCL4 was also observed recently as a potential biomarker to distinguish leprosy patients and controls of areas endemic, as Brazil <xref rid="pone.0064748-Geluk1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The discriminative power of these two genes was able to ascertain almost 80% of the cases as leprosy or non-leprous and this is extremely important in patients with difficult diagnosis, as the case of pure neural leprosy, which the pathology is restricted to the nerve and the patient did not presents skin lesions <xref rid="pone.0064748-Jardim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, this study is the first to show an induction of genes induced by type-I IFN by <italic>M. leprae</italic> in cells of the peripheral nervous system: IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM4. The type-I IFN-inducible genes had recently been observed to be more induced in skin lesions of leprosy patients with disseminated lepromatous form compared to patients with tuberculoid form <xref rid="pone.0064748-Teles1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. This result is consistent with other recent reports of global gene expression which identified this class of genes as induced in blood of patients with active tuberculosis compared to patients with latent tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0064748-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and identified a highly prominent type-I interferon molecular signature in three models of TB (newly-diagnosed TB patients followed-up through treatment, a BCG infected human macrophage cell line and an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse lung TB infection model) <xref rid="pone.0064748-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. An interferon-related signature in THP-1 cells infected by different <italic>M.tb</italic> strains was also identified <xref rid="pone.0064748-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In addition, another study in our laboratory found other members of this family, to be up-regulated in primary SCs infected by live <italic>M. leprae</italic> (unpublished data), consistent with the microarray analysis present here. The role of type I IFN in mycobacterial diseases still needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that decrease of various genes related to immune response and mitochondrial metabolisms against infection by <italic>M. leprae</italic> indicating that <italic>M. leprae</italic> appears to have a suppressive effect in human cells may be associated with negative regulation of the immune response and therefore for success of the infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0064748.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
