<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) causes tuberculosis (TB) and is responsible for about 2 million deaths annually <xref rid="pone.0067277-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One of the most intriguing aspects of Mtb infection is the spectrum of disease outcomes, ranging from several degrees of pathogenesis, latency or clearance <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kirschner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Various host factors, including malnutrition and co-infection with HIV, influence on the outcome of TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kirschner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recently, the contribution of Mtb genetic variation to the heterogeneity of TB outcomes is gaining importance <xref rid="pone.0067277-Coscolla1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although TB was thought to be caused by essentially identical bacteria, recent evidence showed that it consists of 6 major lineages, each associated with geographical human populations <xref rid="pone.0067277-Gagneux1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and with highly variable types of inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0067277-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Portevin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Much interest has been recently devoted to the study of the heterogeneity of responses associated with the East Asian (Bejing/W) (Bj) lineage of Mtb <xref rid="pone.0067277-Parwati1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Several studies associate Mtb Bj strains with more severe forms of TB, TB outbreaks, drug resistance and less efficacious BCG vaccination <xref rid="pone.0067277-Parwati1" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0067277-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0067277-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Experimental infections with Mtb Bj strains show the induction of non-uniform immune responses <xref rid="pone.0067277-Aguilar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Dormans1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but the molecular bases underlying this variability remain largely unclear.</p><p>The initiation of the immune response to Mtb relies on bacterial sensing by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), as TLRs, expressed by multiple cell types including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recognition of Mtb by TLRs triggers various intracellular signaling cascades, ultimately inducing the production of cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial molecules <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Evidence demonstrating a role for TLR activation in the control of Mtb comes from studies showing a lethal infection in mice lacking the master TLR signaling adaptor MyD88 <xref rid="pone.0067277-Fremond1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Scanga1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, the contribution of individual TLRs awaits further clarification. TLR2 is central for <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of the innate immune response <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and was shown to impact the maintenance of Th17 cells in the lung of Mtb-infected animals <xref rid="pone.0067277-TeixeiraCoelho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and granuloma formation <xref rid="pone.0067277-TeixeiraCoelho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, but not bacterial burden <xref rid="pone.0067277-TeixeiraCoelho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bafica1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Sugawara1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The role of other TLRs, such as TLR4 and TLR9, has been less addressed <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bafica1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kamath1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Reiling1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In humans, the association of TLR polymorphisms with susceptibility to TB remains to be confirmed/needs further studies <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Different polymorphisms in the human <italic>TLR2</italic> gene were reported to associate with increased susceptibility to TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ogus1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Thuong1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Velez1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Yim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, whereas such association was not observed in other studies <xref rid="pone.0067277-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Selvaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, a MAL/TIRAP functional variant, affecting signaling through TLR2, was shown to be protective in TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Khor1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Regarding TLR4, while genetic polymorphisms in an Asian Indian population were linked to an increased susceptibility and severity of pulmonary TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Najmi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, in Gambian, Indian or Chinese TB patients no association was found <xref rid="pone.0067277-Selvaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Newport1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This discrepancy might be explained on the basis of a dynamic host-pathogen genetic and pathogen phenotypic interplay, as postulated from studies involving <italic>TLR2</italic> polymorphisms <xref rid="pone.0067277-Caws1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Herein we show that some Mtb strains preferentially activate TLR2, whereas others activate TLR4. This differential recognition of Mtb strains impacts on both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> immune responses, specifically inducing the production of different arrays of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

In the search for the host molecular basis underlying this heterogeneity, we started by comparing the induction of cytokine production by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) upon stimulation with a collection of phylogenetically diverse Mtb isolates of the Bj lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Our analysis of cytokine production by infected cells was performed at 6 h post-infection, in order to focus on the events triggered by the innate immune recognition of Mtb strains, thus minimizing autocrine effects likely to occur at later times. Among this collection of Mtb isolates, we found strains, including HN878, that were lower inducers of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production than H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which is in line with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0067277-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, we also found strains that induced higher cytokine production in macrophages than H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall the highest cytokine amounts were detected in macrophages infected with Mtb strain 02-171. This strain induced significantly higher TNF production than Mtb H37Rv at all moi tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The differences observed in the TNF production between Mtb strains H37Rv and 02-171 were not related to specific stocks, as independent stocks prepared by independent operators yielded the same results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067277.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Furthermore, the differences in the cytokine responses induced in macrophages upon infection with different Mtb strains was not due to differential infection rate or bacterial uptake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067277.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0067277-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067277.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mtb strains induce heterogeneous cytokine profiles in macrophages.</title><p>(A) Phylogenetic distribution of the studied Mtb strains within the different subgroups of the Bj family defined by the presence or absence of the genomic deletions RD105, RD181, RD150, and RD142.

All bacterial stocks were handed in the same way, as detailed in Materials and Methods.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0067277.g001"/></fig><p>Interestingly, Mtb strain 02-171 was unique in its ability to induce the secretion of IFN-&#x003b2; by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To make sure that the differences observed were not due to delays in the kinetic profile of IFN-&#x003b2; production induced by Mtb strains H37Rv or 02-171, we measured IFN-&#x003b2; in the supernatants of 24 h infected macrophages and the same outcome was observed; however, at this time point, Mtb H37Rv induced a robust production of TNF, IL-10 and IL-1&#x003b2; by infected macrophages (data not shown). Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of IFN-&#x003b2; transcription upon infection of macrophages with Mtb strains, showed that strain 02-171 induced high levels of expression, whereas for the reference strain, H37Rv, only negligible transcriptional induction of this gene was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Considering the aforementioned unique secretion of IFN-&#x003b2; by macrophages infected with Mtb strain 02-171 and that TLRs are important in the recognition of Mtb <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we hypothesized that the observed heterogeneity might be due to differential activation of TLRs, particularly of TLR4, by Mtb isolates. To test this hypothesis, we infected BMDM of WT, TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> origin, with the panel of Mtb Bj strains under study. Interestingly, we found that the induction of cytokine production by macrophages was due, for most of the studied strains, to TLR2 activation, as expected from previous studies <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, whereas in the case of Mtb strain 02-171 it was mostly dependent on TLR4 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In particular, the ability of Mtb strain 02-171 to induce the secretion of IFN-&#x003b2; by infected BMDM was totally dependent of TLR4 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom panel). Kinetic mRNA analysis of WT BMDM infected with Mtb strains H37Rv or 02-171 revealed a pattern of variation consistent with the protein analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067277.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). The production of TNF by macrophages infected with Mtb strain 02-171 depended on the activation of TLR4 for all tested moi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067277.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). The presence of polymyxinB (an endotoxin inhibitor), at a concentration that inhibited over 50% of the TNF production by BMDM in response to LPS, did not interfere with the response of BMDM infected with Mtb strains H37Rv, HN878 or 02-171 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition to TLR2 and TLR4, TLR9 has also been involved in Mtb recognition <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bafica1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We tested whether Mtb strain 02-171 varied in its ability to induce TLR9 signals and found that the contribution of this receptor to TNF induction was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), in line with previous reports for Mtb strain H37Rv <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bafica1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Recognition by TLR4 was not unique to the Mtb Bj lineage as an isolate of the Euro-American lineage (Mtb strain Harlingen) also triggered cytokine production in macrophages via TLR4, including the production of IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0067277-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067277.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mtb strains specifically activate TLR2 or TLR4 for cytokine induction.</title><p>(A) BMDM generated from WT (black bars), TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (grey bars) or TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (white bars) mice were infected with various Mtb strains and cytokine secretion measured as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>.

In line with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the expression of cytokines at the site of infection was higher in the case of Mtb strain 02-171 as compared to H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the lung expression of iNOS during infection with Mtb strain 02-171 was also higher than with H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Altogether our data suggest that Mtb strain 02-171 may be more virulent for mice during the innate immune phase of the infection, although the adaptive immune response is efficient in inducing bacteriostasis. To further investigate whether Mtb strain 02-171 is indeed more virulent for mice than H37Rv during innate immunity, we infected Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with either strain and followed the progression of infection. Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with Mtb strain 02-171 succumbed earlier than H37Rv-infected ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) and showed higher bacterial burdens at day 30 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Our data thus show that Mtb strain 02-171 is more virulent than H37Rv as evidenced by a faster bacterial replication at early stages of infection, earlier killing of immune compromised hosts and enhanced lung pathology. However, Mtb strain 02-171 does induce an adaptive immune response that manages to reduce lung bacterial loads at later stages of infection.</p><fig id="pone-0067277-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067277.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Mtb Bj strain 02-171 is more virulent during the innate immune response than H37Rv.</title><p>(A) WT mice were intranasally infected with Mtb strains H37Rv (white bars) or 02-171 (black bars) and at the indicated time points post-infection, lung cell suspensions were prepared, diluted and plated into 7H11 agar to determine the number of mycobacterial CFUs in the lung.

Recognition of Mtb mediated by TLR4 was not associated with particular phylogeographical groups within the Bj lineage, as strains within the same group (eg. 04-092 and 02-171 strains from Gr3) preferentially activated different TLRs. However, such a scenario may be different if a more high-resolution tool for phylogenetic analysis <xref rid="pone.0067277-Mestre1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> is used. TLR4 triggering was also not exclusive of the Bj lineage, as an Euro-American Mtb strain (Harlingen) was predominantly recognized by this TLR. Finally, the heterogeneity of the immune response and the differential TLR recognition reported were also not related to the profile of drug susceptibility of each strain <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ghebremichael1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>TLR4 activation results in intracellular signals mediated by both MyD88 and TRIF, whereas TLR2 signals depend on MyD88 alone <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Our findings showing that Mtb strain 02-171 (a TLR4-activating and type I IFN inducer) was more virulent during the innate phase of the immune response than H37Rv in mice are in line with these observations. Nevertheless, in the absence of TLR4 we found a further increase on the lung bacterial burden of mice infected with Mtb strain 02-171, despite the lower induction of IFN-&#x003b2; expression. Also, Mtb strain Harlingen, another TLR4 activating strain, showed a degree of virulence comparable to H37Rv (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067277.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>), pointing to the fact that the mechanisms underlying differences in virulence during the innate phase of the immune response are most likely multifactorial. On one hand, differences in virulence may result from the balance of cytokine responses induced by different strains. Indeed, Mtb strain 02-171 induced higher levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the lung of infected animals, a balance that may favor susceptibility during the innate phase of the immune response. This balance was altered in the absence of TLR4, where we observed a decrease in the overall cytokine expression and in the expression and production of iNOS, accompanying an increase in bacterial burden. On the other hand, it is also possible that Mtb strain 02-171 shows a higher resistance to host innate killing mechanisms, thus escaping them and growing faster during the early phases of infection.</p><p>Our data suggest a possible dual role for TLR4 during infection with certain strains of Mtb, since its activation not only induced type I IFN, that may result in increased susceptibility <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manzanillo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Desvignes1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, but simultaneously induced the expression of protective cytokines (e.g. TNF) and of iNOS, a molecule known to be important for the control infection <xref rid="pone.0067277-North1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

In contrast, the adaptive immunity was equally effective either in the presence or absence of TLR4, causing a significant reduction in CFU numbers observed after day 18 of infection.

The bacterial burden 24 h post-infection was Log10(CFU) 2.67&#x000b1;0.57, Log10(CFU) 2.45&#x000b1;0.76 and Log10(CFU) 2.51&#x000b1;0.46 (Mean&#x000b1;SEM for 6 (H37Rv or 02-171) or 5 (Harlingen) animals) for Mtb strains H37Rv, 02-171 or Harlingen infected mice, respectively. The statistics analysis was determined by the Student&#x02019;s t-test (*,p&#x0003c;0.05; **p&#x0003c;0.01; ***,p&#x02264;0.001).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0067277.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec>
