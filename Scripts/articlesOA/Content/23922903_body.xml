Co-infection with HIV/AIDS and the emergence of drug resistant strains have made improved TB control an urgent necessity.

However, in T cells, NKG2D acts as a co-stimulatory receptor until a high activation status is reached, influenced by cytokine action, that enables it to act as an activation receptor and bypassing the conventional TCR-CD28 stimulation pathway <xref rid="pone.0070063-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has investigated NKG2D gene and protein expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells during active TB disease, latent infection and TB treatment. Contrary to our expectation, the <italic>ex vivo</italic> NKG2D mRNA expression and lymphocyte protein expression in blood was not significantly different in active TB disease compared to latently-infected or non-infected household contacts at diagnosis. There was, however, a dramatic reduction in NKG2D expression within the 2 month intensive treatment phase, and this was followed by a return to high levels by the end of treatment in successfully cured patients. There was no modulation of NKG2D expression in two patients who died during the continuation phase.</p><p>NKG2D is expressed by cytotoxic cells, where it is involved in cytolytic killing <xref rid="pone.0070063-Champsaur1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and it can mediate costimulation for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Markiewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, promoting a Tc1 phenotype <xref rid="pone.0070063-Maasho1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In this study, NKG2D mRNA was highly expressed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in healthy donors following stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> with mycobacteria. In contrast, DAP10 mRNA was expressed in both T cell subsets, indicating that expression of the two protein subunits of the receptor complex are regulated via different mechanisms, in accordance with a previous study <xref rid="pone.0070063-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The modulation of NKG2D expression in TB patients with successful treatment occurred in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and to a lesser extent on NK cells, as determined by flow cytometry. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are crucially involved in protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>: patients with active TB disease have fewer circulating terminally-differentiated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than latently-infected healthy subjects, with a reduction in the proportion of polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and lower perforin and IFN&#x003b3; production <xref rid="pone.0070063-Caccamo1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The biphasic nature of the changes in NKG2D expression with treatment might reflect a combination of altered sequestering of lymphocytes in the lungs, varying with changes in bacterial burden and antigen level, together with altered differentiation stages of circulating lymphocytes and altered general ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. Overnight stimulation of diluted blood <italic>in vitro</italic>, either with live mycobacteria (<italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG) or anti-CD3 mAb, enhanced NKG2D expression in untreated TB patients, compared to that in uninfected controls or after two months of treatment. This could imply that there were more differentiated effector cells in the blood capable of responding rapidly to antigenic stimulation. Alternatively, the reduced NKG2D expression at month 2 of treatment might reflect a loss of a cytotoxic lymphocyte population, possibly due to cellular exhaustion, which is later replenished, coinciding with cure and immune restoration. Although it is possible that the antibiotics themselves had a direct effect on NKG2D expression, we consider this unlikely as in previous transcriptomic studies, we and other investigators have seen no evidence of a direct effect on immune cell gene expression profiles <xref rid="pone.0070063-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Cliff2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, if the change in gene expression was due to a non-specific toxic effect, one would also expect it occur in the two patients who died, but this was not the case. Future studies will be aimed at testing the direct effects of anti-mycobacterial treatment on peripheral gene expression, to formally rule out this possibility.</p><p>NKG2D has previously been shown to be upregulated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy donors following stimulation with live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>

One study examining NKG2D expression on NK cells in TB patients found no difference to that in controls <xref rid="pone.0070063-Parasa1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, in agreement with the present study. The potential importance of NKG2D in controlling <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection has been demonstrated in mouse models, whereby CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is impaired in mice deficient for DAP10, the NKG2D signaling adapter molecule <xref rid="pone.0070063-Hessmann1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. IL-15-deficient mice are highly susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and this defect is mediated in part by reduced NKG2D expression <xref rid="pone.0070063-Rausch1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. NKG2D expression is also modulated by IL-2, which increases both NKG2D and DAP-10 expression on murine cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, whereas TGF-&#x003b2;, which is elevated in active human TB disease but declines with chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0070063-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Olobo1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, down-regulates NKG2D expression on human CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Eisele1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Friese1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Thus the altered cytokine milieu in active TB and its modulation with treatment will affect NKG2D expression.</p><p>NKG2D has multiple ligands, which are upregulated on stressed cells or infected cells in a complex manner <xref rid="pone.0070063-Kloss1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

Interestingly, cytomegalovirus co-infection can inhibit NKG2D ligand expression, leading to immune-suppression <xref rid="pone.0070063-Chalupny1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, binding of soluble ligands, shed from activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, can lead to down-regulation of NKG2D expression and immune-suppression <xref rid="pone.0070063-Cerboni1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and this mechanism may have been involved in the dramatic down-regulation of NKG2D observed in the intensive therapy phase of this study. Further studies in larger and diverse ethnic populations should be performed to validate these findings if NKG2D is to be useful as a biomarker for TB drug discovery. Changes in NKG2D in response to TB-treatment in HIV-positive people should also be determined. It would be particularly interesting to extend the functional characterization of CD8<sup>+</sup>NKG2D<sup>+</sup> T cells during TB treatment, to determine their cytokine production and differentiation state.</p><p>Host biomarkers of TB treatment-response would revolutionize clinical trials of new drugs, by allowing sensitive measurement of drug efficacy early after treatment initiation and without reliance on microbiological assays or a 2-year relapse rate <xref rid="pone.0070063-Walzl2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We have shown here that NKG2D expression is greatly reduced in peripheral blood during the intensive phase of successful TB treatment. Thus changes in peripheral NKG2D expression might be a useful contribution to a TB drug-efficacy biosignature in conjunction with other gene expression <xref rid="pone.0070063-Cliff2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, secreted immune mediators and clinical parameters of treatment response. To be useful in TB drug development, potentially as a surrogate endpoint for the 2-year relapse rate in clinical trials, a TB drug-efficacy biosignature would need to be tested and validated in surrogate marker clinical trials, possibly alongside drug candidate clinical trials to improve feasibility and reduce cost. Ultimately, a TB drug-efficacy surrogate marker biosignature would dramatically reduce the cost of TB drug and regimen clinical trials, allowing earlier decision making and potentially the licensing of more compounds.</p></sec>
