<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately nine million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB), and 1.4 million deaths from TB, are estimated to occur globally each year <xref rid="pone.0070630-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Prompt diagnosis is vital to avoid treatment delay, hence the ability to discriminate TB from other pulmonary conditions which can present similarly to TB, such as sarcoidosis, or have an acute (community acquired pneumonia) or chronic (primary lung cancer) presentation is important.</p><p>TB and sarcoidosis are widespread multisystem diseases that preferentially involve the lung and often present in a similar clinical, radiological and histological manner. Distinguishing these diseases therefore can require an invasive biopsy. Granuloma formation is fundamental to both conditions and although the pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is recognised as the aetiological cause of TB, what underlies sarcoidosis is unknown <xref rid="pone.0070630-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The pathways involved in granulomatous inflammation are also poorly understood and there is little understanding of disease-specific differences. TB and sarcoidosis can also display a similar presentation to acute pulmonary infectious diseases such as community acquired pneumonia and chronic lung disorders such as primary lung cancer.</p><p>Given the complexity of these diseases a systems biology approach may help unravel the principal host immune responses. Peripheral blood has the capacity to reflect pathological and immunological changes elsewhere in the body, and identification of disease associated alterations can be determined by a blood transcriptional signature <xref rid="pone.0070630-Pascual1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In support of this concept, we recently demonstrated an interferon (IFN)-inducible blood signature in patients with pulmonary TB from London and South Africa <xref rid="pone.0070630-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which has now been validated in three independent studies in Africa <xref rid="pone.0070630-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Indonesia <xref rid="pone.0070630-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Blood gene expression profiling has also been successfully applied to other infectious and inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), to help understand disease mechanisms and improve diagnosis and treatment <xref rid="pone.0070630-Pascual1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Two recent studies have used blood transcriptional profiling for the comparison of pulmonary TB and sarcoidosis; both studies found the diseases had similar transcriptional responses, which involved the overexpression of IFN-inducible genes <xref rid="pone.0070630-Koth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However these studies did not examine other similar pulmonary diseases raising the question of whether these transcriptional signatures also reflected other pulmonary disorders.</p><p>The main objective of our study was to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis underlying sarcoidosis and TB by comparing the blood transcriptional responses in pulmonary TB patients to that found in pulmonary sarcoidosis, pneumonia and lung cancer patients. We also compared the blood transcriptional responses before and after treatment in each disease, and examined the transcriptional responses seen in the different leucocyte populations of the granulomatous diseases. In addition we investigated the association in sarcoidosis between clinical activity and the observed blood transcriptional heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population and Inclusion Criteria</title><p>The majority of the TB patients were recruited from Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London. The sarcoidosis patients were recruited from Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St Mary&#x02019;s Hospital Imperial College NHS Trust, Barnet and Chase Farm NHS Trust in London, the Oxford Sarcoidosis Clinic, Churchill Hospital in Oxford, and the Avicenne Hospital in Paris. The pneumonia patients were recruited from Royal Free Hospital, London. The lung cancer patients and 5 of the TB patients in the Test Set were recruited by the Lyon Collaborative Network, France. All patients were recruited consecutively over time such that the Training Set was recruited first followed by the Test Set, Validation Set and lastly the patients&#x02019; samples that were used in the cell purification. Additional blood gene expression data were obtained from pulmonary and latent TB patients recruited and analysed in our earlier study which were then re-analysed in this study when comparing responses before and after TB treatment <xref rid="pone.0070630-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were specific for each disease. Pulmonary TB patients: culture confirmed <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in either sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage; pulmonary sarcoidosis: diagnosis made by a sarcoidosis specialist, granuloma&#x02019;s on biopsy, compatible clinical and radiological findings (within 6 months of recruitment) according to the WASOG guidelines <xref rid="pone.0070630-Costabel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; community acquired pneumonia patients: fulfilled the British Thoracic Society guidelines for diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0070630-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; lung cancer patients: diagnosis by a lung cancer specialist, histological and radiological features consistent with primary lung cancer; healthy controls: their gender, ethnicity and age were similar to the patients, negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) (Cellestis) test. The exclusion criteria for all patients and healthy controls included significant other medical history (including any immunosuppression such as HIV infection), aged below 18 years or pregnant.

RNA was isolated using 1.5ml whole blood and the MagMAX-96 Blood RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. 250 &#x000b5;g of isolated total RNA was globin reduced using the GLOBINclear 96-well format kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Total and globin-reduced RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA yield was assessed using a NanoDrop8000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Biotinylated, amplified antisense complementary RNA (cRNA) targets were then prepared from 200&#x02013;250ng of the globin-reduced RNA using the Illumina CustomPrep RNA amplification kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion). 750 ng of labelled cRNA was hybridized overnight to Illumina Human HT-12 V4 BeadChip arrays (Illumina), which contained more than 47,000 probes. The arrays were washed, blocked, stained and scanned on an Illumina iScan, as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from the granulocytes/erythrocytes using a Lymphoprep&#x02122; (Axis-Shield) density gradient. Monocytes (CD14+), CD4+ T cells (CD4+) and CD8+ T cells (CD8+) were isolated sequentially from the PBMCs using magnetic antibody-coupled (MACS) whole blood beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

After background subtraction each probe was attributed a flag to denote its signal intensity detection <italic>p</italic>-value. Flags were used to filter out probe sets that did not result in a &#x02018;present&#x02019; call in at least 10% of the samples, where the &#x02018;present&#x02019; lower cut off&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.99. Signal values were then set to a threshold level of 10, log2 transformed, and per-chip normalised using 75<sup>th</sup> percentile shift algorithm. Next per-gene normalisation was applied by dividing each messenger RNA transcript by the median intensity of all the samples. All statistical analysis was performed after this stage. Raw microarray data has been deposited with GEO (Accession number GSE42834). All data collected and analysed in the experiments adhere to the Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>GeneSpring 11.5 was used to select transcripts that displayed expression variability from the median of all transcripts (unsupervised analysis). A filter was set to include only transcripts that had at least twofold changes from the median and present in &#x02265;10% of the samples. Unsupervised analysis was used to derive the 3422-transcripts. Applying a non-parametric statistical filter (Kruskal Wallis test with a FDR (Benjamini Hochberg)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01), after the unsupervised analysis, generated the 1446-transcript and 1396-transcript signatures. The two signatures differed only in which groups the statistical filter was applied across; 1446, five groups (TB, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, lung cancer and controls) and 1396, six groups (TB, active sarcoidosis, non-active sarcoidosis, pneumonia, lung cancer and controls).</p><p>Differentially expressed genes for each disease were derived by comparing each disease to a set of controls matched for ethnicity and gender within a 10% difference. GeneSpring 11.5 was used to select transcripts that were &#x02265;1.5 fold different in expression from the mean of the controls and statistically significant (Mann Whitney unpaired FDR (Benjamini Hochberg)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01). Comparison Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood, CA) was used to determine the most significant canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes of each disease relative to the other diseases (Fisher&#x02019;s exact FDR(Benjamini Hochberg)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05). The bottom x-axis and bars of each comparison IPA graph indicated the log(p-value) and the top x-axis and line indicated the percentage of genes present in the pathway.</p><p>Molecular distance to health (MDTH) was determined as previously described <xref rid="pone.0070630-Pankla1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and then applied to different transcriptional signatures. Transcriptional modular analysis was applied as previously described <xref rid="pone.0070630-Guiducci1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The raw expression levels of all transcripts significantly detected from background hybridisation were compared between each sample and all the controls present in that dataset. The percentage of significantly expressed genes in each module were represented by the colour intensity (Student t-test, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), red indicates overexpression and blue indicates underexpression. The mean percentage of significant genes and the mean fold change of these genes compared to the controls in specified modules were also shown in graphical form. MDTH and modular analysis were calculated in Microsoft Excel 2010. GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows was used to generate the graphs.</p><p>Differentially expressed genes between the Training Set TB patients and active sarcoidosis patients were derived using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (<italic>q</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and &#x02265;1.5 fold expression change <xref rid="pone.0070630-Tusher1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. SAM was used due to the increased sensitivity of this non-parametric test compared to Mann-Whitney allowing more differentially expressed transcripts to be identified between TB and active sarcoidosis. Class prediction was performed within GeneSpring 11.5 using the machine learned algorithm support vector machines (SVM). The model was built using sample classifiers &#x02018;TB&#x02019; or &#x02018;not TB&#x02019;. The SVM model should be built in one study cohort and run in an independent cohort to prevent over-fitting the predictive signature. This was possible for all the cohorts from our study. Where the study cohorts used a different microarray platform the SVM model had to be re-built in that cohort. To reduce the effects of over-fitting the same SVM parameters were always used. The kernel type used was linear, maximum iterations 100,000, cost 100, ratio 1 and validation type N-fold where N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3 with 10 repeats. The receiver operating curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2010.</p><p>Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were calculated using STATA 9 (StataCorp 2005. Stata Statistical Software: Release 9. College Station, TX; StataCorp LP). In the multivariate regression analysis where there were missing data points (serum ACE and HRCT disease activity) to prevent list-wise deletion dummy variable adjustment was used.</p><p>The power calculations were conducted using the Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (PASS) 2008.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Blood Transcriptional Profiles are Similar in the Pulmonary Granulomatous Diseases, TB and Sarcoidosis but Distinct from Pneumonia and Lung Cancer</title><p>Cohorts of TB and sarcoidosis, community acquired pneumonia and lung cancer patients, and healthy controls are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070630-t001">Table 1</xref> and Figures S1&#x02013;S3, and appropriately matched demographically and clinically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070630.s012">Tables S1</xref>-2).

The statistical significance (bottom x-axis, bar graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070630-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and percentage of genes (top x-axis, line graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070630-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) of the three immune response pathways were driven predominantly by the TB and active sarcoidosis patients, again demonstrating the similarity of the biological pathways underlying these diseases. However the IFN-signalling pathway was more significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070630-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and contained a higher number of genes in TB than active sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070630-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0070630-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0070630.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Comparison analysis of the diseases compared to matched controls reveals the four most significant pathways.</title><p>Differentially expressed genes were derived from the Training Set by comparing each disease to healthy controls matched for ethnicity and gender: TB&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2524, active sarcoidosis&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1391, pneumonia&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2801 and lung cancer&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1626 transcripts (&#x02265;1.5 fold change from the mean of the controls, Mann Whitney with Benjamini Hochberg FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01).

The TB unique genes comprised immune responses genes significantly associated with the IFN-signalling pathway and antigen presentation. The unique pneumonia genes were associated with an under-abundance of pathways related to protein synthesis. The unique lung cancer genes were associated with over-abundance of inflammation related pathways and under-abundance of T cell pathways. Overlapping genes common to all four disease groups were significantly associated with under-abundance of T and B cell pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>TB and Pneumonia Patients after Treatment Showed a Diminishment of Transcriptional Profiles Whereas Sarcoidosis Patients Responding to Glucocorticoids Showed a Significant Increase in Transcriptional Activity</title><p>We next examined the transcriptional response to treatment.

Sarcoidosis transcriptional profiles revealed heterogeneity correlating with clinical disease activity. The IFN-inducible transcripts appeared to be dominant in the neutrophils in sarcoidosis as well as TB. Treated-TB and pneumonia patients showed significant diminishment of their transcriptional activity, however, the treatment-responsive sarcoidosis patients revealed a significantly more active transcriptional profile dominated by inflammatory transcripts.</p><p>We previously reported an IFN-inducible blood transcriptional signature in patients with pulmonary TB, which correlated with extent of radiographic disease, diminished upon treatment <xref rid="pone.0070630-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and now confirmed in other studies <xref rid="pone.0070630-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Similar blood transcriptional profiles dominated by IFN-signalling in TB and sarcoidosis patients, using publicly available data (7) and smaller patient cohorts <xref rid="pone.0070630-Koth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, have since been reported. We now demonstrate an IFN-inducible blood transcriptional signature in TB and sarcoidosis patients using larger cohorts of independently recruited participants and new findings of a distinct signature from pneumonia and lung cancer. The heterogeneity of sarcoidosis blood transcriptional profiles was explained by a significant correlation with the clinical activity phenotype, not reported previously <xref rid="pone.0070630-Koth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but in accordance with the known clinical heterogeneity of sarcoidosis patients <xref rid="pone.0070630-Costabel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Baughman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Collectively these findings suggest the potential for blood transcriptomic approaches to provide information before prolonged follow-up of a patient and allow development of much needed tools to standardise and aid sarcoidosis management.</p><p>In contrast to the IFN-signalling pathways in TB and sarcoidosis, the transcriptomes in pneumonia and lung cancer represented inflammation related pathways, in keeping with different immunopathogenesis of these diseases, and pneumonia as an infection of the respiratory tract resulting in acute inflammation of the lungs and peripheral blood <xref rid="pone.0070630-FernandezSerrano1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Windgassen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The inflammatory blood transcriptional signature of lung cancer patients is in keeping with a role for inflammation in primary lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0070630-OCallaghan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, suggesting blood could be used for further exploratory studies where tissue is not available. The under-abundance of transcripts relating to T and B cells in all four diseases is consistent with previous observations of reduced numbers of immune cells in the blood of patients with TB, sarcoidosis and bacterial infection, likely due to migration or death <xref rid="pone.0070630-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Sweiss1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Ardura1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Although TB and sarcoidosis exhibited similar IFN-inducible transcriptional signatures, the significant quantitative difference in their transcriptional activity in whole blood and the neutrophils likely reflects the observed clinical differences. Sarcoidosis patients with a dominant IFN-inducible signature clustered with the TB patients whereas those with a much weaker IFN-inducible profile clustered with the healthy controls. Although IFN&#x003b3; has been shown to be crucial in controlling mycobacterial infection <xref rid="pone.0070630-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, type 1 IFN, induced by extracellular mycobacterial DNA activation of cytosolic receptors <xref rid="pone.0070630-Manzanillo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, or peptidoglycan activation of the NOD2/IRF5 pathway by <xref rid="pone.0070630-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, may exacerbate TB <xref rid="pone.0070630-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>

The immune pathways contributing to sarcoidosis remain unresolved although suggested to be associated with macrophage and Th1 activation <xref rid="pone.0070630-Gerke1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is notable that IFN&#x003b1; therapy for hepatitis C is a documented risk factor for developing sarcoidosis (approximately 5% of cases) <xref rid="pone.0070630-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; and IFN&#x000df; therapy has also been associated with case reports of sarcoidosis <xref rid="pone.0070630-Chakravarty1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. That sarcoidosis and TB patients show a similar transcriptional signature suggests that the underlying immunological processes of these two granulomatous diseases have much in common <xref rid="pone.0070630-Gerke1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A frequently suggested aetiological agent for sarcoidosis is mycobacteria, however the evidence for this is debated <xref rid="pone.0070630-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Establishing whether this IFN-inducible signature is reflective of granulomatous inflammation, or a response to pathogens such as mycobacteria, requires studies of additional pulmonary granulomatous diseases.</p><p>Successful treatment of TB and pneumonia patients with anti-microbial drugs led to diminishment of the blood transcriptional signature. However, sarcoidosis patients responding successfully to treatment showed a significant increase in transcriptional activity by MDTH of inflammatory transcripts, including the anti-inflammatory genes, IL1R2, IL18RAP, DUSP1, FOS, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and MAPK1, which invariably accompany the activation of inflammatory pathways <xref rid="pone.0070630-McColl1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Shipp1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Veenbergen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This is consistent with the mixed transcriptional response found after glucocorticoid stimulation of blood from healthy donors <xref rid="pone.0070630-Galon1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, the IFN-inducible signature was unchanged. In SLE it has been shown that while glucocorticoids suppress the inflammatory NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in many cells, they exerted no effect on secretion of IFN&#x003b1; by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, providing a potential reason for the reduced glucocorticoid sensitivity seen in SLE <xref rid="pone.0070630-Guiducci1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The underlying mechanisms resulting in the partial or negligible clinical responses towards glucocorticoids seen in many sarcoidosis patients are as yet undetermined <xref rid="pone.0070630-Paramothayan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>We identified 144 differentially expressed transcripts between TB and active sarcoidosis, including IFN-inducible transcripts that were over-abundant only in the TB patients and distinguished the TB samples from all other diseases in our three cohorts and an external cohort (Maertzdorf <italic>et al</italic> cohort) <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, (sensitivity &#x0003e;80%; specificity &#x0003e;90%). The two previously published studies comparing whole blood expression profiles of TB and sarcoidosis patients also derived transcript lists to differentiate the diseases <xref rid="pone.0070630-Koth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070630-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, however their lists produced much lower sensitivity, but similar specificity values when tested against our cohorts. The high specificity achieved by all transcript lists was due to the very low Type I error rate attributable to the low prevalence of true TB samples. Thus blood transcriptional signatures may have promise as supportive surrogate markers for pulmonary TB diagnosis, after satisfying rigorous testing and validation in large populations.</p><p>We have shown that the blood transcriptome of sarcoidosis like TB is dominated by an IFN-inducible neutrophil-driven signature, and heterogeneity of this signature is reflective of disease activity in sarcoidosis. In contrast, pneumonia and lung cancer were dominated by an inflammatory signature. Identification of biological pathways by transcriptomics enhances our understanding of the potential factors underlying pathogens is in the pulmonary granulomatous diseases TB and sarcoidosis and the acute and chronic pulmonary diseases, pneumonias and lung cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0070630.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
