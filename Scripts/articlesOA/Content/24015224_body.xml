<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutrophils represent the highest proportion of circulating leukocytes in the peripheral blood. Following invasion of microorganisms, these cells are recruited to the site of infection where they use their antimicrobial capacity to clear invading pathogens <xref rid="pone.0072249-Borregaard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In the last decade, this &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; view of neutrophils in the immune response has changed substantially. Besides their capacity to kill invading pathogens, neutrophils have been shown to modulate the immune system on various levels <xref rid="pone.0072249-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The first evidence that neutrophils can modulate the response of other immune cells was found in their interaction with dendritic cells (DCs). Neutrophils were shown to induce maturation of monocyte-derived DCs and boost DC cytokine production, resulting in T-cell proliferation and polarization towards a Th1 phenotype <xref rid="pone.0072249-vanGisbergen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072249-Megiovanni1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that during experimental human endotoxemia i.e. systemic inflammation elicited by LPS administration in healthy volunteers or severe trauma changes the heterogeneity of the circulating neutrophils pool dramatically <xref rid="pone.0072249-Pillay1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072249-Pillay2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Three different neutrophil subsets can be distinguished based on their expression of CD16 and CD62L. CD16<sup>dim</sup>/CD62L<sup>bright</sup> neutrophils appear to be released from the bone marrow and are characterized by a banded nuclear morphology and immature antimicrobial capacity. CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils display a hypersegmented nucleus, increased functional antimicrobial capacity and, strikingly, exhibit the capacity to suppress lymphocyte proliferation. This novel immune regulatory mechanism for neutrophils was shown to be dependent on hydrogen peroxide release and expression of integrin MAC-1 (&#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>) <xref rid="pone.0072249-Pillay2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To date, it is unclear how this CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> subset of neutrophils acquires the ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation. Knowledge on the regulation of this process could have important implications in the modulation of lymphocyte-mediated disease pathology.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that the total pool of circulating neutrophils during experimental human endotoxemia has a specific transcriptome profile that was reminiscent to a profile induced by a combination of direct activation by inflammatory cytokines and the influx of young neutrophils from the bone marrow <xref rid="pone.0072249-deKleijn1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the current study, we further investigated the transcriptome of the different neutrophil subsets that emerge in the circulation during experimental human endotoxemia, based on the expression of CD16 and CD62L in order to identify factors involved in generation of suppressive neutrophils. Additionally, we explored the mechanisms behind IFN-&#x003b3;-induced neutrophil-mediated lymphocyte suppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects and experimental human endotoxemia model</title><p>The neutrophil subset transcriptome was studied in 4 healthy male volunteers who participated in a human endotoxemia trial (Clinical Trial Register number NCT01374711, placebo group). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Radboud University Medical Centre and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki including current revisions and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</p><p>The experiments were performed according to a strict clinical protocol as described previously <xref rid="pone.0072249-Leentjens1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Subjects were screened before the start of the experiment and had a normal physical examination, electrocardiography, and routine laboratory values (including serology on HIV and hepatitis B). Subjects with febrile illness during the two weeks before the experiment were excluded. Subjects were not allowed to take any prescription drugs and asked to refrain from caffeine and alcohol intake 24 hours before the start of the experiment. Furthermore, subjects refrained from food 12 hours before the start of each endotoxemia experiment. After admission to the research intensive care unit of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, purified LPS (US Standard Reference Endotoxin <italic>Escherichia Coli O:113)</italic> obtained from the Pharmaceutical Development Section of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) was administered at a dose of 2 ng/kg body weight. In all subjects, heart rate (5-lead electrocardiogram) and blood pressure (20-gauge radial artery catheter) were monitored starting 2 hours before administration of LPS until discharge 8 hours after LPS administration. A cannula was placed in an antecubital vein to permit infusion of prehydration fluid (1.5 L 2.5% glucose/0.45% saline 1 hour before LPS administration), endotoxin, and continuous infusion of 2.5% glucose/0.45% saline (150 mL/hour during 8 hours after LPS administration) to ensure optimal hydration status. Body temperature was measured using an infrared tympanic thermometer (FirstTemp Genius, Sherwood Medical, Crawley/Sussex, UK). The course of endotoxin-induced flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, shivering, and muscle and back pain) was scored every 30 minutes on a 6-point Likert scale (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no symptoms, 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;very severe symptoms), resulting in a total score of 0 to 25.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>FACS analysis</title><p>During human endotoxemia experiments, sodium heparin anticoagulated blood was drawn from the arterial line.

We hypothesized that, next to the formation of a synapse by integrin MAC-1 on neutrophils, expression of PD-L1 would contribute to the suppressive function on lymphocyte proliferation because expression of this molecule on other cell types enables suppression of lymphocyte activation and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0072249-Keir1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Blocking MAC-1 using monoclonal antibody 44a in our co-cultures showed a modest decrease in suppressive capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072249-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As hypothesized, PD-L1 showed to be absolutely essential for the IFN-&#x003b3;-induced suppressive effect, because blocking PD-L1 attenuated suppression to the level of unstimulated neutrophils, whereas the isotype control antibody showed no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072249-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In order to evaluate the role of MAC-1 and IFN-&#x003b3; on the interaction between neutrophils and lymphocytes, we loaded neutrophils with Calcein-Blue and PBMCs with Calcein-AM. Interactions between these cell types were visualized as double positive events by flow cytometry. The percentage double positive events increased to more than 20% in 120 minutes of co-culture, which decreased to 15% in the presence of &#x003b1;CD11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072249-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, no differences were found between IFN-&#x003b3;-, GM-CSF-stimulated or unstimulated neutrophils. Therefore, we conclude that interactions between neutrophils and lymphocytes occur independently of stimulation, but only in the presence of PD-L1 expression neutrophils inhibit lymphocyte proliferation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we show that the neutrophil subsets that appear in the circulation during systemic inflammation elicited by experimental human endotoxemia, have distinct gene expression profiles. Our gene expression data indicate that for a significant amount of genes, the expression increases on a gradual scale with lowest expression in CD16<sup>dim</sup>/CD62L<sup>bright</sup> neutrophils, intermediate expression in CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>bright</sup> neutrophils and the highest expression in CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils. With regard to their pronounced inflammatory gene expression pattern and hypersegmented nucleus, it can be suggested that CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils are representative of a later phase in the lifespan of neutrophils. The origin of these CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils is currently unknown. Since CD62L is shed from activated neutrophils, this marker has limitations in defining a homogenous subset of neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0072249-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophil subset, obtained during experimental human endotoxemia, is clearly able to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in contrast to the CD16<sup>dim</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0072249-Pillay2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>We sought to investigate the factors involved in the generation of CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> suppressive neutrophil subset during systemic inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> based on their transcriptome. Our gene expression data showed upregulation of various IFN-induced genes during endotoxemia, which was most pronounced in the CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophil subset. Previously, it has been shown that stimulation of whole blood with IFN-&#x003b3; + GM-CSF induces expression of IFN-regulated genes <italic>CXCL10</italic>, <italic>IDO1</italic>, <italic>IL1A</italic>, <italic>CCRL2</italic> and <italic>CD274</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0072249-Kotz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, a profile that resembles the transcriptome of CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils.</p><p>The moment of increased surface expression of PD-L1 on neutrophils during experimental human endotoxemia (6 hours post LPS), compared to our <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments (6&#x02013;8 hours post IFN-&#x003b3;), which suggests that neutrophils are exposed to IFN-&#x003b3; shortly after LPS infusion. The main producers of IFN-&#x003b3; are CD4+ Th1 lymphocytes, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells <xref rid="pone.0072249-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These cell types typically do not respond directly to LPS, therefore, an indirect effect of LPS on the release of IFN-&#x003b3; appears more likely. For instance, it was recently shown that flagellin-induced rapid IL-18 release from dendritic cells, which induced IFN-&#x003b3; release from memory CD8+ T cells within 2 hours <xref rid="pone.0072249-Kupz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, whether a similar indirect mechanism is responsible for IFN-&#x003b3; release after LPS administration remains to be determined. Currently, we have no evidence that IFN-&#x003b3; induces PD-L1 expression on neutrophils <italic>in vivo</italic>, or whether PD-L1 on CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> neutrophils is essential for the suppressive capacity observed by Pillay and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0072249-Pillay2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The data we present here do support an important role for PD-L1 on neutrophils in lymphocyte proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The induction of PD-L1 on IFN-&#x003b3;-stimulated neutrophils is likely de novo synthesis since a recent study did not detect this protein in the granules <xref rid="pone.0072249-Rorvig1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Expression of PD-L1 on circulating neutrophils has been shown in patients with active tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0072249-McNab1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This is especially interesting because neutrophils from patients with active tuberculosis also exhibit an IFN-induced transcriptome profile, including increased expression of <italic>CXCL10</italic> and <italic>CD274</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0072249-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. To date, no studies have investigated PD-L1 expression on neutrophils during systemic inflammatory diseases. Interestingly, during sepsis, increased expression of PD-L1 on monocytes has been suggested to play an important role in sepsis-induced immunosuppression <xref rid="pone.0072249-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072249-Hotchkiss1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, we are the first to identify an immune-suppressive effect of IFN-&#x003b3; through expression of PD-L1 on neutrophils. Although originally defined as an agent with direct antiviral activity, the properties of IFN-&#x003b3; also include regulation of several neutrophil functions such as stimulation of the respiratory burst <xref rid="pone.0072249-Cassatella1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, increased <italic>ex vivo</italic> survival <xref rid="pone.0072249-Yoshimura1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and antigen presentation <xref rid="pone.0072249-Bankey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We demonstrate that the IFN-&#x003b3;-induced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation is dependent on increased expression of PD-L1. Under steady state conditions, expression of PD-L1 on neutrophils is very low <xref rid="pone.0072249-Bankey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and these neutrophils show only a minor suppressive phenotype <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The suppressive phenotype on lymphocyte proliferation was independent of the stimulation method, as similar findings were observed for PHA, CD3/CD28 and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> stimulation. The suppressive capacity of the IFN-&#x003b3;-stimulated neutrophils, as shown by neutrophil lymphocyte co-culture in transwell experiments, occurred in a cell-cell contact dependent manner. IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to increase expression of PD-L1 on various cell types <xref rid="pone.0072249-Sheng1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> resulting in suppressive activity through ligation with PD-1 on target cells <xref rid="pone.0072249-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. By blocking PD-L1 on neutrophils we verified that suppression of lymphocyte proliferation was dependent on PD-L1 &#x02013; PD1 signaling.</p><p>This study shows for the first time that suppressive neutrophils can be generated using IFN-&#x003b3;, which could be used as a novel approach to modulate inflammation. For instance, during influenza infections, the tissue damage that is associated with disease pathology is dependent on the presence of T-cells <xref rid="pone.0072249-Rygiel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this case, more damage is caused by the host&#x02019;s inflammatory response compared with damage caused by the virus itself. In order to maintain balance in inflammatory responses and to prevent excessive tissue damage, other immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, but as suggested by our data also neutrophils, dampen excessive T-cell responses. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that neutrophil depletion in influenza-infected mice leads to aggravated disease characterized by rapid weight loss, pneumoniae and death <xref rid="pone.0072249-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072249-Fujisawa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, stimulation of peripheral blood neutrophils with IFN-&#x003b3; <italic>ex vivo</italic> induces PD-L1 expression on neutrophils, which is shown to be essential in the suppression of lymphocyte proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>.
