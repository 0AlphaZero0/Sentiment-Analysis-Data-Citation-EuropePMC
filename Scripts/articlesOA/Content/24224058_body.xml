<sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> Tuberculosis is the primary cause of death from a bacterial disease, and is further exacerbated by the very extensive incidence of latent disease, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant forms of the bacillus [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Animal models have provided much information regarding the pathogenesis and host response to the disease process [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but a limitation of the most widely used model, the mouse, is the lack of lung necrosis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the hallmark of human tuberculosis. Necrosis is the central and eventually fatal event in the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and provides a safe niche in which bacilli surviving the initial wave of acquired immunity can persist [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. If, as in humans and in some cases guinea pigs [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the lesion cavitates, further transmission of the disease can ensue.</p><p> That is not to say however that some more recently described inbred mouse models do not develop necrosis. Chronically infected mice on the C3Heb/FeJ background, for instance, gradually develop degenerating lesions. Mice in which genes have been deleted for gamma interferon, B and T cells [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], GM-CSF [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and NOS2 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] all develop severe lung necrosis after low dose aerosol infection. More recently, it has been shown that C3HeB/FeJ and I/St murine strains undergo pulmonary lung necrosis during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p><p> There is increasing evidence that Gr1+ neutrophils are present in the granuloma and play a key role in the process of necrosis[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They are among the first cells to enter lesions [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], where they degranulate to form microfoci of eosinophilic debris which we suspect coalesce to form the central necrosis in the characteristic granuloma structure. They also produce reactive oxygen radicals which have little effect on the bacilli but can damage the integrity of the local vasculature and surrounding tissue [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Their influx drops as acquired immunity expands [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but if this wanes again, as can be observed in the guinea pig during chronic infection [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], they arrive anew. In human tuberculosis, they are the predominant population found in the airways and contribute to airway transmission [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, markers associated with neutrophils predominate in a transcriptional analysis of blood from tuberculosis patients [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, we have yet to fully understand neutrophils role in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> disease. </p><p> In the studies reported here, we used flow cytometry and cell sorting techniques to monitor the influx of granulocytes into the lungs of necrosis prone mouse strains NOS2-/-, RAG-/-, C3HeB/FeJ strains and wildtype C57BL/6 mice devoid of necrosis. We tracked the influx of Gr1+ cells to the lungs and demonstrate two distinct populations: one Gr-1<sup>hi</sup>, and a second, quite substantial Gr-1<sup>int</sup> population. Gr-1<sup>int</sup> cells have been described primarily in cancer, and are thought to be a more immature cell type, but there is evidence they can modulate both innate and acquired responses [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].These cells are a heterogeneous group of myeloid cells that are capable of regulation of inflammation in pathological conditions [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Ample evidence exists that MDSC have a reciprocal relationship with CD4+ T cells being able to induce activation and proliferation or suppression [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Our studies demonstrate Gr<sup>high</sup> and Gr1<sup>int</sup> cells from necrosis-prone mice have properties of MDSCs [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such as expression of Ly6c, CD14, F4/80, arginase I and IL-17. Furthermore, MDSCs from infected mice are capable of inducing activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cell cells and well as inhibiting proliferation showing a yet unidentified role for these cells in tuberculosis. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Evidence for an increase in CD11b+ but not CD11c+ cells in infected NOS2-/- mice</title><p>Flow cytometric analysis was performed on gene disrupted and wild-type (WT) mice in order to analyze the influx of leukocytes into the lungs.

In addition, we demonstrated this in NOS2 -/- mice and C3HeB/FeJ mice, but also in Rag2 -/- mice, the latter indicating that this response was independent of the need to generate acquired immunity. Furthermore, the presence of both populations of Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells was associated with the expression of high levels of arginase-1, a key enzyme modulating the immune response by depleting arginine. </p><p>We strongly suspect that neutrophils are the main cause of necrosis in both the mouse and guinea pig models of tuberculosis [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and this is further emphasized by studies in humans [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To date we were assuming that our observations in NOS2 -/- and other murine models were due to the influx of neutrophils, based on simply measuring &#x0201c;Gr1-positive&#x0201d; cells, but clearly our current concept needs to be significantly modified based on the observations here that Gr1<sup>hi</sup> and Gr1<sup>int</sup> cells represent two distinct granulocyte subsets.</p><p>Whereas some of the Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells are clearly neutrophils, an additional population of Gr1+ subsets, fall into the category of myeloid derived suppressor cells. These recognized as either a monocytic or granulocyte-like population that are implicated in the failure to control the growth of tumors [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and also play a vital role in the control of chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity. In the case of infectious diseases and specifically <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, very little is known about these Gr1<sup>int</sup> and Gr1<sup>high</sup> cells and their role remains unknown. Certain disease states, such as those caused by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] seem to strongly induce MDSC, as does viral infection with HIV and SIV [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the context of BCG vaccination, it was reported that MDSCs could be affecting vaccine efficacy through a nitric oxide dependent mechanism [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and were unable to kill BCG or <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. In addition, these studies showed they impaired T cell priming in the lymph node. Our results demonstrated that as the ratio of Gr1<sup>high</sup> cells to splenocytes increased reduced proliferation was present. Furthermore in other chronic infections such as <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and lupus prone MRL-Fas mice MDSC mediated suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, in agreement with our observation in Wild-type C57BL/6 and C3H/HeOuJ, Gr1<sup>int</sup> cells represented a minority of the total CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells. In contrast, Gr1<sup>int</sup> cells were increased only in tuberculosis murine models undergoing necrosis. </p><p> MDSCs appear to be able to modulate T cell functions [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and may possibly trigger regulatory T cells [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], an increasingly important subset in tuberculosis [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and this could be interpreted as a mechanism to limit inflammation in the lungs and hence reduce lung damage. This is far from clear however, and while a report [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] shows protection against sepsis by adoptive transfer of these cells, another shows that transfer into normal mice damages the lungs [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Mechanistically, the immunomodulatory activity present in MDSCs has been principally attributed to the expression of arginase and nitric oxide synthase [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Arginine depletion leads to decreased T cell expression of CD3&#x003b6; in tuberculosis and cancer patients [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>-<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and can cause T cell growth arrest [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the current tuberculosis murine models, arginase activity correlated with the development of lung necrosis and the presence of Gr1<sup>int</sup> cells. In fact, arginase-1 was co-localized to the rim of necrotic granulomas where Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells were also detected. In our studies in necrosis prone mice we identified large, vacuolated cells with a monocytic morphology, expressing arginase-1 and IL-17 cells identified by flow cytometry. However, further studies are required to determine the nature of the arginase-1 expressing cells. The presence of arginase-expressing cells surrounding necrotic areas has been previously reported for other models, including human tuberculosis [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It would be interesting to evaluate if arginase has a causal role in lung necrosis, by indirectly affecting endothelial function in blood vessels in close proximity to granulomas [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. </p><p>Even though most studies have reported that MDSCs suppress the immune response, particularly T cells, in some recent models it has emerged that MDSCs could actually activate and induce proliferation of T cells. Interestingly and in accordance with our results, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model it was reported that MDSCs activated Th17 cells. In turn, Th17 negatively affected the outcome of EAE by increasing pathology. Mechanistically, it was shown that Th17 induction in EAE was mediated by IL-1&#x003b2;. Furthermore, a complex relationship between TH17 cells producing IL-17 and MDSCs was recently unveiled in several cancer models. IL-17 was shown to increase the MDSCs-dependent induction of chronic inflammation by production of IL-1 in the tumor microenvironments. In our model, it could be envisioned that autocrine or paracrine IL-17 produced by Gr1<sup>+</sup> or T cells, respectively could lead to inflammation and tissue damage, as well as increased bacterial burden. This uncontrolled tissue damage could also cause Gr1<sup>int</sup> cells directly suppress other T cell subsets and to recruit regulatory T cells. However, this would need further validation with either IL-17 or IL-17R knockout mice or alternatively, with anti-IL-17 therapy. Our studies denoted as the splenocyte to Gr1<sup>high</sup> or Gr1<sup>int</sup> ratio increased the percentage of CD4+ proliferation reduced. These results suggest that Gr1<sup>+</sup> subsets are either capable of suppression under these circumstances or alternatively the induced proliferation present at lower ratios was diluted out. Finally, it was recently reported that the origin of MDSCs could impact their immunomodulatory function. Whereas MDSCs obtained from a chronic peritonitis model activated T cells, peritoneal tumors induced MDSCs with suppressive functions. </p><p>MDSC have been widely reported in human patients, mostly in the context of cancer, and in fact as new data accumulates there are probably subsets of MDSC themselves. The importance of neutrophils in the human immune response to tuberculosis is becoming more widely recognized, but what proportion of these cells is actually MDSC instead has not to our knowledge been investigated. Unfortunately, human neutrophils do not express Gr1, but other markers such as CD15, CD66b, CD115 and CD124 [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], could potentially allow distinction between true human neutrophils and MDSC. The role of Gr1<sup>+</sup> cell subsets during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection merits further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Animals and infections</title><p>Six to 9 weeks old C57BL/6, NOS2 -/-, RAG2 -/-, C3HeB/FeJ and C3H/HeOuJ were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).
