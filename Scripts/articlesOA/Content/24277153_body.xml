<p>Activation of the innate response initiated by TLRs is an essential mechanism of defense against many pathogens; however, TLR can also respond to endogenous ligands, potentially leading to autoimmunity if not properly controlled. This is particularly clear for the nucleic acid receptors TLR7 and 9, which appear to mediate the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, most notably lupus. In lupus, TLR7 and TLR9 recognition of endogenous RNA and DNA, respectively, results in the production of type I IFNs and the anti-DNA and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) autoantibodies characteristic of the disease. In mice, an increased copy number of the TLR7 gene leads to a lupuslike syndrome characterized by accumulation of RNP-specific autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pisitkun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Subramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walsh et al., 2012</xref>). In lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, deletion of the TLR7 gene reduced the level of anti-RNP autoantibodies but not the level of anti-dsDNA antibodies, which depends on TLR9 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nickerson et al., 2010</xref>). These results clearly suggest that the two major classes of autoantigens targeted in lupus, DNA- and RNA-binding proteins are specifically controlled by TLR9 and TLR7, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of the lupus prone (NZBxNZW)F1 mice with a TLR7 and 9 inhibitor leads to reduced symptoms and increased survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrat et al., 2007</xref>). It is not known whether the second endosomal receptor for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), TLR8, could likewise mediate autoimmunity and, if so, which diseases would result from its dysfunction.</p><p>In humans, TLR8, like TLR7, recognizes viral RNA, self-RNA within snRNP autoantibodies complexes, and several classes of small molecule agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vollmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forsbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gantier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablasser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). However, numerous differences exist among these two receptors. TLR8 is preferentially activated by ssRNA rich in AU, whereas sequences rich in GU preferentially activate TLR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forsbach et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, TLR8 senses ssRNA through its ability to form secondary structures, a characteristic not required for TLR7 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sarvestani et al., 2012</xref>). Lastly, the pattern of expression of the two receptors differs among human blood cells. TLR7 is largely coexpressed with TLR9, primarily on B cells and PDCs (plasmacytoid DCs), whereas TLR8 is absent in these cells and abundantly expressed in monocytes, myeloid DCs (mDCs), and neutrophils (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattermann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forsbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janke et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that activation of human TLR8 by endogenous ligands might lead to a different spectrum of inflammatory disease than the one resulting from activation of TLR7 and TLR9.</p><p>Circumstantial evidence implicates a role of TLR8 in human diseases, including RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sacre et al., 2008</xref>), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D&#x000f6;ring et al., 2010</xref>), and IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prinz et al., 2011</xref>). These reports rely mostly on gene polymorphism and correlative studies. The absence of small animal models has limited studies of the disease associations of TLR8 signaling. Mouse TLR8 does not recognize ssRNA ligands, RNA viruses, or small molecules that are potent agonists for human TLR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hemmi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heil et al., 2004</xref>) a difference caused by the absence of 5 aa that are necessary for RNA recognition by human TLR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the role of self-recognition by TLR8 cannot be meaningfully studied in current mouse models of autoimmunity and a more relevant small animal model would represent a significant advantage in the field. In this study, we have thus generated multiple human TLR8 transgenic lines of ES cells and generated chimeric mice from these ES lines to study human TLR8 function in vivo.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Mice with high expression of human TLR8 develop multiorgan inflammatory syndrome</title><p>To develop a small animal model to study human TLR8 function, we generated transgenic mice expressing human TLR8 under the control of human TLR8 genomic regulatory regions. A BAC clone containing the complete human TLR7 and TLR8 genomic region was modified to delete the huTLR7 coding region, leaving only the huTLR8 gene capable of expression. Transfection of a C57BL/6 ES cell line with this construct produced many clones, four of which were selected to generate transgenic mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full.jem.20131033/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Chimeras produced from three of these clones (6, 12, and 23) developed a wasting disease, surviving from 23 and 140 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and failing to breed successfully. The level of huTLR8 mRNA expression in these chimeras correlated negatively with survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Interestingly, spontaneous disease was observed even in mice with as few as 20% of the blood cells derived from the huTLR8 transgenic ES cells, demonstrating a strong dominant biological effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Chimeras from a fourth ES clone, Clone 8, (TLR8TgCL8) had a lower level of transgene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), and bred normally, allowing establishment of a stable transgenic line on C57BL/6 background.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>huTLR8 expression level strictly correlate with decrease survival in chimeric mice.</bold> (A) Mice were generated with a varying number of copies of huTLR8.

These data demonstrate that the dependence on receptor proteolysis is preserved when human TLR8 is expressed in mouse cells.</p><p>Histopathological evaluation of the chimeras revealed inflammation in the pancreas, kidneys, liver, salivary glands, and the joints. The disease patterns in mice generated from the three independent ES clones were essentially the same, suggesting that the phenotype is due to the transgene itself, not to an insertional mutation in the host genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full.jem.20131033/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). The pancreas was the most severely affected organ and the likely cause of death in these mice, with pancreatic acinar tissue substantially effaced by inflammatory cells, primarily macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Residual islets could be identified within the inflammatory tissue, suggesting that the exocrine pancreas was the main target of the inflammatory reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, I and II; and Fig. S2, A and B).

Liver hepatic sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, VII and VIII) revealed an inflammatory reaction mainly localized in the portal triads (Fig. S2 A). The inflammatory changes associated with the bile ducts are consistent with an autoimmune origin resembling autoimmune cholangiopathy in humans.

To test these alternatives, bone marrow from each of the three independent huTLR8-expressing chimeras was transferred to irradiated congenic B6SJL mice. All reconstituted mice spontaneously developed a disease pattern remarkably similar to that observed in the chimeras, demonstrating that the expression of huTLR8 in the hematopoietic compartment is sufficient to generate the full spectrum of inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Similar to what is observed in the chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), huTLR8 gene expression level in the BM-transplanted animals correlated negatively with survival (Fig. S2 C). No difference was found in either the number or activation state of T cells in the BM of huTLR8Tg chimeras, compared with BM from WT mice, suggesting that disease in reconstituted mice did not result simply from the transfer of effector T cells (unpublished data). Organs of the reconstituted mice showed a pattern of severe inflammation in pancreas, liver, and salivary glands comparable to that in chimeric huTLR8Tg mice, and pancreas failure was similarly considered the primary cause of death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Patients affected by these diseases have a dysregulated production of IL-1&#x003b2; and can be successfully treated with inhibitors of the IL-1 pathway. The triggering factors and the innate receptors responsible for this increase in IL-1&#x003b2; are, however, not yet defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mellins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pascual et al., 2005</xref>). TLR8 mRNA expression was significantly higher in blood cells of both SoJIA and Still&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of TLR8 mRNA correlated positively with the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>) in these patients, which was not the case with mRNA for TLR7 or TLR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). The correlation of both IL-1&#x003b2; production and disease activity with TLR8 expression is further supported by the normalization of TLR8 mRNA in SoJIA patients treated with the IL-1 receptor antagonist, Anakinra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>, cohort 2). A similar increase was found in purified monocytes from SoJIA patients with active disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>) but not in neutrophils (not depicted), suggesting that difference in TLR8 expression level in whole blood is not simply a reflection of altered peripheral blood populations.

Despite some significant species differences between rodents and human in TLR expression patterns, much of this knowledge has been gained from studies performed in mouse models of autoimmune disease or gene-targeted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ewald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mouchess et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walsh et al., 2012</xref>). TLR8 belongs to the same family as TLR7 and TLR9, but its role in disease has yet to be elucidated due to the lack of an appropriate animal model to study its function in vivo. Interpretation of the role of TLR8 in inflammation has relied mostly on work performed on mouse TLR7, which shares with human TLR8 its ability to detect ssRNA in the endosome but has a different cellular distribution and some different ligand specificity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forsbach et al., 2008</xref>) and likely in vivo. We showed that activation of the TLR8 signaling pathway in human blood results in a predominant proinflammatory gene signature, whereas activation of TLR7 is associated with a type I IFN response, demonstrating that the cellular distribution of these two receptors is an essential element of their biology. In addition, understanding the role of TLR8 has proven difficult as the mouse TLR8 seems to differ from its human orthologue due to the lack of 5 aa that are key for RNA recognition.</p><p>Here, we generated mice expressing functionally active huTLR8 with a similar expression pattern to that in human leukocytes. The severity of the specific phenotypes closely correlated with the expression levels of huTLR8 and relatively small difference in its expression lead to inflammation in multiple organs.</p><p>Pancreas failure was likely the primary cause of death of huTLR8Tg chimeras. The histological features of the involved pancreas showed similarity with primary autoimmune pancreatitis in humans (AIP), including a dense leukocyte infiltration consisting of T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils associated with large areas of interstitial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zandieh and Byrne, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, huTLR8Tg mice develop extrapancreatic lesions in organs often affected in AIP patients, including salivary glands inflammation, glomerulonephritis, and inflammation in the portal area of the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finkelberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zandieh and Byrne, 2007</xref>). Although it is difficult to accurately compare the levels of huTLR8 in these transgenic animals to the levels in human cells, our data clearly demonstrate that the inflammatory status is directly proportional to level of huTLR8 expression. One may predict that in humans, increased level of huTLR8 expression or possibly improper intracellular compartmentalization might lead to loss of immune tolerance.</p><p>huTLR8Tg chimeras developed spontaneous joint inflammation and the stable line expressing lower huTLR8 levels is more susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis as compared with syngeneic WT mice. It is interesting that the difference with syngeneic animals only occurs once disease is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). A possible scenario is that the initial process of joint injury induces the release self-RNA&#x02013;peptide complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>). Infiltrating or resident macrophages would respond to this self-RNA through huTLR8, but not mouse TLR8, leading to increased production of proinflammatory mediators, which further enhance the disease process in transgenic mice. This suggests that huTLR8 is not involved in the initial phase of disease, but becomes a key player in the maintenance phase. In patients with systemic arthritis, we found an increased level of TLR8 in PBMCs of SoJIA patients and in patients with Still&#x02019;s disease. Such increase could be caused by differences in cellular composition, but we observed a similar increase in purified monocytes from patients and a significant correlation with IL-1&#x003b2;. Interestingly, TLR8 expression levels is not regulated by IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-6, thought to be a primary abnormality associated with systemic arthritis, in what could have been a positive feedback loop in these patients suggesting a different mechanism leading to TLR8 increased expression. Our observations using the transgenic mice have highlighted the dramatic impact of a slight increase in TLR8 expression on the overall state of inflammation in vivo. The similar high expression level of TLR8 in patients with arthritis thus argues for a role of this receptor in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>We took advantage of the coexistence in the blood of the chimeras of WT H2d cells and H2b-TLR8-bearing cells and demonstrated a selective activation of huTLR8-expressing DCs and monocytes, indicating that huTLR8 signaling exerts a cell-intrinsic effect. A possible contributor to the DC and monocyte activation in huTLR8Tg chimeras are the elevated levels of anti-RNP Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), which can activate the receptor in virtue of their high affinity for ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vollmer et al., 2005</xref>). However, DCs and monocytes are similarly activated in BM-transplanted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>) which have undetectable levels of anti-RNP (data not shown), suggesting that these cells sense other type of RNA ligands or at least that anti-RNP IC are not exclusively responsible for their activation. In the majority of huTLR8Tg chimeras, huTLR8-DC activation is paralleled by a preferential activation of H2b T cells. Notably, in few of the very sick animals analyzed, we found over 80% of T cells with an effector memory phenotype, and in these cases both H2b cells and H2d T cells were activated to a similar extent (data not shown). Thus, a process initially confined to cognate activation of T cells by huTLR8-DC can ultimately involve noncognate activation of T cells once the response reaches certain intensity. In the transgenic mice, activated DCs and monocytes infiltrating the pancreas, might be exposed to self-antigens in a highly stimulatory environment which can lead to T cell activation. It is therefore possible that the inflammatory process, initially geographically restricted to the pancreas or another organ, would results to a rapidly progressing disease in other organs in a T cell dependent manner. Construction of more sophisticated models to be able to simultaneously track TLR8 expression and activation in the early phase of the disease are required to clarify this point.</p><p>Although it is well known that huTLR8 recognize and gets activated by ssRNA, a key question is to better understand which ligands activate the receptor in vivo to induce such a dramatic break of tolerance and where does this happen first. The receptor is not constitutively active as spontaneous production of cytokines was not observed after in vitro culture of PBMCs from any of the transgenic lines. The sensing of extracellular RNA is also unlikely since in transgenic animals, huTLR8 required receptor proteolysis in the endosome for its activity. As shown recently for TLR9, the proteolytic processing in the endolysosomal compartment is an essential mechanism to avoid recognition of extracellular self-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ewald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mouchess et al., 2011</xref>) and mice expressing a form of TLR9 which no longer requires receptor proteolysis for activation, sense extracellular self-DNA and die of a fulminating form of anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mouchess et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, there is no obvious basis for chemical differences between mouse and human RNA and it is thus unlikely that the receptor is activated by a specific mouse RNA ligands not present in humans. However, we cannot exclude that sequence motifs preferentially recognized by huTLR8 might be more represented in mice than in humans. Another possibility is that huTLR8 is activated by virus or microbe RNAs not present in humans. However, in mice transplanted with huTLR8Tg&#x02013;bone marrow, the disease severity was greatly accelerated, a phenomena that likely resulted from the abundance of self-RNA released as a consequence of the massive cell-death induced by the radiation, rendering the hypothesis of a specific mouse pathogens less plausible.</p><p>Previous work has shown that increased expression of TLR7 is sufficient, independently of any other genetic lesions, to break tolerance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walsh et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, transgenic mice for the D34 mutation in the chaperone protein Unc93B1 preferentially transport TLR7 versus TLR9 in the signaling endosome and develop autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukui et al., 2011</xref>). In both cases, mice developed a massive lymphoproliferation. Surprisingly, we did not observe myeloid cell expansion or any signs of lymphoproliferation in the huTLR8Tg mice. On the opposite, lymphopenia not lymphoproliferation characterized these animals, suggesting a profound difference between TLR8 versus TLR7.</p><p>Other disease traits significantly differentiate the consequence of increased huTLR8 versus TLR7 signaling in mice. TLR7Tg mice develop glomerulonephritis, liver necrosis, and a severe form of anemia, whereas pancreas, joints, and salivary glands are not affected, rendering the glomerulonephritis aspect of the diseases as probably the only common trait between the two models. In the TLR7Tg mice, absence of B cells is sufficient to abrogate the entire spectrum of symptoms, including DC activation and expansion, demonstrating that excessive TLR7 signaling in B cells drives the disease in this model. In the huTLR8Tg mice, it is unlikely that B cells play a similar central role to the disease. In fact, B cells in these mice express very low huTLR8 and don&#x02019;t expand or infiltrate the involved organs. The increased levels of nucleic acid&#x02013;specific antibodies in the huTLR8Tg mice, however, suggest a break of B cell tolerance in both DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, but this phenomena happened late in the disease pathogenesis in the chimeras and was absent in the BM-transplanted animals. Mechanistically, it is more likely that DCs and macrophage activation plays the critical step in the initiation of the inflammatory process by producing proinflammatory cytokines such TNF, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6, which can mediate end organ damage, and promoting Th1 priming and differentiation of CD8 T into IFN-&#x003b3;/TNF-producing cells. Although the overexpression of either TLR7 or huTLR8 in mice leads to a strong inflammatory response and disease symptoms, the phenotype of the mice is thus drastically different. This is quite puzzling, as both receptors recognize ssRNA and one would predict a similar inflammatory response linked to increase expression. Some of the key differences were the targeted organs but also the cellular response. This could be caused by intrinsic differences in the biology of these receptors but it is tempting to postulate that the cellular distribution of these receptors is the key differentiation element. In the huTLR8Tg mice, TLR8 is restricted to myeloid cells, whereas TLR7, in addition to myeloid cells, is also present in B cells, T cells, and PDCs. The cellular distribution of TLR8 in the transgenic mice is similar to the human, at least in the hematopoietic compartment, which makes the mice a relevant model to study TLR8 biology. Mouse TLR8 does not deliver an activation signal but is critical to control mTLR7 expression and as such prevents the occurrence of TLR7-driven autoimmunity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demaria et al., 2010</xref>). In line with these findings, we observed a marked reduction in mTLR7 expression in cellular subsets expressing huTLR8. This could constitute a mechanism to prevent the simultaneous expression of both receptors behind a certain threshold level. The presence of TLR7 in myeloid cells in mice indeed suggests that it compensates for the lack of a functional TLR8 in mice, whereas in humans, both receptors are expressed in different cell types and induce a qualitatively different inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, using novel human TLR8 transgenic mice, we have identified TLR8 as a key player in autoimmune inflammation in human diseases and defined a link between TLR8 and arthritis both in mouse models but also in patients. Our data provide for the first time some clear understanding of the difference in the in vivo biology of TLR7 versus TLR8 and argue for the importance of restricting excessive TLR7 or TLR8 response in vivo pointing to the existence of sophisticated mechanisms controlling level of recognition of self-RNA in endosomes by these two receptors. We believe that we have uncovered the role of TLR8 in human autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which identifies TLR8 as a key potential target for clinical development</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Reagents.</title><p>TLR8 agonist stabilized immunomodulatory RNA (ORN8-liter; 5&#x02032;-M2UGCUGCUUGUG-/glycerol/-GUGUUCGUCGUM2-5) was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lan et al., 2007</xref>) and synthetized by Chemgenes Corporation.
