<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a critical component for protection against intracellular pathogens. Upon infection, the innate immune response provides resistance and initiates the development of antigen-specific lymphocytes including cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which ultimately kill host cells harboring pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Harty1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> has been used for decades as a model organism to investigate the generation of CMI, as infection induces a robust effector and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response that restricts bacterial growth following a lethal secondary challenge, resulting in long-lived sterilizing immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Pamer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although it is generally agreed that activation of the innate immune system is critical for the initiation of adaptive immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Schenten1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, the specific signaling pathways necessary to elicit a robust protective immune response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> remain poorly understood.</p><p>
<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is detected by multiple innate immune signaling pathways during infection <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Witte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Following engulfment by macrophages and dendritic cells, the bacteria reside within phagosomes where they are detected by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), resulting in the activation of MyD88-dependent response genes <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Leber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Mice lacking both MyD88 and STING were also protected upon secondary challenge, indicating that not only is STING dispensable for the generation of a protective response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, it does not act in a redundant fashion with the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway. Conversely, when STING activity was enhanced either by administering c-di-AMP during immunization or using a bacterial mutant that secretes elevated levels of c-di-AMP, mice failed to immunize and had decreased numbers of antigen-specific T cells following reinfection. This suppressive effect was largely due to the induction of type I IFNs since IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient mice immunized with either ActA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Lm-OVA in the presence of c-di-AMP or the <italic>tetR</italic> mutant were protected.

One possibility is that the uptake of type I IFN-induced apoptotic cells by macrophages results in the release of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Carrero1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, mice administered c-di-AMP did not have detectable levels of IL-10 in the serum. Furthermore, similar to B6 mice, IL-10-deficient mice immunized in the presence of c-di-AMP were unable to elicit OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following challenge (<bold>data not shown</bold>). Thus, IL-10 is not the downstream effector of STING/type I IFN-mediated suppression of adaptive immunity in our model of protective immunity. Other mechanisms including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated T cell suppression, which is upregulated by type I IFN <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, may play a role in c-di-AMP-mediated inhibition of immunity.

One possibility is that there are STING-independent sources of type I IFNs in response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that MyD88/STING-deficient macrophages produced low levels of IFN-&#x003b2; eight hours post infection. Recent studies found that RIG-I-deficient cells had reduced IFN-&#x003b2; secretion in response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection suggesting that RNA from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can be detected by the host <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Abdullah1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Hagmann1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Thus, RIG-I-dependent, STING-independent induction of type I IFNs via IRF3 and IRF7 may also contribute to the inhibition of protective immunity. Another possibility is that since na&#x000ef;ve IRF3/7- and IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient mice exhibit heightened bacterial clearance compared to both na&#x000ef;ve B6 and STING-deficient mice, innate immune factors are also likely restricting reinfection.

In previous studies, we found that a <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> strain engineered to activate the inflammasome, and consequently induce high levels of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, was a poor inducer of adaptive immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Sauer2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Furthermore, co-administration of heat-killed or LLO-deficient <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> blocked immunity to WT bacteria in a MyD88-dependent manner <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Bahjat2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Thus, activation of three distinct signaling pathways, STING, MyD88, and caspase-1 all resulted in the inhibition of the development of adaptive immunity. Therefore, there appears to be a dichotomy between innate immune pathways that are necessary for survival (for example, MyD88 for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and type I IFN for viruses), and those that lead to adaptive immunity. In fact, our data and work from others suggest that lack of inflammation represents an ideal environment for the generation of memory T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Condotta1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Badovinac1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Indeed, mice deficient for both MyD88 and STING are fully immunized by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> even though there was a significant reduction of dendritic and T cell activation and cytokine production following immunization.</p><p>Considering that the innate immune response is believed to be required for the initiation of adaptive immunity, we were surprised that MyD88/STING-deficient mice immunized with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> were protected after reinfection. This raises the question, which innate immune signaling pathways contribute to the initiation of T cell priming to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>? Previous work from our group found that NOD2 detects cytosolic <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003861-Leber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, immunized MyD88/NOD1/2-deficient mice clear bacteria upon secondary lethal challenge (<bold>data not shown</bold>), suggesting that protective immunity is not due to redundancy between MyD88 and NOD-like signaling pathways. Future studies to identify which innate immune detection pathways are required for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-mediated CMI would provide a greater understanding of how pathogens and adjuvants elicit protective immunity, knowledge that can be used for the development and improvement of vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
