<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phagosomes are crucial components of the innate and adaptive immune systems (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Jutras and Desjardins, 2005</xref>). The process known as &#x02018;phagosome maturation&#x02019; involves a series of coordinated fusion events that lead to biochemical changes in the composition of a phagosome. Multiple intracellular compartments contribute to this pathway through dynamic events of fusion and cargo delivery. Thus, the entire machinery that regulates phagosome maturation is strongly linked to proteins that organize intracellular trafficking, such as Rab proteins and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor adaptor proteins receptors (SNAREs) (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Fairn and Grinstein, 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that cytokines modulate the outcome of phagosome maturation in myelocytic cells (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Balce et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">O'Leary et al., 2011</xref>). Interferon- &#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) is a key cytokine that plays multiple roles during the activation and modulation of intracellular trafficking, especially in macrophages (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Montaner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">Schroder et al., 2004</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; endows macrophages with the ability to control the immune function of phagosomes by stimulating phagosome maturation (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">Nathan et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Santic et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Santic et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">Schaible et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">Via et al., 1998</xref>). However, in the same cells, IFN-&#x003b3; also delays phagosome maturation and acidification at early time points (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Jutras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Trost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Tsang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al., 2007</xref>). This transient delay observed in macrophages is important for the adaptive immune response, because the slow degradation of peptide antigens is crucial for proper antigen cross-presentation in macrophages (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Jutras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Trost et al., 2009</xref>). Although much is known about the role of IFN-&#x003b3; in phagosome biology, little is known about the molecular machinery by which IFN-&#x003b3; modulates phagosome trafficking and function.</p><p>Regulators of intracellular trafficking represent a potential molecular link between the activation of immune cells by cytokines and phagosome transport (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Pei et al., 2012</xref>). Rab proteins are small GTPases that play a central role in phagosomal trafficking as well as in fusion between phagosomes and various compartments (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Fairn and Grinstein, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the expression of multiple Rab proteins is modulated during the activation of macrophages, making Rab GTPases good candidates for mediating the cytokine control of phagosome maturation (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Pei et al., 2012</xref>). Although &#x0003e;20 Rab proteins are associated with phagosomes, a defined role in phagosome biology is only known for a few of them (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In this context, the presence of immune-regulated Rab cascades that control cytokine-dependent phagosomal function could represent an attractive mechanism of regulation as shown for endocytosis and exocytosis (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Jean and Kiger, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Pfeffer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the Rab proteins, Rab20 is an especially promising candidate for being a regulator of an IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent mediator of phagosome trafficking. Rab20 was originally described as being mainly associated with endocytic organelles (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000fc;tcke et al., 1994</xref>). This small GTPase was proposed to regulate the trafficking of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and connexin 43 (Cnx43, also known as GJA1) (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Curtis and Gluck, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Das Sarma et al., 2008</xref>). Proteomic studies have shown that Rab20 is recruited to phagosomes in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Trost et al., 2009</xref>). In resting macrophages, overexpressed Rab20 associates with phagosomes, and the expression of the dominant-negative mutant of Rab20 impairs phagosome maturation (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Egami and Araki, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with a central role of Rab20 in immunity, the expression of this GTPase is highly upregulated after infection with different bacterial pathogens in multiple systems (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Goldmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Mahapatra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Tailleux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">van der Sar et al., 2009</xref>). However, a functional role for this GTPase in immunity remains to be identified.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of Rab20 in the context of phagosome maturation and its modulation by IFN-&#x003b3;. We found that IFN-&#x003b3; enhanced the association of Rab20 with phagosomes in macrophages. This recruitment of Rab20 into phagosomes induced an early and transient delay in phagosome maturation. By contrast, either the expression of dominant-negative Rab20 or Rab20 depletion accelerated phagosome maturation and proteolytic activity, prematurely disassociating Rab5a from phagosomes. We show that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of Rab5a, Rabex-5 (also known as RABGEF1) is also an effector of Rab20, and the recruitment of Rab20 to phagosomes through IFN-&#x003b3; signaling increased the association of Rabex-5 with phagosomes. Additionally, Rab20 depletion impaired the association of both Rabex-5 and Rab5a with phagosomes. Collectively, our data reveal a newly identified Rab cascade in phagosomes, in which IFN-&#x003b3; induces Rab20-dependent recruitment of Rabex-5, which in turn transiently increases the recruitment of Rab5a to phagosomes, resulting in a delay in phagosome maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Early association of Rab20 with phagosomes is enhanced by IFN-&#x003b3; in macrophages</title><p>Endogenous Rab20 was recruited to phagosomes in RAW264.7 and primary bone marrow macrophages (BMM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1A,C</xref>). A quantitative analysis of the association of Rab20 with phagosomes indicated that the levels of association decreased from 15&#x02005;min to 60&#x02005;min. Remarkably, the association of Rab20 with phagosomes was significantly higher after treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1B,D</xref>). In dynamic studies, by using live-cell imaging of macrophages expressing EGFP&#x02013;Rab20, it was possible to precisely determine that EGFP&#x02013;Rab20 was recruited into phagosomes after actin dissociation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1A,B</ext-link>) and remained associated with early phagosomes for &#x0223c;20&#x02005;min (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1C,D</ext-link>), suggesting a function for Rab20 in early phagosomes. To confirm this hypothesis, IgG-coated latex-bead phagosomes were purified at different time-points from macrophages (that were either treated with IFN-&#x003b3; or left untreated) and analyzed by western blotting. Rab20 was associated with purified phagosomes during the first 30&#x02005;min at relatively low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1E</xref>). Strikingly, the association of Rab20 with phagosomes significantly increased after IFN-&#x003b3; treatment. Thus, IFN-&#x003b3; treatment increased the early recruitment of Rab20 to phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1E,F</xref>). As expected, Rab5a was also associated with early phagosomes and dissociated at 60&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1E</xref>). Moreover, IFN-&#x003b3; increased and extended the recruitment of Rab5a to phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1E</xref>). Immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of macrophages confirmed that IFN-&#x003b3; enhanced the recruitment of Rab20 onto phagosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x02005;1G,H</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that IFN-&#x003b3; stimulates the recruitment of Rab20 to phagosomes at the very early steps after internalization.</p><fig id="f01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Rab20 association with early phagosomes in IFN-&#x003b3;-activated macrophages.</bold> (A) Analysis of the association of endogenous Rab20 with phagosomes in RAW264.7 macrophages.

A constitutively active mutant of Rab20 was not used in these studies because Rab20 has an unusual arginine in place of the glutamine at position 59 in the alpha-3 (switch II) region. Therefore, the GTPase activity of this mutant requires further characterization before its use in functional studies (data not shown).</p><p>First, cells were labeled with Lysotracker Red (LTR), and the association of the fluorescent signal with phagosomes was measured at the single phagosome level. In EGFP-expressing macrophages, phagosomes acquired LTR at &#x0223c;10&#x02005;min and reached a plateau after 25&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2A,B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Movie 1</ext-link>). In macrophages expressing EGFP&#x02013;Rab20, phagosomes did not acquire LTR during the first 25&#x02005;min, and this time-window correlated precisely with the period in which EGFP&#x02013;Rab20 was present on phagosomes. After EGFP&#x02013;Rab20 dissociated from the phagosomes, they started to acquire LTR and reached LTR levels that were comparable to those of the EGFP-expressing control after 60&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2A,B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Movie 1</ext-link>). This delaying effect was specific for Rab20, because the overexpression of EGFP&#x02013;Rab5a did not affect LTR acquisition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1E&#x02013;G</ext-link>).

When another marker of maturation, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Bohdanowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">Vieira et al., 2001</xref>) was tested, we found, as shown previously (<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">Vieira et al., 2001</xref>), that PI3P resided in phagosomes of mCherry-expressing macrophages for the first 10&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2C,D</xref>). However, in macrophages expressing mCherry&#x02013;Rab20, the association of PI3P with phagosomes was significantly prolonged, correlating with the presence of EGFP&#x02013;Rab20 on phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2C,D</xref>). By contrast, the association of PI3P with phagosomes in Rab20T19N-expressing macrophages lasted only &#x0223c;5&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2C,D</xref>). Additionally, the delivery into phagosomes of Texas-Red-conjugated 70-kDa dextran (Dex70kDa) that had been preloaded into late endocytic organelles started after 10&#x02005;min in EGFP-expressing macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2E,F</xref>). However, in macrophages expressing EGFP&#x02013;Rab20, the delivery of Dex70kDa into phagosomes was completely blocked during the first 60&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x02005;2E,F</xref>). By contrast, in Rab20T19N-expressing macrophages, the delivery of Dex70kDa proceeded significantly faster than in EGFP-expressing cells. Collectively, these data indicate that early phagosome progression is delayed by Rab20 overexpression.

First, IFN-&#x003b3; increases the early recruitment of Rab20 to phagosomes, which has functional consequences. Previous studies have suggested that Rab20 might function in phagosome maturation (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Egami and Araki, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 2011</xref>). Using three different approaches to monitor phagosome progression by live-cell imaging, we demonstrated that LTR acquisition, PI3P dissociation and cargo delivery are all transiently impaired when high levels of Rab20 are associated with phagosomes. The expression of Rab5a is stimulated by IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Dominguez and Stahl, 1998</xref>); however, we observed that the effect of Rab20 is specific, because the overexpression of Rab5a, which, like Rab20, is associated with early phagosomes, does not modify phagosome maturation rates. By contrast, the expression of the dominant-negative mutant Rab20T19N and Rab20 knockdown accelerates phagosome maturation. In contrast to our results, it has been reported that LTR acquisition and cathepsin D recruitment to phagosomes is reduced in chemically fixed cells expressing the Rab20 dominant-negative mutant (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Egami and Araki, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 2011</xref>). These conflicting data might, in part, arise from differences between experimental systems. Monitoring phagosome maturation is difficult due to the asynchronous and dynamic nature of phagosomal interactions. Thus, live-cell imaging is crucial to visualize rapid and transient changes of individual phagosomes. Because Rab20 is associated with phagosomes at a very early stage, we focused on the events occurring during this phase in live macrophages. This was important because Rab20 and Rab20T19N expression had no effect at later time-points e.g. after 2&#x02005;h of internalization, as observed here, and as reported previously (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Egami and Araki, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the idea that, in macrophages, IFN-&#x003b3; induces an early delay in phagosome maturation. It has been observed that, in IFN-&#x003b3;-activated macrophages, there is a delay in the progression of phagosomes to phagolysosomes (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Tsang et al., 2000</xref>). The acidification rate, proteolytic activity (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al., 2007</xref>) and the acquisition of LAMP-1, lysozyme-C and &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Jutras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Trost et al., 2009</xref>) by early phagosomes is reduced by IFN-&#x003b3;. Here, we provide functional evidence indicating that the reported delay in maturation and proteolytic activity is, in part, due to increased levels of Rab20 in phagosomes. Rab20, in turn, transiently recruits Rabex-5, thereby increasing the levels of active Rab5a on phagosomal membranes. Compelling evidence also indicates that the early phagosomal delay has an important physiological function. In macrophages, relative slow phagosomal acidification and antigen degradation is crucial for efficient peptide antigen cross-presentation (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Jutras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Trost et al., 2009</xref>). Even very subtle differences in acidification have a profound impact on proteolysis events occurring in phagosomes (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). Our observations support the idea that small temporal changes mediated by Rab20 during phagosome maturation result in crucial changes in its function. However, the relevance of Rab20 function to antigen presentation or other phagosomal activities remains to be demonstrated. We postulate that IFN-&#x003b3; has at least two effects on phagosomal functions; one is the relatively early delay in phagosome maturation and the second, operating later, is the enhancement of phagosomal maturation. In this context, Rab20 contributes to the early phagosomal functions of IFN-&#x003b3; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><p>According to the data presented here, the Rab5a nucleotide exchange factor Rabex-5 is also an effector of Rab20. This is not the first time that a specific effector is identified as being shared by more than one Rab protein (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Colucci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">De Renzis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref>). Systems in which one particular Rab GTPase recruits an effector that sequentially modifies another Rab protein that is present in the same organelle have been reported in multiple trafficking pathways (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Pfeffer, 2013</xref>). The results of proteomic studies performed on isolated latex-bead phagosomes suggested that multiple Rab cascades coexist in this organelle (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez, 2013</xref>). Here, our data reveal one &#x02018;phagosomal Rab cascade&#x02019; that involves the recruitment of Rab20, which in turn recruits the Rab5a GEF Rabex-5. This recruitment temporally increases the levels of Rab5a in phagosomes, extending the positive Rabex-5&#x02013;Rab5a feedback, thereby transiently delaying phagosome maturation. Thus, we suggest that the Rab20-dependent recruitment of Rabex-5 to phagosomes temporally enhances the Rabex-5&#x02013;Rab5a positive feedback (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.144923/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3</ext-link>). Therefore, the time needed to override the positive feedback and to undergo the transition from Rab5 to Rab7 is longer (<xref rid="b4600" ref-type="bibr">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>), leading to a transient delay in phagosome maturation. Clearly, more studies are needed to investigate how Rab5a activation is shut down and to determine the identity of the Rab proteins that mediate IFN-&#x003b3; function at later stages.</p><p>Importantly, we demonstrate that this sequential recruitment is regulated by IFN-&#x003b3;, a key cytokine for the activation of macrophages. Thus, our study contributes to a better understanding of the link between the immune activation of macrophages and the control of phagosome function. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms of cytokine control might exist for currently unidentified phagosome-associated Rab cascades. Such unidentified Rab cascades might operate during phagosome maturation to modulate the multiple immune functions of this organelle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>RAW264.7 macrophages were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, catalog number TIB-71) and maintained in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (D-MEM, 4.5&#x02005;g/l glucose) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, PAA, Pasching, Austria) and 2&#x02005;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (PAA).

The 8-bit color movies were then ready for further quantification. To quantify the fluorescence association with the phagosomes, the corresponding fluorescent-channel movies were loaded into ImageJ. A circle enclosing the phagosome in the brightfield image was drawn by using the &#x02018;Elliptical selection&#x02019; tool.

The position and the size of the circle were adjusted manually with the movement of the phagosome in the different frames. In experiments on Lysotracker acquisition and 70-kDa dextran delivery, the absolute integrated intensity was plotted by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA). In experiments on PI3P association and Rab5a association, the expression level of EGFP&#x02013;2xFYVE and EGFP&#x02013;Rab5a was different in the different biological replicates. To take this effect into account, the fluorescence intensity of EGFP&#x02013;2xFYVE and EGFP&#x02013;Rab5a was normalized to the intensity of a region of the same size in the cytoplasm.
