<sec sec-type="intro" id="h0.0"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> causes tularemia, a zoonosis, with sporadic human infections. Although tularemia does not represent a significant public health problem in the United States, <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> is considered a category A bioterrorism agent due to high rates of infectivity and mortality following pulmonary infection (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). An investigational vaccine, denoted Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), was derived from <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>holarctica</italic> (also known as type B [1]), a less virulent strain of <italic>Francisella</italic> present in Europe and Asia. Vaccination with LVS ameliorates disease to some degree in professional workers (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and vaccination with other attenuated <italic>Francisella</italic> strains has resulted in some protection against tularemia in Russia (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), where type B <italic>Francisella</italic> is endemic. However, the extent of protection provided to humans by LVS against <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>tularensis</italic> (also denoted type A), the most virulent strain, is not well known in humans. Partial protection is obtained when LVS-vaccinated mice are challenged parenterally with a low dose of type A <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and when LVS-vaccinated humans are challenged by aerosol (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Currently, other new vaccines against tularemia are being developed, and some appear to be comparable to LVS in protecting against type A <italic>Francisella</italic> in animal models (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, it remains difficult to extrapolate results obtained in animal models to predict vaccine efficacy in humans without a thorough understanding of the immune response against <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic>. For instance, for infection with bacteria such as <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic>, for which human clinical trials are unpractical or unethical, regulatory approval of new vaccines might be pursued via the &#x0201c;Animal Rule&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Application of this option implies the need to evaluate vaccine efficacy in animal studies and then bridge efficacy and doses to humans without exposing human subjects to the bacteria. A limiting factor in extrapolating the results of animal studies to humans is the lack of knowledge about correlates of protection against <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Many infections caused by encapsulated bacteria or toxins induce humoral immune responses that correlate with protection (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In contrast, measurement of serum antibodies alone has not correlated with protection against <italic>Francisella</italic> infection. As with other intracellular pathogens, resistance to <italic>Francisella</italic> infection appears to depend heavily on T cell-based immune responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>An issue in determining correlates of protection against intracellular bacterial infections is the nature of methodologies that are used to quantify T cell activities. In general, T cell functions are elicited by <italic>in vitro</italic> activation, followed by measurement of activities such as proliferation, production of cytokines, or cytotoxicity. Proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays (ELISPOT), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for cytokine production and killing assays are commonly accepted methodologies, especially for experimental group comparisons, but these assays are complex, and different variables may strongly influence the results. To date, no mediator measured after T cell stimulation, such as gamma interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;), has proven to be a useful correlate. Thus, the identification of factors that may be quantified and correlated with immune status remains problematic.</p><p>Recently, we developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue culture methodology that couples <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of T cells obtained after vaccination with a panel of LVS-related vaccines, control of intramacrophage LVS growth, and quantitation of relative gene expression. In this <italic>in vitro</italic> coculture method, control of intramacrophage bacterial growth depends on immune T cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We demonstrated that the ability of immune T cells to control <italic>in vitro</italic> intramacrophage bacterial replication correlated with <italic>in vivo</italic> vaccine efficacy against systemic challenge (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Further, transcriptional analyses of recovered splenocytes allowed the identification of immune mediators that were differentially expressed, and that also correlated with <italic>in vivo</italic> vaccine efficacy. At least some of these mediators were likely not just biomarkers but also involved in controlling bacterial replication <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as protection <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mediators detected by this approach included IFN-&#x003b3; and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), whose important roles in controlling <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> infections have already been described (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additional studies have now validated the biological functions of other potential correlates of protection that were identified, including interleukin 6 (IL-6) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), T-bet (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and IL-12R&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In mice, LVS introduced intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously is lethal (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In contrast, LVS introduced via skin sites or by respiratory administration establishes a sublethal vaccinating infection, with dissemination of bacteria to spleens, livers, lungs, and lymph nodes. In the present report, we built on previous studies to validate these correlate approaches by examining the relative functions of cells from other involved organs, namely, liver and lung. We further assessed the role of vaccination route in detecting correlates. Finally, using both <italic>in vitro</italic> data on the control of intramacrophage LVS replication and gene expression analyses of selected correlates of protection, we identified mathematical approaches to quantitatively model correlates of protection. The best models combined both types of measurements, and thereby yielded excellent discrimination between vaccinated mice which were protected to different degrees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="h1.1"><title>Control of intramacrophage LVS growth during coculture by <italic>Francisella</italic>-immune liver and lung cells after differential vaccination.</title><p>To determine whether lymphocytes derived from livers and lungs exhibit differential control of <italic>in vitro</italic> bacterial replication, similar to splenocytes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we vaccinated C57BL/6J mice with LVS-derived vaccines that provide different degrees of protection. Mice were vaccinated (i) with 10<sup>4</sup> LVS, the most-protective vaccine, (ii) with 10<sup>4</sup> of the moderately protective opacity variant LVS-R, or (iii) with the equivalent of 10<sup>8</sup> heat-killed LVS (HK-LVS), which is poorly protective. Four to 6&#x000a0;weeks after vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of 10<sup>6</sup> LVS i.p. As expected, mice vaccinated with LVS survived lethal LVS challenge, but nonvaccinated mice did not. Mice vaccinated with LVS-R and HK-LVS exhibited on average 50% and 5% survival, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). These results confirmed the relative hierarchy of protection provided by these vaccines against lethal i.p. LVS challenge, which in turn reflected the hierarchy of protection against subcutaneous (s.c.) challenge with fully virulent type A <italic>Francisella</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In parallel with survival studies, single-cell suspensions from spleens, livers, and lungs were prepared from mice vaccinated with LVS, LVS-R, or HK-LVS or from naive mice. In evaluating the yield and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations obtained from each organ, there were no differences between those in naive mice and those from any of the vaccinated groups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> therefore shows the distribution of lymphocytes obtained from the three organs, using results pooled from naive mice and from mice vaccinated with LVS, LVS-R, and HK-LVS. NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells, including both natural killer (NK) cells and NK T cells, comprised a higher proportion of liver leukocytes compared to splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). In contrast, CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, comprised of macrophages and, to a lesser extent, dendritic cells and neutrophils, comprised a higher proportion of lung preparations compared to spleen and liver leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). The total numbers of lymphocytes obtained from livers or lungs were much lower than those obtained from spleens; yields from livers averaged about 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> per mouse, and those from lungs were about 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> per mouse, with correspondingly smaller amounts of each subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). Lymphocytes from immune mice were then compared for <italic>in vitro</italic> activities by adding them to LVS-infected macrophages, and the impact on replication of LVS bacteria over time in <italic>in vitro</italic> coculture was determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>, cells derived from livers and lungs of mice vaccinated with different vaccines exhibited patterns of control of intramacrophage bacterial replication similar to those exhibited by splenocytes: spleen and liver lymphocytes derived from LVS-vaccinated mice were the most efficient, followed by those from LVS-R-vaccinated mice and then those derived from HK-LVS-vaccinated mice, which were the least efficient. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>, lung lymphocytes from some groups (e.g., LVS-R) were usually less efficient in controlling intramacrophage LVS growth than either splenocytes or liver lymphocytes.

Spleen, liver, and lung cells were cultured for 2&#x000a0;days with LVS-infected macrophages. Cells were then recovered and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. Most of genes exhibited similar expression patterns in liver lymphocytes and splenocytes, which correlated with vaccine efficacy. As observed previously using immune splenocytes, expression of most of these genes was higher in liver and lung cells derived from LVS-vaccinated mice than in cells from LVS-R and HK-LVS-vaccinated mice, and their expression was higher than in either cell type obtained from nonvaccinated mice. In particular, in immune liver cells, the expression profiles of IFN-&#x003b3;, Il-18bp, IL-27, IL-6, and SOCS-1 was related to the vaccines&#x02019; hierarchy. In addition, a few genes, including those for TNF-&#x003b1;, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-22, were more strongly upregulated in liver lymphocytes than in splenocytes, particularly in cells from the LVS-vaccinated group. T-bet was also strongly upregulated in spleen and liver cells from LVS-vaccinated mice, compared to its levels in cells from LVS-R and HK-LVS-vaccinated mice. The degree of differences between vaccine groups was smaller for the remaining genes in all 3&#x000a0;cell types.

Compared to splenocytes from i.d.-vaccinated mice, splenocytes from i.n.-vaccinated mice exhibited differential patterns of gene expression only for IL-27 and T-bet, and to a lesser extent GM-CSF. These mediators were expressed at higher levels in LVS-derived splenocytes than in splenocytes from LVS-R- and HK-LVS-vaccinated mice. In addition, a few more genes (e.g., the TNF-&#x003b1; gene) were more upregulated in the LVS and LVS-R groups than in the HK-LVS group; other genes (e.g., the IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18bp genes) were more upregulated in the LVS group, but there were no differences between levels of expression in the LVS-R and HK-LVS groups. However, for the remainder of the genes, few differences were observed between the three groups. The more subtle difference between splenocytes from i.n. vaccinated mice is illustrated by IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression, whose median level in splenocytes derived from mice vaccinated i.n. with LVS was only 11.5-fold higher than its level in splenocytes of nonvaccinated mice. This is much less than the 52-fold upregulation observed in cells from mice vaccinated with LVS i.d. Taken together, these data indicate that spleen, liver, and lung lymphocytes obtained following i.n. and i.d. vaccination possess similar abilities to control intramacrophage bacterial growth. However, cytokine production and relative gene expression did not entirely correlate between splenocytes of i.d. and i.n. vaccinated mice, likely reflecting different biological

However, biological or technical variability in any single parameter may limit robust correlations between vaccine efficacy and <italic>in vitro</italic> data. To overcome this problem, we examined the mathematical models of multivariate analyses to distinguish nonvaccinated and differentially vaccinated groups of mice. Using results from splenocytes of naive and i.d. vaccinated mice, a large number of logistic regression models were fitted to normalized data from one, two, or three variables. Variables used were control of intramacrophage bacterial replication (as reflected by CFU data) or normalized relative gene expression of selected mediators. Five types of models were considered, and associated parameters were calculated (see Materials and Methods). Analyses of relative gene expression of the panel of 12 genes confirmed our previous findings (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Not surprisingly, the gene whose expression best distinguished between naive mice and mice from any vaccine group, as well as between vaccine groups, was IFN-&#x003b3;, but relative expression of IFN-&#x003b3; alone did not always distinguish well between cells from naive mice and cells from mice vaccinated with HK-LVS or mice vaccinated with LVS-R versus with LVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6A</xref>). We observed a different, but still imperfect, pattern of separation between vaccine groups when CFU data were subjected to the same type of analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6B</xref>); in this case, the resulting model successfully discriminated between the LVS group and the LVS-R group. Notably, when Spearman correlation analyses were performed between any two variables, numbers of CFU were not strongly related to the relative gene expression of any individual mediator, except IFN-&#x003b3;, for which there was a significant inverse correlation with numbers of CFU (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material). The latter results imply that control of intramacrophage CFU levels reflect a mechanism(s) that is largely independent of the expression of any single cytokine gene, except IFN-&#x003b3;. Therefore, we next integrated the CFU data with the gene expression data, either individually or in multiple combinations; groups of two or three cytokine genes without CFU data were also analyzed. A model combining IFN-&#x003b3; and CFU data separated almost all groups but did not differentiate between responses from the naive mice and HK-LVS-vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6C</xref>). Notably, combinations of two mediators, such as IFN-&#x003b3; and T-bet, or several combinations of three genes distinguished well between most vaccination groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>). However, the strongest separation with the best <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;values, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;values, and cross-validation (CV) values resulted from combining CFU data with expression data from two cytokine genes, such as T-bet and GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6D</xref>).

For infections such as these for which field trials are difficult, the identification of correlates of protection may represent the most feasible means to extrapolate efficacy to humans. However, at present there are no validated methods for predicting vaccine-induced protection for <italic>Francisella</italic> or any other intracellular pathogen. Different approaches have been investigated, particularly in studies of <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic>, but have not yet been successful. Although Th1 immune responses are readily induced by <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection or <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG vaccination, neither IFN-&#x003b3; production nor TNF-&#x003b1; production has correlated with protection against tuberculosis in either animal studies or clinical trials (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). More recently, multifunctional cytokine-producing T cells (MFCs) have been proposed to correlate with vaccine efficacy (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Although BCG vaccination appears to provide better protection against tuberculosis in children than in adults (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), both children and adults immunized with BCG exhibited similar levels of <italic>ex vivo</italic> cytokine production and MFC frequencies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and in BCG-vaccinated babies neither parameter correlated with protection against disease (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>As in <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infections, T cell-mediated Th1 immune responses are considered essential to provide protective immune responses against infections with <italic>Francisella</italic>, but correlates are unknown. Enesl&#x000e4;tt and colleagues (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) discriminated between <italic>Francisella</italic>-immune people and nonimmune people by developing T cell signatures, based on assessing the ability of <italic>in vitro</italic>-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to proliferate and to produce Th1-related cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; and MIP-1&#x003b2;. Similarly, using a mouse model, the systemic production of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and MCP-1 within a few days after vaccination with attenuated type A <italic>Francisella</italic> mutants of different efficacies partially predicted the degree of protection against respiratory type A challenge, but measurement of serum antibodies did not (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, some evidence indicates that antibody responses may contribute to protection against <italic>Francisella</italic>. The relative importance of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses appears to vary according to the use of different animal models and types of vaccine (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Nonetheless, anti-<italic>Francisella</italic> antibody levels alone have generally not been useful in predicting protection following either tularemia infection or vaccination in people (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Using a mouse model, we previously discriminated between vaccines of different efficacies against systemic (i.p.) LVS challenge by analyzing the ability of <italic>Francisella</italic>-immune splenocytes to control intramacrophage LVS replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, which further correlated with upregulation of certain genes during coculture (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Future studies will be needed to examine the relationship between control of intramacrophage bacterial growth, gene expression, and respiratory (aerosol or intranasal) challenge. Of note, while control of intramacrophage replication of fully virulent strains of <italic>Francisella</italic> is obviously of interest, the much faster replication rate <italic>in vitro</italic> of strains such as type A <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> SchuS4 limits the sensitivity of this coculture system, and thus we have used LVS as a surrogate infecting agent (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This is further supported by our previous observation that mice vaccinated with LVS, LVS-G, LVS-R, or heat-killed LVS exhibit the same hierarchy of protection against challenge with either LVS i.p. or SchuS4 i.d. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the present report, we show that the properties originally identified using splenocytes are representative when analyzing lymphocytes from other nonprofessional immune organs that are colonized during anti-<italic>Francisella</italic> vaccination, namely liver and lung. The <italic>in vitro</italic> coculture approach is intended to model <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions in tissues between infecting bacteria, their target host cells (in this case, macrophages), and responding lymphocytes, in which the presumed goal of the interactions is to limit bacterial replication and spread (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In these cocultures, only T cells are active, although <italic>in vivo</italic> other lymphocytes likely regulate interactions and thus have been routinely included in assays (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The proportion and therefore number of T cells (both T cell receptor &#x003b2;-positive [TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>] CD4<sup>+</sup> and TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells) added to cocultures were higher among <italic>Francisella</italic>-immune splenocytes than among liver and lung lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). Thus, splenocytes might be expected to effect stronger control and differential gene expression, but this was not always the case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>), implying other informative biological differences.</p><p>We therefore considered it important to perform detailed comparisons of splenocytes to lymphocytes from other involved tissues, where vaccine-induced control of subsequent infections would be required. Liver is obviously not considered an immune organ, but it is well equipped to protect itself from pathogens, particularly bacterial endotoxin, while tolerating foreign antigens (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These needs are met by both resident immune cell populations with relatively more innate immune cells, particularly NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophage-like Kupffer cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), as well as recruited effector lymphocytes regulated by liver-specific combinations of adhesion molecules (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). During infections of mice with LVS, lesions in the liver are dominated by Gr-1<sup>+</sup> Mac-1<sup>+</sup> immature myeloid cells and major histocompatibility complex class II-positive (MHC-II<sup>+</sup>) Mac-1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), but the functions of liver T lymphocytes have only rarely been studied (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The present data suggest that despite the somewhat different compositions of cells in the different preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>), the viability of LVS-immune liver lymphocytes in cocultures, the recovery of viable T cells, the quality of mRNA obtained, cytokine production, and, ultimately, functions in terms of intramacrophage growth control are also comparable to those of splenic lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Similarly, relative gene expression patterns in <italic>Francisella</italic>-immune liver cells were similar to those of <italic>Francisella</italic>-immune splenocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>) and reflected the <italic>in vivo</italic> hierarchy of vaccine protection. A few genes, including TNF-&#x003b1;, GM-CSF, and IL-22, were more strongly upregulated in liver lymphocytes than in splenic lymphocytes. We are currently investigating whether these gene expression differences are due to different distributions of T cell subpopulations in liver and spleen and/or reflect different biological activities of liver lymphocytes.</p><p>The lung is obviously a critical site for interactions between respiratory pathogens and the immune system, with even fewer resident lymphocytes than other organs but abundant alveolar macrophages. Upon aerosol exposure to <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic>, cytokines produced by macrophages and dendritic cells play critical roles in controlling the initial infection and promoting adaptive T cell responses (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The functions of lung lymphocytes during infections, however, have received relatively less attention (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These cells are difficult to study <italic>ex vivo</italic>, particularly when longer time frames in tissue culture are of interest. Here, the numbers and health of lung lymphocytes recovered after 2 to 3&#x000a0;days of <italic>in vitro</italic> coculture were suboptimal; only 10 to 20% were viable, and the quality of RNA purified from lung cells was also reduced, as reflected by a consistently lower RNA integrity number (calculated by Agilent Bioanalyzer software [data not shown]). Despite these suboptimal qualities, a hierarchy of control consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> protection was still evident: LVS-immune lung cells controlled intramacrophage bacterial growth more efficiently than those cells derived from HK-LVS- and LVS-R vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), which was reflected by similar patterns of IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). The extent of that control, however, was typically less for lung lymphocytes from each vaccine group than for the respective spleen and liver samples. This observation is consistent with previous findings, which demonstrated that lower numbers of lymphocytes in the cocultures still controlled bacterial replication well (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and illustrates the sensitivity of the methodology. However, differences in relative levels of gene expression in lung lymphocytes obtained after different vaccinations were less evident in lung lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). This likely reflects the lower proportion of T cells in lung lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>) and the lower quality of mRNA obtained (see above; data not shown), combined with potential biological differences between organs. The technical issues likely limit full evaluation of lung T cell activities and mRNA. However, as illustrated by the substantial upregulation of IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>) and corresponding production of IFN-&#x003b3; protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>) in cocultures with lung lymphocytes, protein quantification of selected cytokines by ELISA may be a valid alternative.</p><p>Different routes of vaccination induce qualitatively different immune responses under many circumstances, including different responses by cells in involved organs. For example, mice vaccinated with BCG and then boosted i.d. with a recombinant adenovirus expressing <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> Ag85A exhibited strong splenic Th1 T cell responses in spleens compared to those not boosted, but exhibited no improvement in controlling an aerosol challenge; in contrast, those boosted i.n. had improved control of aerosol <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> challenge but weak splenic responses (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Here, LVS-R provided better protection against i.p. challenge <italic>in vivo</italic> when administered i.n. than when administered by i.d. vaccination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Improved protection by LVS-R administered i.n. might involve factors not reflected by <italic>in vitro</italic> cocultures, such as mucosal barriers and mucosal antibody responses that may alter LVS-R dissemination and systemic immune responses. Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> control of intramacrophage bacterial growth and IFN-&#x003b3; production was similar between all types of cells obtained after i.d. vaccination and i.n. vaccination, but differences in relative gene expression between vaccine groups were more subtle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>) when splenocytes from i.n. vaccinated mice were studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> and reference <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Of the 12 candidate correlate genes tested, only IL-27 and T-bet exhibited clear patterns of differential expression in splenocytes from i.n. vaccinated mice. Further studies will be necessary to evaluate whether qualitatively different lymphocyte functions develop after different vaccination routes and/or whether the frequency of LVS-specific T cells is lower in spleens from i.n. vaccinated mice than in those from i.d. vaccinated mice. Such results may suggest that cells from organs other than spleen may better reflect respiratory vaccination.</p><p>Finally, we propose an approach to quantitatively model correlates of protection, by applying multivariate analyses to integrate results generated from the measurements of intramacrophage bacterial replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and from the quantification of gene expression by <italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic>-specific T cells. Separately, these two methods have several advantages: the <italic>in vitro</italic> coculture methodology is highly sensitive but may occur via a number of mechanisms, while relative gene expression by lymphocytes provides information regarding individual mediators. By combining data from these two complementary methodologies, we identified several models that strongly differentiate degrees of vaccine efficacy. In ongoing studies, we are exploring the value of adding measurements of serum anti-LVS antibodies, which would provide another complementary method that is distinct from cell-mediated immunity, to further improve prediction of protection. Of note, a major, and unique, goal of this approach is not only to distinguish between &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;failed&#x0201d; vaccinations but also to estimate the relative proportion of protected people within a population. Further, these models may aid in refining the list of candidate correlate mediators so that the biological relevance of each individual mediator during protection against lethal challenge with LVS, and with fully virulent tularemia, can be investigated separately (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Further, the models may facilitate the identification of useful markers of vaccination, even if the mediators in question are not essential during protective responses. Most importantly, the models may represent a practical approach to evaluate and monitor correlative anti-<italic>F.&#x000a0;tularensis</italic> immune responses after vaccination.</p><p>Because relative gene expression is influenced by the sources of cells under study and by vaccination route, additional potential markers and mechanistically important mediators may be identified by further study of different tissue sites. We propose that the <italic>in vitro</italic> coculture strategy is useful not only for exploring such mechanisms but also for functional clinical assays. In tuberculosis studies, similar approaches often referred to as &#x0201c;mycobacterial growth inhibition assays&#x0201d; have shown promise in evaluating mouse (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and human (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) immune responses to vaccination or infection and potentially in predicting protection. These include formats such as use of human peripheral blood cells and whole blood, which can lead to transcriptional signatures and be informative in clinical settings (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). To that end, we are currently evaluating the functions of mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Indeed, PBLs obtained from mice vaccinated with LVS control the intramacrophage replication of LVS as effectively as LVS-immune splenocytes, and exhibit upregulated expression of a panel of genes similar to those detected in LVS-immune splenocytes (R.&#x000a0;De Pascalis, L.&#x000a0;Mittereder, N.&#x000a0;J.&#x000a0;Kennett, K.&#x000a0;L.&#x000a0;Elkins, unpublished results). The success demonstrated here therefore justifies further development of this approach, with the goal of advancing to human studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="h3.1"><title>Experimental animals and design.</title><p>Six- to 12-week-old wild-type male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME.
