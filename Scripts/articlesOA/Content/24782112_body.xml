The failure to eradicate TB by available measures calls for novel intervention strategies based on deeper insights into pathophysiological processes underlying active disease. A unique IFN signature in blood leukocytes has recently been described in active TB <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> raising questions about the role of IFN I in TB pathogenesis and whether IFN I modulation can be harnessed for immune intervention.</p><p>Type I IFN performs multiple functions in immunity and inflammation <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Consistent with this multifunctionality is the ubiquitous expression of its receptor (receptor for IFN I, IFNAR1) and its propensity to induce complex autocrine and paracrine signaling cascades <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. IFN I has well-assigned protective functions in viral infections. In bacterial infections, these effects depend on the microbial habitat. Generally, IFN I is considered detrimental in diseases caused by intracellular bacteria <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, including TB. Experimental studies in TB-resistant mice report heightened IFN I induction by clinical isolates of Mtb with increased virulence <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and fatal TB progression upon exogenous delivery of IFN I inducers <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. However, Mtb infection of mice deleted of IFNAR1 resulted in inconclusive results <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, likely as a consequence of different infection routes with impact on tissue-dependent disease processes.</p><p>Besides the IFN I and II gene expression signatures in blood leukocytes revealed in TB, cross-regulation of IFN I and IFN II was recently described in leprosy, another mycobacterial disease affecting skin, mucosa, and the peripheral nervous system <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. IFN interdependence was identified in skin specimens and found to imprint polarization of tuberculoid or lepromatous lesions. Mtb primarily affects the respiratory parenchyma, an environment with distinct immune regulation. In resistant mice, inhibition by IFN I of IL-1 cognates in isolated immune cells <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, and IFN-driven recruitment of Mtb-permissive mononuclear cells during pulmonary TB, were observed <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Yet, the precise biological functions of IFN I at the site of infection in progressive TB remain elusive. We embarked on dissecting the cellular and molecular effects of IFN I in pulmonary TB.</p><p>We found that the lethally TB-susceptible phenotype of 129S2 mice, which resembles primary progressive TB, can be rescued by IFNAR1 deletion. Susceptibility correlated with exacerbated inflammation, which was ameliorated in the absence of IFN I signaling. Early during infection, IFN I signaling fostered Mtb replication and triggered accelerated dissemination of tubercle bacilli to recruited phagocyte populations while diminishing alveolar macrophage (AM) lung content. Functional IFNAR1 on both hematopoietic and tissue-resident cells was critical for fatal inflammation. This process was initiated by heightened cell death events within AM populations, elevated chemokine release, and enhanced recruitment of detrimental neutrophils into the airways before onset of adaptive immunity. These novel insights into TB pathogenesis provide guidelines for future immune intervention strategies for progressive TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Signaling via IFNAR1 is detrimental in TB and promotes inflammation</title><p>We investigated downstream effects of IFNAR1 signaling on TB in highly susceptible 129S2 mice (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A and B; Supporting Information Fig. 1A and B) and their counterparts with deleted IFNAR1 (<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). Mice were infected with a low dose of Mtb (&#x0223c;200 CFUs) via the aerogenic route. The 129S2 mice gradually lost weight and most of them died within 40 days postinfection (p.i.), whereas <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals survived acute and chronic TB (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A; Supporting Information Fig. 1C). The absence of IFN I signaling ameliorated lung inflammation, as monitored by lung/body weight ratio (Supporting Information Fig. 1D) and improved protection against Mtb compared to WT 129S2 controls (129S2 WT; Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B and C). This was accompanied by milder tissue pathology, namely smaller inflammatory foci in the lung parenchyma, observed in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to that observed in 129S2 WT controls at 21 days p.i. (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>D). As the disease progressed, these differences became more prominent (Supporting Information Fig. 1E). Large necrotic lesions developed in 129S2 WT mice by 25 days p.i., but not in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals. The milder pathology in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals was accompanied by a lower, albeit insignificantly reduced, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, a systemic indicator of tissue destruction at 21 days p.i. (Supporting Information Fig. 1F). Stronger iNOS expression in WT lung tissue (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>E) suggests that improved control of Mtb replication in the absence of IFN I signaling was independent of local NO production, a well-known antimycobacterial effector molecule in mice. In a complementary approach, the TB-resistant C57BL/6 mice and their <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> counterparts were infected with a higher but still sublethal inoculum of Mtb (&#x0223c;500 CFUs). <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were protected from TB at day 40 p.i., as revealed by significantly reduced Mtb growth in lungs (Supporting Information Fig. 2A) and they controlled acute and chronic infection when exposed to low-dose Mtb (Supporting Information Fig. 2B). Together, our data demonstrate that IFNAR1 signaling is detrimental in murine TB, independent of the genetic background of the mice. Moreover, it appears that IFN I dictated susceptibility to TB in 129S2 mice.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Signaling through IFNAR1 is detrimental in TB.

To determine whether absence of IFNAR1 impacts on T-cell responses during TB, we isolated leukocyte populations from infected lungs and analyzed them by flow cytometry (see Supporting Information Fig. 3A for gating strategy). The frequencies and numbers of Mtb (purified protein derivative) specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T-cell populations and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T lymphocytes were comparable between <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and controls (Supporting Information Fig. 3A and B). These results argue against profound effects of IFN I signaling on T-cell responses in TB. Intact IFNAR1 signaling resulted in increased innate immune inflammation (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>), but left adaptive immunity apparently unaffected (Supporting Information Fig. 3). Consequently, we analyzed the kinetics of innate myeloid cells in lungs. We enumerated various myeloid populations in lung tissue at 14 and 21 days p.i. using flow cytometry (see Supporting Information Fig. 4A for gating strategies). Significantly more inflammatory macrophages (iMs) and PMNs were counted in WT mice by day 21 p.i. (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>A).

The frequency of AMs did not differ in na&#x000ef;ve animals, and was only apparent following Mtb infection, ruling out developmental defects in AM differentiation (Supporting Information Fig. 4B).

The absence of IFNAR1 in BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) markedly affected production of CCL2 and CCL5, but left CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 unaffected (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>A). The CXCL2 and CCL3 production by Mtb-infected PMNs did not differ (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>B). We subsequently determined the abundance of chemokines in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) early during infection. BALF from WT mice contained more CXCL1 and CXCL5 compared to <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> samples (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>C), whereas CXCL2, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 were below the detection limit in both groups. Frequencies of PMNs were decreased in BALF of <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>D). In TB-resistant mice (C57BL/6), we did not observe early IFNAR1-dependent recruitment of PMNs into the alveoli, even when mice were infected with sublethal infection doses (Supporting Information Fig. 4D). CXCL5 is produced exclusively by the respiratory epithelium <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, while CXCL1 can also be produced by myeloid cells <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The stimuli for inducing CXCL5/CXCL1 release by pneumocytes could be of bacterial or host origin. Concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, known regulators of CXC chemokine secretion by pneumocytes, in BALF were reduced and did not differ at 14 days p.i. (data not shown). However, we observed significantly higher cell death rates, in BALF of WT mice, exclusively at 14 days p.i. (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>E; Supporting Information Fig. 4E). We subsequently determined the frequencies of annexinV<sup>+</sup>7AAD<sup>+</sup> cells within BALF to identify the myeloid cell population(s) affected by cell death (see Supporting Information Fig. 5A for gating strategy). In agreement with the nucleosome measurements, we observed higher frequencies of dead leukocytes among WT cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>F). These observations were recapitulated by AMs, the major myeloid population within airways at this time point of infection. Although higher numbers of PMNs were recruited to the bronchoalveolar space of WT mice, their death rates were below those observed for <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>E). Endogenous ligands liberated by dying cells are potent activators of CXC chemokines <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and probably contributed to PMN recruitment in the presence of IFN I during TB. Thus, our data suggest that heightened local cell death concurrent with IFN I stimulation of nonhematopoietic cells induced PMN recruitment into the alveoli, promptly after bacterial invasion. At later time points, recruitment of iMs and PMNs was perpetuated by IFNAR1-dependent release of CCL2/CCL5 or CXCL2/CCL3 from macrophages or PMNs, respectively.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>IFN I signaling modulates chemokine release, cell death, and early neutrophil dynamics in TB.

Despite similar bacterial loads in lung homogenates, we detected higher bacterial burdens in BAL cells collected from WT animals (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). To identify myeloid cells that could serve as a replicative niche for Mtb in the presence of IFNAR1, we infected BMDMs, BM dendritic cells and ex vivo-isolated lung macrophages (LMs). In BM-derived resting and IFN-&#x003b3;-activated cells, the growth kinetics of Mtb were similar between WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, while lung-purified macrophages revealed minor differences (Supporting Information Fig. 6A). In a subsequent approach, we investigated bacterial growth in AMs. Numbers of Mtb were elevated at 48 h p.i. in ex vivo-isolated WT AMs (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>B), despite similar phagocytic capacities at 4 h p.i. (Supporting Information Fig. 6B). To further assess the preferential Mtb growth in presence of IFNAR1 in vivo, we infected mice with GFP-expressing Mtb H37Rv and determined by flow cytometry the frequencies and numbers of GFP<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells within alveoli (see Supporting Information Fig. 5B for gating strategy). At 14 days p.i., overall bacterial loads in lung parenchyma were similar (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>E), but proportions of AMs-containing Mtb were higher in WT mice (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>C). Percentages of infected PMNs were similar between mouse strains, suggesting that the absence of IFNAR1 did not affect bacterial uptake by these cells. The propensity of isolated BMs and spleen PMNs to phagocytose mycobacteria in vitro was indeed similar in WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (Supporting Information Fig. 7).

The higher numbers of Mtb-containing WT PMNs was a consequence of a combination of increased Mtb replication in WT AMs, increased in situ cell death and more abundant CXCR2 ligands at the site of bacterial invasion. We conclude that Mtb spreads more severely from AMs to lung-infiltrating myeloid phagocytes in WT mice and preadaptive immune events within alveoli are controlled by IFNAR1. The pathogenic role of PMNs recruited early upon infection was underlined by the profound consequences of PMN depletion on TB susceptibility. Mice receiving Abs against Ly6G for 1 week, starting day 7 p.i., survived in a similar manner as <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>H). We conclude that IFNAR1 impacts on Mtb replication in myeloid cells, induces distinct compartmentalization of Mtb among phagocytes in the early phase of infection, and fosters accumulation of PMNs with immunopathologic functions.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>IFN I signaling drives Mtb spreading in lung phagocytes.

Here, we demonstrate that IFN I fosters lung inflammation in primary progressive TB, and establish a direct link between IFNAR1 signaling and disease immunopathology. These effects were most obvious in highly TB-susceptible 129S2 mice. Shortly after infection, IFN I promoted intracellular Mtb replication, diminished AM numbers, and caused a distinct compartmentalization of Mtb within myeloid cells. By controlling in situ cell death and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by lung parenchyma cells, IFNAR1 induced early PMN accumulation in alveoli and, later on, recruitment of both iMs and PMNs to the Mtb-infected lung. IFN I drove exacerbated tissue damage and promoted Mtb dissemination, thereby benefiting the pathogen.</p><p>To contest the role of IFN I in TB, we harnessed lethally TB-susceptible mice. The 129 mouse genotype family comprises various substrains <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> with varying TB susceptibility <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. For our investigations, we selected the substrain 129S2 (129SvPas), which has been used for generation of the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis confirmed the congenic status of the control strain (data not shown). IFN I was a critical component of the high TB susceptibility of the 129S2 mice because IFNAR1 deletion was essential and sufficient for conversion of a susceptible to a resistant phenotype. Deletion of IFNAR1 further heightened TB resistance in C57BL/6 mice, though less dramatically. Our data emphasize a crucial role of IFN I in hyperinflammation during TB and demonstrate an early detrimental effect of IFNAR1 in TB susceptibility. The 129S2 mice could serve as model for primary progressive TB pathogenesis in susceptible human hosts.</p><p>Exacerbated inflammation and lethality of Mtb-infected 129S2 mice was independent from IFN I effects on adaptive Th1 responses. Our finding agrees with previous observations that Poly I:C-induced IFN I worsens TB without affecting T cells <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. We also did not detect impaired CD8 T-cell functions, consistent with previous observations in aged Mtb-infected 129 mice <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Our data exclude aberrant adaptive T-cell immunity, including Treg responses, as a cause of excessive inflammation in this model. This conclusion is also aligned with the marginal effects on T cells reported in Mtb-infected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants with resistant C57BL/6 background <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Rather, we discovered that IFN I regulates myeloid cell recruitment into the Mtb-infected lung, with iM and PMN infiltrations accompanying TB disease progression. Treatment with Poly I:C, an IFNAR1-independent activator of IFN I production, has been shown to drive exclusive iM accumulation in the lung parenchyma in a CCL2/CCR2-dependent manner <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In TB-resistant C57BL/6 mice, IFNAR1 regulates recruitment and survival of CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>lo/neg</sup> monocytes <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. It appears that exogenous stimuli for IFN I and Mtb infection trigger different pathways, which depend of host genotype. Profound variability has been observed in IFNAR1-driven tissue recruitment of myeloid cells in different diseases, implying that pathogen-specific signatures shape downstream innate immune responses. In postinfluenza streptococcal pneumonia <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and polymicrobial sepsis <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, IFN I constrains access of PMNs to tissue sites through interference with leukotriene pathways and modulation of CXCL1/2 release. In contrast, infection with <italic>Chlamydia muridarum</italic><xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>
<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, and prolonged sterile inflammation <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> cause IFN I-dependent influx of PMNs and iMs leading to exacerbated inflammation, similar to TB described here. Recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells is orchestrated by CCL2, CCL7, CCL12, CXCL1, and CXCL2 under these conditions. IFNAR1-competent macrophages infected with Mtb released abundant CCL2 and deletion of IFNAR1 did not alter CXC chemokine release by myeloid cells in vitro. The early source of PMN chemoattractants in airways was lung-resident cells, as indicated by the abundance of CXCL5 in BALF. Propensity of pneumocytes to release CXCL5 is controlled by recognition of bacterial signatures in TB <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Mtb sensing by pneumocytes is likely accelerated when AMs undergo cell death, as noticed for 129S2 WT mice. Later during Mtb infection, increasing numbers of PMNs secreting CXCL2 and CCL3 likely created a positive feedback, promoting additional IFNAR-dependent leukocyte recruitment to the lung. Thus, CXC chemokine-releasing tissue-resident cells along with hematopoietic cells, which release Mtb upon death, are the IFNAR1-dependent drivers of early leukocyte recruitment in the TB-susceptible hosts. Despite reduced bacterial loads at 6 weeks p.i., we did not observe early PMN accumulation in the airways of resistant WT (C57BL/6) mice compared to their <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> counterparts, as noticed for 129 mice. These results suggest that kinetics of the immune response differs between strains, and careful selection of the animal model is called for when addressing TB pathogenesis.</p><p>Intriguingly, despite similar overall lung bacterial burdens early during infection, we detected a unique Mtb compartmentalization in airway myeloid cells in TB susceptible mice, which was triggered by augmented Mtb replication concurrent with cell death of AMs. How exactly IFN I offers a replicative advantage to Mtb at the cellular level and what the precise cell death processes affected by IFN I are, remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, IFNAR1-driven necroptosis, a highly inflammatory cell death, was reported for the intracellular pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>
<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, and recently described in the zebrafish model of TB <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. In our TB-susceptible mouse model, higher frequencies of Mtb<sup>+</sup> AMs and abundant cell death correlated with increased levels of CXC chemokines. The accelerated accumulation of IFNAR1-competent PMNs into the alveoli during early TB, synchronous with limited frequencies of annexinV<sup>+</sup>7AAD<sup>+</sup> PMNs, suggests that IFN I drives recruitment of PMNs to the site of infection via chemokines, rather than causing heightened PMN cell death. Yet a role for cell death in limiting PMN numbers in absence of IFNAR1 cannot be excluded. Although IFN I did not alter the intrinsic phagocytic capacity of PMNs, we detected higher numbers of Mtb<sup>+</sup> PMNs in BALF from WT mice early during infection suggesting that distinct compartmentalization was due to heightened Mtb availability at the time of accelerated PMN migration to the port of Mtb entry. This early surge in bacterial uptake was critical for TB disease outcome as determined by disease amelioration in TB-susceptible 129S2 mice following PMN depletion. The deleterious role of PMNs as disease dissemination elements in TB is supported by their capacity to release cytokines and chemokines, notably TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, CCL3, and CXCL2 <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, which impact on accumulation of Mtb-permissive phagocytes. In addition, PMNs could migrate and directly promote spread of mycobacteria <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.</p><p>Only a minor proportion of the 5&#x02013;10% of Mtb-infected individuals will develop active TB during lifetime. In the vast majority, the pathogen is successfully controlled over long periods of time. We provide evidence that IFN I drives primary TB progression and propose that IFNAR1 profoundly impacts on the outcome of postprimary TB, with excessive IFN I secretion aggravating PMN-driven disease (re)activation. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the biological relevance of IFN I signaling in lung immune and nonimmune cells during mycobacterial insult. Due to the severe inflammatory responses caused by aberrant IFN I signaling, we assume that Mtb takes advantage of IFN signaling pathways to intensify inflammation to its own benefit. This notion is supported by TB reactivation observed following antiviral IFN I therapy <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. The apparent beneficial effects of IFN I therapy in adjunct to conventional TB chemotherapy <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> may be due to resuscitation of dormant Mtb, as only actively replicating, not dormant Mtb is susceptible to TB drug treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, our data emphasize a central role of IFN I in pulmonary TB, with detrimental consequences of aberrant IFN I production for the host. IFN I effects emerge from both hematopoietic and tissue-resident cell populations suggesting a more productive crosstalk between these cell types than previously anticipated. The consequences of these events at the site of the infection are early mycobacterial dissemination and accumulation of harmful inflammatory PMNs. Increased understanding of IFN I-driven pathology can promote rational design of immunomodulatory interventions in TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice and Mtb infection</title><p>Mice, 129S2 (129SvPas), <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> in 129S2 background <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>
