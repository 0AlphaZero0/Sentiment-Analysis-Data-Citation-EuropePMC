<sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) may be regarded as the most successful intracellular bacterium worldwide, in view of its world prevalence and distribution. MTB ranks as the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Indeed, about 8.7 million incident cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (range, 8.3 million to 9 million), equivalent to 125 cases per 100,000 population, were registered globally in 2011.<xref rid="b1-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite availability of antituberculous drugs for the last 50 years Mth is responsible for 1.5 million deaths every year with about one third of the world population having been in contact and latently infected.<xref rid="b1-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Since its first characterization by Robert Koch at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century,<xref rid="b3-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> intense efforts have led to the characterization of the manifold interactions of M. tuberculosis with the immune system, to a renewed study of its metabolism for the identification of new specific pathways subject to inhibition by new drugs, to the discovery of the mechanisms it uses to divert host defences and to the understanding of the broad spectrum of soluble factors and cells involved in its control.</p><p>Despite relevant advances over the last 20 years in our understanding of the broad outlines of mechanisms contributing to protective immunity to M. tuberculosis, relevant scientific and clinical challenges remain. The development of vigorous and apparently appropriate immune response upon infection with M. tuberculosis in humans and experimental animals conflicts with failure to eradicate the pathogen itself and with its ability to undergo clinical latency from which it may exit causing the bulk of overt clinical tubercular disease in everyday clinical life. In particular, our incomplete understanding of mechanisms potentially allowing complete eradication of M. tuberculosis once infection has taken place, and of those failing during latency - thus leading to reactivation of M. tuberculosis only in a subset (10&#x02013;15%) of latently infected subjects<xref rid="b4-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> - represent major hurdles towards effective second-generation vaccines and targeted treatment of latency.</p><p>The classical view of immunity to M. tuberculosis mainly recognizes participation of macrophages and cells of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes) in the control of mycobacteria. From a clinical standpoint, our views on MTB infection may take advantage from updating the overall perspective, that has quite changed over the last decade, following remarkable advances in our understanding of the manipulation of the immune system by M. tuberculosis and of the innate component of the immune response. Over recent years, it has indeed become clear, that, in addition to adaptive mechanisms, innate immune responses are recruited by and against M. tuberculosis according to the time-frame of response recognizing early and late events after MTB entry.</p><p>The purpose of the present review is not to provide a comprehensive review of TB immunology, nor to provide in depth focus on the mechanisms of M. tuberculosis virulence and pathogenicity which appear elsewhere<xref rid="b5-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> rather, scope of this review is to highlight the different actors of the immune response against M. tuberculosis and the major mechanisms of MTB escape and to provide a supplementary translational perspective for the interpretation of innate immune mechanisms with particular impact on clinical aspects. Renewed frameworks of interpretation of results from human and animal research and from clinical observations will help the updating and understanding of M. tuberculosis immunopathogenesis and facilitate the design of new vaccines, drugs and prevention strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Correlates of the Immune Response to <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic></title><p>Active Tuberculosis (TB) encompasses a range of clinical presentations and disease courses. Active TB occurs in two stages, either as the natural evolution of overwhelming <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication following initial infection (Primary or primary-progressive TB), or resuming after a latent infection/containment of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that may last many years following exposure (post-primary TB or reactivated TB). Both primary and post-primary TB occurs in only a minor fraction of those at risk, as a consequence of several factors that include both innate and adaptive immune responses. Primary TB is detected in up to 20% of those exposed to M. tuberculosis airborne inoculum, and post-primary TB with reactivation of M. tuberculosis from latency occurs at a rate of 0.1&#x02013;0.5% per year with an estimated 5&#x02013;10% lifetime risk of developing active TB.<xref rid="b4-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b7-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This heterogeneity of individual responses is associated to different immunogenotypic characteristics (extending from innate immune responses to adaptive immune control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) and is highlighted by the non-human primate model (<italic>Cynomolgus macaque</italic>, <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) of experimental bronchial inoculation of a fixed MTB inoculum.<xref rid="b8-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Here, a whole spectrum of outcomes and pathological findings were observed, similar to what occurs after acute infection in humans. The outcomes of instillation of a defined inoculum was invariably infection, however the spectrum of pathology included macaques that progressed rapidly and succumbed to active disease, others that developed active disease over a more chronic course (including one who spontaneously resolved the infection), and those that displayed no evidence of disease even though they were clearly infected and had clinical characteristics similar to latent TB in humans. The heterogeneity of the host immune response extends beyond primary TB, and applies particularly to latent TB in humans -where only between 20&#x02013;50% of latent close contacts of TB cases develop Tubercolin Skin Test (TST) reactions and 1&#x02013;2% of these close contacts eventually develop active TB<xref rid="b9-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> - and to latent TB in cynomolgus macaques.<xref rid="b8-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b11-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, latent TB is reflective of a heterogeneous group of individuals:<xref rid="b12-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> a) those who have <italic>subclinical disease</italic>, b)those who will progress to <italic>primary active disease</italic>; c) those who maintain <italic>persistent, lifelong infection</italic>; d)those who temporarily suppress infection but later develop active TB, possibly as a result of immunosuppression or some other event (i.e., <italic>true latent infection</italic>); e) those who are able -either through innate or adaptive immunity or the combination-to effectively clear the pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-mjhid-6-1-e2014027">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, no test is currently available to differentiate latent from active TB disease, as TST and interferon gamma-release assays (IGRA) simply report the presence of specific T cell responses irrespective of the clinical condition. Furthermore, there is no test to identify those latently infected individuals who may progress to active TB or those who have subclinical disease. Also in this case TST and IGRA do not help discriminate different clinical courses.</p><p>The ability to identify those individuals with latent TB who are at risk of reactivation would help target preventative therapy and devise individualized target treatment thereby increasing adherence and minimizing toxicity and costs. Using transcriptional profiling of leukocytes in whole peripheral blood by microarray analysis, a characteristic neutrophil-driven IFN-inducible 393 transcript-signature has been identified in patients with active TB.<xref rid="b13-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This transcript signature disappears by 2 months of effective treatment and correlates with the extent of radiographic involvement. Interestingly, 10&#x02013;20% of patients with TB latency have a transcript signature similar to those with active disease. Although not proven yet, these patients might represent the minority of latent TB who will eventually progress to active TB years later. Leukocyte or purified cell population transcriptional analysis - also in other areas of chronic infections including HCV<xref rid="b14-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> - is likely to become a useful future tool to identify the subset of patients with true latency who will develop post-primary reactivation and for whom chemoprophylaxis - or rather treatment - may be mandatory. The precise labelling of patients with different types of latency using molecular or immunological tools represents one of the main future challenges to individualize treatment of smoldering infection, prophylaxis of true latency and avoiding unnecessary toxicity for eradicated infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Timing of Immune Responses and Granuloma Formation</title><p>Following the establishment of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the airways and lung parenchyma, the bacilli are believed to be phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages<xref rid="b15-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and are taken up by neutrophils<xref rid="b16-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and dendritic cells (DCs).<xref rid="b17-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Over time, cells progressively assemble in a compact, organized aggregate of mature macrophages surrounded by fibroblasts and interspersed with neutrophils, DCs, Natural Killer cells, B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Selective targeting of TB-specific CD4+ T-cells, functional derangement of CD4+ T cells with skewing of polyfunctionality (IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-2 production) or skewing of cytokine production patterns have been advocated.<xref rid="b72-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="b73-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="b74-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b77-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> No precise CD4-associated mechanism has been so far pinpointed, however, to explain how CD4+ T cells accomplish control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in some patients but fail in others.

The ability to modulate gene expression and to shift antigenic expression during overt replication and latency may represent one of the mechanisms of evasion from the control by the host immune responses. The expression of different gene products during specific and different phases of the disease course may represent a mechanism for mycobacterial evasion from CD4- and CD8-specific T cell responses. For example, ESAT-6 and Ag85B represent major antigenic targets for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and are actively expressed during overt infection. However, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> downregulates their expression as soon as specific CD4+ T cells appear in the mouse model, thus favoring the persistence of the pathogen.<xref rid="b82-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="b83-mjhid-6-1-e2014027" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></p><p>Altogether the increased frequency of TB reactivation in CD4 depleted patients (e.g. HIV--blocking treatments provide evidence that these represent two major elements contributing to persistent and successful control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication and should be regarded as a correlate of efficient pathogen control.
