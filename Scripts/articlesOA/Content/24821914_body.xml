<sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the 1990s, whole genome expression mRNA microarray technology has been available as a tool to researchers. It involves profiling the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and is increasingly being used to advance our understanding of the complex transcriptional response that occurs as a consequence of a disease process [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20130427C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Modern microarray platforms are capable of reliably and reproducibly measuring the expression of over 40 000 mRNA transcripts, which can encompass all of the known functional human genome. By comparing between cohorts of individuals, or by sequentially sampling over a time course, it is possible to delineate a comparative transcriptional response to a given perturbation. Depending on the scale of the response, many hundreds or thousands of significantly differentially regulated genes may be identified. To comprehend the biological relevance of these complex data, bioinformatics tools have been developed that use known relationships between genes and their biological functions. With these tools, it is possible to determine the most biologically significant groups of differentially regulated genes as well as key transcriptional regulatory pathways/networks perturbed upon a given stimulus/disease [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20130427C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Gene expression profiling using peripheral blood</title><p>The early gene expression studies involving human peripheral blood focused on cancer and autoimmune conditions [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The use of peripheral blood for whole genome expression studies in disease has a number of advantages. Peripheral blood is easily accessible, whereas the site of primary infection in certain diseases may not be easy to access, and it is possible to obtain reproducible blood transcriptional profiles from volumes as small as that obtained from a finger prick [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20130427C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Blood represents a reservoir where there is a dynamic exchange of chemokines, cytokines and cells trafficking to and from sites of active disease and the lymphatic system. These cells include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, T cells and B cells; however, the cellular composition of the blood can vary depending on the ethnic background [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] of the patient as well as the scale and specificity of the host response to a disease. Different immune cells may have different baseline levels of gene expression as well as different transcriptional amplification programmes [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The interpretation of blood-derived transcriptional signatures therefore has to be made in the context of the cellular composition of the blood being sampled. Analysis of a subset of cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been used as an attempt to control for this variable, although this excludes from analysis granulocytes such as neutrophils, which make up the greatest proportion of the immune cells found within blood and are important innate immune system effector cells. Furthermore, neutrophils have been seen to be important drivers of the blood transcriptional signature in certain diseases [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The superiority or suitability of PBMCs or whole blood leucocytes (globin RNA reduced) for transcriptional signatures in disease has yet to be rigorously compared. In addition, expression analysis of the subsets of blood leucocytes has also been an informative approach [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20130427C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In some cases, this approach may be necessary to reveal signatures expressed in a discrete cell population that is present only in low numbers in the peripheral blood [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or where the sensitivity of specific gene expression profiles may be masked if a unique profile is present in the cells found in low frequency in human blood [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An alternative approach is to apply computational deconvolution methods; this generates data for both the heterogeneous sample (whole blood, PBMCs) and its specific cell subsets [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>During inflammatory, autoimmune diseases, cancers or infectious diseases the changes observed in a transcriptional blood signature can represent changes in cell numbers, which may be reduced as a consequence of apoptosis or migration of cells from the blood to other tissues. Conversely, increased cell numbers may result from proliferation of cells or migration of cells from the tissues or bone marrow into the blood. Alternatively, the transcriptional changes may be due to discrete changes in transcription within a specific cellular population as a consequence of perturbations resulting from the disease state. As an example, early in the host response to a pathogen, pattern recognition receptors, which are expressed on a wide variety of cell types including cells of the innate immune system, recognize the highly conserved microbial products of pathogens [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Binding of these receptors results in activation of signalling pathways and via transcriptional regulators the induction of transcriptional programmes [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Different pattern recognition receptors can recognize different microbial products and activate specific transcriptional programmes, enabling a transcriptional response appropriate to the pathogen. These directly activated immune cells can traffic from the site of infection and enter the blood stream either directly or via the lymphatic system. Overall, therefore, the transcriptional signatures observed in the blood in response to a disease may be as a consequence of changes in absolute cell numbers, changes in the proportions of cell types as well as changes in transcription within cell populations.</p><p>The specificity of a transcriptional signature for a particular disease may lie in the combination of activated pathways and transcription programmes rather than in uniquely activated disease-specific genes. Tools have been designed to characterize this transcriptional response, such as gene set enrichment analysis, transcriptional networks and modular approaches that can identify combinations of transcriptional programmes associated with diseases [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Algorithmic approaches such as the molecular distance to health or variations on this principle have used gene expression data to assess severity of disease or quantify disease response to treatment [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3"><label>3.</label><title>Infectious diseases</title><p>Gene expression studies in infectious diseases have been used to identify transcriptional signatures that differentiate between bacterial and viral infections [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], bacterial meningitis [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], acute febrile [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and viral illnesses [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as well as specific disease pathogens such as <italic>Burkholderia</italic>

The traditional approach involves identification of the pathogen itself either by direct visualization, culture, nucleic acid amplification of pathogen-specific DNA or by measuring a specific antibody-mediated response. These approaches are not feasible for all infectious diseases, owing to either the inaccessibility of the tissue or difficulty in culturing the pathogen, or because the generation of an antibody-specific response is too slow to guide initial therapy. An ability to identify a transcriptional signature specific for an infectious disease based on the early host response would, therefore, be advantageous for use in diagnosis as well as revealing information about the early host response. Studies have shown that host blood transcriptional signatures can differentiate between different infectious diseases [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

In HIV, pathways involved in apoptosis, development, cell cycle and DNA damage were found to be differentially regulated in patients with rapid disease progression compared with those with slow disease progression [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In dengue infection, transcriptional signatures have enabled identification of differences in children with dengue virus fever from those who developed the more serious dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Transcriptional differences could be seen in patients who subsequently developed DHF, prior to the development of the clinical features, including reduced expression of interferon response genes and differences in complement expression [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These studies have enabled the generation of hypotheses for further experiments to investigate the previously poorly understood aetiology of DHF, and in addition have identified potential early prognostic biomarkers [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Blood-derived gene expression signatures have also been seen to correlate with effective vaccination as measured by the quantity of neutralizing antibodies in yellow fever, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These studies have not only identified putative biomarkers for predicting successful vaccination, but also enabled the description of the temporal kinetics of the transcriptional response to vaccination. Furthermore, they have identified the difference in transcriptional response between the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. The influenza vaccine induced a greater anti-viral response as seen by the induction of interferon genes, compared with the pneumococcal vaccine, which induced more of an inflammatory response [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Transcriptional signatures and systems biology approaches in infectious diseases can therefore feed into many different aspects of research, including translational clinical studies as well as basic immunological work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20130427F1">figure 1</xref>).

Approximately 10% of the latently infected individuals in the Berry <italic>et al.</italic> study [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] had a signature of active tuberculosis. It is unclear, at the present time, whether these individuals represent subclinical disease, incipient conversion from latent to active disease or another process. Further work is required to identify transcriptional signatures of latent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection that can predict those at risk of progression, and this will require longitudinal follow-up.

[<xref rid="RSTB20130427C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] found that after integration of the data from these separate studies interferon signalling was no longer a dominant pathway as had been described in many of the studies when the data had been analysed in isolation. Instead, there was enrichment for genes associated with myeloid cell inflammation, and TREM1 signalling was now found to be the most significant pathway [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>To develop a diagnostic test based on gene expression levels, a transcriptional signature that can distinguish between active tuberculosis and other diseases is needed. An 86 transcript signature was able to differentiate between pulmonary tuberculosis and selected other diseases [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Using a modular approach, it was possible to identify distinct modular patterns for the different inflammatory diseases (group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, adult and paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus and Still's disease) and that tuberculosis had over-representation of interferon, inflammatory and myeloid lineage modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20130427F2">figure 2</xref><italic>b</italic>) [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, further studies comparing tuberculosis with sarcoidosis as well as melioidosis revealed an overlap with the interferon-dominated pulmonary tuberculosis transcriptional signature [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. These signatures have shown that diseases with similar pathophysiology may share similar transcriptional profiles&#x02014;sarcoidosis, melioidosis and tuberculosis are all granulomatous diseases that can affect the lungs. However, when studies were designed that directly compared sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, blood transcriptional signatures could differentiate sarcoidosis from tuberculosis, and revealed an increased interferon-inducible response in tuberculosis in terms of the number of genes upregulated as well as in the magnitude of the response. Conversely, increased eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signalling was detected in patients with sarcoidosis [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One study revealed increased metabolic activity and antimicrobial defence response in tuberculosis when compared with sarcoidosis [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These studies demonstrate not only that diseases with similar pathological findings affecting the same organ can be distinguished using blood transcriptional signatures, but also that we can gain novel immunological insights from these blood transcriptional studies.</p><p>The specificity of any future diagnostic test based on transcriptional signatures will depend on its ability to accurately discriminate tuberculosis from a large number of different diseases. Importantly, it will be necessary to distinguish patients who are co-infected with HIV or not, as well as with comorbidities such as diabetes. Bloom <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] set out to derive transcriptional signatures that could differentiate between active tuberculosis and other diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20130427F2">figure 2</xref><italic>c</italic>). They included diseases that could clinically mimic tuberculosis, and by use of a modular approach to characterize the different diseases they again revealed the strong interferon response found in patients with active sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, but, in contrast, revealed an inflammatory nature of the blood transcriptome of patients with lung cancer or pneumonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20130427F2">figure 2</xref><italic>d</italic>) [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies had excluded HIV-infected participants in order to first define tuberculosis in the absence of any co-infection or co-morbidities. Additionally, there was concern that the reduced CD4+ T cells, as well an HIV transcriptional signature itself, would confound any potential analysis. More recently, Kaforou <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] have published a large case&#x02013;control study involving both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals. This study, by prospectively recruiting patients presenting with symptoms of TB who on further investigation were diagnosed with another disease, generated a large clinically relevant and diverse &#x02018;other diseases&#x02019; cohort to act as a comparison group. In both their own datasets and an independent validation dataset, the derived transcriptional signatures were able to differentiate with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity between tuberculosis and healthy controls as well as tuberculosis and other diseases in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A transcriptional signature for use as a diagnostic will need to be able to diagnose TB from these real-world alternative diagnoses, and in addition the derivation of a signature that can distinguish patients in the context of HIV co-infection is of great importance as in several parts of the world a large number of tuberculosis cases are co-infected with HIV. This study is the first one to identify a transcriptional signature that is able to differentiate those that are <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected from those non-infected despite HIV co-infection.</p><p>A transcriptional signature that reflects response to effective treatment has implications for the development of a clinical test that can determine a successful treatment response. Currently, sputum smear and culture testing after two months of therapy is the best predictor of relapse following treatment completion, but this is limited as sputum is not always accessible. A test that could identify treatment failure or success earlier would have implications for trials of novel drugs and regimens as well as aiding clinical practice by assisting in the identification of drug resistance or non-compliance earlier than is currently possible. Berry <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] first demonstrated that significant transcriptional changes could be detected after two months following initiation of successful therapy. Two recently published studies following patients recruited from South Africa longitudinally showed that a transcriptional signature of active pulmonary tuberculosis quickly diminished with successful treatment [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Transcripts (1261) were seen to significantly fall in expression by one week. Among them were complement genes (C1q, C2 and derpin G1), which the authors hypothesized was related to the rapid reduction in mycobacterial load that was driving complement production [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A separate longitudinal study derived a 664 transcript signature that significantly changed over the course of treatment as well as by two weeks&#x02014;this 664 transcript list was enriched for genes involved in interferon signalling [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s6"><label>6.</label><title>Future</title><p>Gene expression microarray studies have advanced the immunological knowledge of the host response to infectious diseases, opening up avenues for further research as well as identification of potential biomarkers for use in diagnostic and prognostic tests as well as evaluations of response to treatment or vaccination.</p><p>RNA-Seq (also referred to as whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing) is an exciting developing new technology [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] that is starting to become available as a diagnostic approach to infectious and other diseases. RNA-Seq is a tag-based, high-throughput approach in which sequences are mapped against a reference genome thereby eliminating background signals and the need for statistical normalization. The technology has an advantage over microarray in that it additionally allows the detection of novel transcripts rather than reliance on known probe-based sequences. To date, the use of RNA-Seq for diagnosis in tuberculosis has been mostly restricted to looking at small sample numbers (in bovine tuberculosis [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]), and to the best of our knowledge, no reports are available for human tuberculosis. Currently, the cost, challenges of statistical data analysis and the logistics of large data storage currently make microarray a more practical option for analysis approaches that involve large samples/patient numbers. However, ongoing developments in next-generation sequencing, such as the recent United States Food and Drug Administration approval of the Illumina MiSeqD system for clinical use [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], make this a very exciting area for the future diagnosis of human disease.</p><p>Integration of the data from the complex host transcriptional signatures, host clinical phenotypes as well as pathogen genotype/gene expression using systems biology tools that continue to be developed and refined will enable researchers to better synthesize and understand the large volume of complex data being generated. This integrated analysis together with work in experimental models will provide a better understanding of the immunological response to infectious disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20130427F1">figure 1</xref>). Gene expression data benefit from being widely available as an open resource for researchers. Many studies have already taken advantage of publicly available datasets to reanalyse data and integrate it to advance immunological knowledge [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] as well as to test or derive transcriptional signatures [<xref rid="RSTB20130427C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20130427C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The identification of specific transcriptional responses for a disease will further our understanding of the host immune response and also aid in the development of specific tests that can be used in clinical practice. Further studies need to be undertaken to broaden the number of infectious diseases profiled, including co-infection studies, so that the transcriptional signatures may be better defined and be more applicable to &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; situations. Furthermore, these transcriptional signatures will then need to be tested in large-scale prospective clinical trials to assess their ability to perform in large diverse populations. The ultimate use of transcriptionally derived signatures in the clinical management of infectious disease may not be as a standalone diagnostic, but rather used to support and aid in clinical diagnosis/management alongside other tools. For example, in active tuberculosis, a blood signature could support the current smear test, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> culture, clinical symptoms and imaging such as chest radiographs or cross-sectional imaging. For treatment response, it could be used alongside monitoring of clearance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from the sputum.</p></sec>
