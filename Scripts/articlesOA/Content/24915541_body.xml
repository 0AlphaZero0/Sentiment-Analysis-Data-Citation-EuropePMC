Such observations suggest that the immune mechanisms, including DC activation, induced by <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> are different from those induced by <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>. The combined use of functional tests of maturation and the measurement of activation marker membrane expression revealed that the responses of moDCs to <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> were similar to those induced by LPS, corresponding to DC maturation. It has also been reported that <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> activates moDCs and drives the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells <xref rid="pone.0099420-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099420-Paris1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Our results demonstrate that the use of whole functional tests, including the loss of endocytic activity and T-cell proliferation, were not sufficiently accurate to discriminate among the responses of DCs to bacteria. These assays might also lead to erroneous conclusions, as <italic>O. tsutsugamushi, C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> share the ability to induce the loss of endocytosis and T-cell proliferation. The discrepancy between the expression of membrane antigens and functional tests of maturation has been described in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. Indeed, the subsets of DCs that are infected at high frequency poorly stimulate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, despite the expression of surface MHC class II molecules and costimulatory molecules <xref rid="pone.0099420-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0099420-Tantibhedhyangkul2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> rules out wall LPS as stimulating <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>-induced full DC maturation, which is emphasized by the failure of LPS-expressing <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> to fully induce the maturation of DCs.

We found that <italic>B. abortus</italic> LPS induced an moDC phenotype similar to that induced by the entire bacterium, as only CD80 and CD86 were expressed at the moDC membrane (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099420.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), suggesting that <italic>B. abortus</italic> LPS is unable to fully activate moDCs. Indeed, <italic>B. abortus</italic> LPS might act along with the btp1 protein <xref rid="pone.0099420-Salcedo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> to prevent the proper DC-driven immune response. Here, we confirm that the LPSs from <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> are not sufficient to activate moDC responses.</p><p>We focused on the moDC responses induced by <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic>. The activation of the MAPK p38 was defective in response to <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic>. The defective activation of p38 by <italic>C. burnetii</italic> has been reported in macrophages and related to the escape of bacteria to degradative compartments <xref rid="pone.0099420-Barry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The modulation of p38 by <italic>Brucella</italic> sp. is debated. The LPS O chain from <italic>Brucella</italic> sp. restricts the activation of p38 <xref rid="pone.0099420-JimenezdeBaquies1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and the intracellular replication of <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> is mainly dependent of p38 <xref rid="pone.0099420-Demitrakopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>B. abortus</italic> activates p38 in murine astrocytes <xref rid="pone.0099420-Miraglia1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The transcriptional signature induced by <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> compared to that induced by <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> and LPS was composed of a series of down-modulated genes. The comparison of the KEGG &#x0201c;Influenza&#x0201d; response pathway led to the identification of nodes targeted by <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> to down-modulate <italic>TLR4</italic>/<italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic> and type I IFN-responsive genes. We recently explored the transcriptional datasets that are deposited in public repertories, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus, and we focused the main transductional pathways that lead to the type I IFN response during bacterial infections. We found that the type I IFN pattern induced by vacuolar bacteria is completely different from the signatures induced by viruses and cytosolic bacteria <xref rid="pone.0099420-Textoris1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The IFN response pathway has been described in transcriptomics analysis of tuberculosis in which it remains silent in latent tuberculosis and was fully active in patients with active tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0099420-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> share the ability to cause a chronic evolution of disease and bacterial persistence, such a strategy may be operative for their persistence. <italic>C. burnetii</italic> was unable to stimulate the release of IFN-&#x003b2;, and <italic>B. abortus</italic> only induced the release of low levels of IFN-&#x003b2; compared to <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>. It has been recently demonstrated that <italic>B. abortus</italic> induced the production of IFN-&#x003b2; by moDCs in mice <xref rid="pone.0099420-deAlmeida1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The recognition of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> by cytosolic sensors and the activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0099420-Boldrick1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> may be related to the ability of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> to escape phagosomes and enter the cytosol <xref rid="pone.0099420-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, as found for <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0099420-BarHaim1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0099420-Edelson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099420-Tam1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b2; was also reported to be produced by monocytes and macrophages in response to <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0099420-Tantibhedhyangkul1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099420-Tantibhedhyangkul2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting that the intracellular lifestyle of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> is critical for the production of type I IFN.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that intracellular bacteria, such as <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic>, are able to modulate the maturation of moDCs. The classical functional tests of DC maturation are not sufficiently accurate to detect impaired DC responses. However, using a systems biology approach, we found that <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> dampen the type I IFN response. This effect may lead to inefficient immune response and bacterial persistence within the host, conferring a critical role for the type I IFN pathway in antibacterial immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0099420.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
