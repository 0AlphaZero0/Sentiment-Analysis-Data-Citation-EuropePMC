<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tuberculosis (TB) epidemic in many parts of the world has been greatly exacerbated in recent years, not only by the HIV co-epidemic, but also by the rise in multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb). MDR-TB is defined by resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH), the two most effective drugs against TB and the backbone of standard short-course therapy <xref rid="pone.0102178-Nunn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102178-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The quest for new pharmaceuticals to combat both drug susceptible and resistant TB and expand treatment options for patients with MDR-TB is a major challenge. At present, the success of TB therapy is established by the risk of relapse within the first 2 years after treatment, which necessitates long clinical trials and extended follow-up of patients. Thus, to support clinical trials and improve case management, early predictors of clinical outcome that can serve as interim indicators of treatment response are needed. The only currently accepted interim indicators are sputum culture conversion after 2 months of standard therapy and time to culture positivity at the start of treatment, which provides an indicator of bacillary load <xref rid="pone.0102178-Holtz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102178-Wallis2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, culture-based methods require 6&#x02013;8 weeks for a result and are only appropriate for patients who are sputum culture positive at baseline. To address this clinical need, as well as to shorten the time required for clinical trials of new TB drugs in the pipeline, extensive efforts to discover early biomarkers of response to TB treatment are currently underway <xref rid="pone.0102178-Wallis3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102178-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The evaluation of candidate host immune biomarkers is a particularly active area of research, which additionally can contribute to our general understanding of the pathogenesis of TB disease <xref rid="pone.0102178-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A number of investigators have examined serodiagnostic markers in patients before and during TB treatment, including inflammatory molecules, cytokines and chemokines, as well as antibodies against Mtb proteins <xref rid="pone.0102178-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102178-Baumann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the host blood transcriptome <xref rid="pone.0102178-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102178-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Others have assessed various immune cell populations in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage <xref rid="pone.0102178-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102178-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102178-Schluger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although several groups have described associations between specific markers of T cell activation/function and outcome of TB treatment, there is, as yet, no consensus in the field about the most promising candidates. Importantly, many of the reported studies have used cross-sectional designs to identify candidate biomarkers that can differentiate patients with active disease from individuals who have successfully completed TB treatment or have latent TB infection, rather than following patients prospectively. Moreover, few studies have examined the generalizability of candidate biomarkers for use in monitoring patients during treatment of MDR-TB <xref rid="pone.0102178-Eum1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This is an important question, as rising rates of MDR-TB are increasingly hampering TB control, particularly in regions with high prevalence of TB and HIV <xref rid="pone.0102178-Tudor1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0102178-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, the specific issues associated with conducting randomized controlled trials of drug regimens in MDR-TB patients support the value of investigating interim markers of response to treatment in this population <xref rid="pone.0102178-Lienhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>As part of a prospective cohort study to investigate host factors associated with delayed response to treatment and treatment failure in patients with MDR-TB, we have carried out a pilot study to examine T cell markers in 18 patients. Our goal was to correlate specific T cell subsets in blood with bacillary (antigen) load, as indicated by sputum culture (SC) positivity, and to investigate changes in the relative frequencies and phenotypic characteristics of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cell subsets in patients responding to TB treatment. Our results show that TB patients have highly activated mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cells, which become less activated as patients respond to chemotherapy. Validation of our findings in a larger group of patients, including those with drug susceptible TB, may identify a host cellular phenotype that can provide a useful early marker predictive of time to culture conversion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study participants and sample collection</title><p>Participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18) were recruited at Sizwe Hospital, the central MDR-TB referral hospital in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The study cohort had a median age of 39 years (IQR: 26&#x02013;51 years) and a sex ratio of 13&#x02236;5 male:female. All enrolled patients were HIV negative. TB diagnosis was based on sputum culture; diagnosis of MDR was based on phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST by Bactec MGIT 960, Beckton Dickinson, Baltimore, MD) and/or genotypic resistance by PCR (Line Probe Assay, Hain Lifesciences). All study participants were diagnosed with culture positive MDR-TB based on sputum specimens obtained at a median of 57 days (IQR: 33&#x02013;99 days) prior to admission to Sizwe Hospital (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102178.s005">Table S1</xref>). As part of the admission process, routine chest X-ray (CXR) was performed. CXR films were reviewed by physicians (who were not study investigators) and scored for cavitation (no, single or multiple cavities; &#x0003c;2, 2&#x02013;4 or &#x0003e;4 cm diameter) and extent of disease (0, &#x0003c;50% or &#x02265;50% of area affected) in six zones, defined by the mediastinum and horizontal lines through the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> anterior rib shadows <xref rid="pone.0102178-Health1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Thirteen patients were receiving short-course TB chemotherapy (with or without streptomycin) at the time of admission; two (#9 and #12) had been diagnosed with primary MDR-TB after initiating short-course therapy for drug susceptible TB and 11 were admitted after failing short-course therapy. Three patients had been admitted with primary MDR-TB and were TB treatment na&#x000ef;ve (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102178-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The activated sub-population of cells in the blood, whether Mtb- or PPD-specific, appeared to mirror antigen load in the lungs, and the baseline frequency significantly associated with the time taken to achieve culture conversion. This was further supported by the finding that the lowest frequencies of activated and proliferating mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells were found in six of the eighteen patients who were SC negative upon enrollment. Although MDR-TB was detectable in these participants, they were most likely responsive to standard chemotherapy, and this was reflected in the lowest detectable frequency of mycobacteria-specific proliferating CD4 T cells in these patients. These data also suggest that our findings may also be applicable to patients with drug susceptible TB.</p><p>This study highlights four main findings, each of which underlines the immune response to TB, but can also be applied to assess sputum culture status or to monitor the efficacy of TB treatment. The first finding was that the degree of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cell memory differentiation is associated with bacillary load, as indicated by SC positivity, and is in agreement with the results of studies of patients with drug susceptible TB. These reports describe higher LD mycobacterial-specific CD4 T cells relative to ED cells in TB patients who were smear or culture positive prior to treatment and a shift to relatively higher proportions of ED CD4 T with treatment or in individuals with cured TB <xref rid="pone.0102178-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102178-Petruccioli1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, patients with persistently active TB disease who remained SC positive after 6 months of treatment were shown to have low frequencies of antigen-specific CD27<sup>+</sup>CD4 T cells <xref rid="pone.0102178-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Collectively, these results suggest that chronically high levels of mycobacterial antigens in active TB lead to the accumulation of LD memory cells.</p><p>Our second finding was a larger proportion of proliferating (as measured by Ki-67) and activated (as measured by HLA-DR) Mtb and PPD-specific CD4 T cells in patients who were SC positive compared to SC negative patients. Up-regulation of the nuclear protein, Ki-67, occurs when cells leave the G0 (resting) phase and enter into the G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0102178-Gerdes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The increased expression of Ki-67, along with HLA-DR co-expression, supports the presence of systemically activated T cells in patients with SC positive TB and likely elevated bacillary load. Our results appear to be in contrast with a study by Day et al, showing higher proportions of activated proliferating CD4 T cells in individuals with latent TB infection and in patients following TB treatment compared to those with active TB disease <xref rid="pone.0102178-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, in this study, proliferative capacity was evaluated in Oregon Green stained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) following 6 days of antigen stimulation. In contrast, our results were obtained from whole blood that was stimulated for 12 hours and stained for the nuclear marker Ki-67, which we consider to be more representative of the in vivo condition. In particular, it may be expected that over 6 days, some CD4+ T cell populations may die in the assay and those that respond and proliferate will likely be central memory cells. We speculate that persistently high levels of TB antigens are enough to drive activation of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells to proliferation and propose that these cells reflect antigen load in the host and therefore represent potentially useful biomarkers of the extent of Mtb infection.</p><p>The third finding of this study was that polyfunctional mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells increased over time of TB treatment. This is consistent with other reports from studies of patients with drug susceptible TB <xref rid="pone.0102178-Harari1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In particular, the decline in IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>TNF&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells coincident with an increased population of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>+</sup>TNF&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells is in agreement with Day et al <xref rid="pone.0102178-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, who investigated changes in relation to bacillary load, as defined by sputum smear acid-fast bacilli (AFB), during treatment. These results may indicate that higher mycobacterial load is associated with impaired IL2 production, which recovers with treatment and bacillary clearance <xref rid="pone.0102178-Foo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This hypothesis is supported by several cross-sectional studies showing a higher proportion of mycobacteria-specific IFN<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup> or IFNg<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4 T cells or lower IL2<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells in patients with active TB than in patients after successful treatment <xref rid="pone.0102178-Petruccioli1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102178-Sester1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102178-Millington1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The discordance of our data with one study showing that polyfunctionality diminished upon TB treatment <xref rid="pone.0102178-Caccamo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> may be explained by differences in the assay conditions, such as the use of PBMCs instead of whole blood, varying sources of serum, and different antigens used in ex vivo stimulations <xref rid="pone.0102178-Veenstra1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We also found that the increased polyfunctionality of CD4 T cells was not necessarily linked with the emergence of ED CD4 T cells, as polyfunctional CD4 T cells increased in both ED and LD populations with response to treatment. Moreover, PPD-specific LD cells were more polyfunctional after 6 months of chemotherapy than ED cells, suggesting that memory differentiation and the ability to express multiple cytokines were not associated. While the increased polyfunctional CD4 T cell population, seen as a protective phenotype in multiple experimental studies <xref rid="pone.0102178-Beveridge1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102178-Derrick1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, may indicate improved immunity, as suggested by Harari et al <xref rid="pone.0102178-Harari1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, this may merely reflect a homeostatic response to lowered mycobacterial antigen load.</p><p>Our fourth finding was the reduced frequency of activated proliferating mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells with bacillary clearance and that baseline activation was predictive of time to culture conversion. We hypothesize that, as bacterial burden is cleared with antibiotic treatment, there is less antigenic stimulation and immunity shifts to a more responsive state. This is consistent with the observed increase in polyfunctionality and was reflected in a trend toward an increased proportion of ED cells over time of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102178.s004">Figure S4</xref>). A similar association between antigen load and T cell subsets has been described in the context of HIV viral load during early infection <xref rid="pone.0102178-Riou2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and in response to anti-retroviral treatment <xref rid="pone.0102178-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. To test this hypothesis, a validation cohort would need to be analyzed.</p><p>It is important to note that the present study is a pilot involving a small number of patients, which requires validation through a larger cohort study. While the specific analytic approach used in this study is not practical for wider application, identification of a subset of cells that provides a robust predictor of response to TB treatment can form a foundation for developing a simpler assay. Nonetheless, the association between mycobacteria-specific T cell activation and SC positivity and response to treatment is robust, and, if confirmed, could be highly useful in advancing our understanding of T cell biomarkers in TB treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0102178.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
