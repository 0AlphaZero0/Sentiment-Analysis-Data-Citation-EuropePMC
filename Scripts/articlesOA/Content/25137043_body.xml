<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gram-negative bacterium <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, the causative agent of whooping cough (pertussis), accounted for high mortality rates among infants in the pre-vaccine era. Whole cell and acellular vaccines have drastically decreased the number of cases <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mattoo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, recently resurgence of pertussis in the vaccinated population has been observed in the USA <xref rid="pone.0104548-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Baxter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and in European countries <xref rid="pone.0104548-Celentano1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kretzschmar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Currently pertussis is still endemic, ranking in the top-ten of vaccine preventable diseases worldwide, according to the WHO. Next to improved diagnostics and public awareness, also strain adaptation and waning immunity are thought to be responsible for this increase in disease cases <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mooi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, a call for vaccines with improved efficacy is evident.</p><p>As a main feature of the innate immune response upon <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in mice the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4 has been acknowledged <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This activation of TLR4 by <italic>B. pertussis</italic> leads to up-regulation of cytokine gene expression and recruitment of neutrophils into the lungs <xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It was found in animal models that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection results in formation of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Since immunity induced by natural infections provides faster clearance upon reinfection and is longer lasting compared to both acellular and whole cell pertussis vaccination <xref rid="pone.0104548-Wendelboe1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, immune mechanisms induced upon infection or vaccination have been compared. In human and murine studies, immunization with whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines results predominantly in a Th1 or a Th2 response, respectively <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ausiello1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, in both the intramuscular (human) or subcutaneous (mice) administered acellular and whole cell pertussis vaccines, the humoral response is characterized by systemic IgG <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mills2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Canthaboo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, while mucosal immune responses seem absent. Despite the absence of direct evidence for correlates of protection against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, both Th1 and Th17 type CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells as well as IgA-producing B-cells seem to play an important role in a protective immune response against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>

Since these responses are not induced by the currently available vaccines <xref rid="pone.0104548-Hendrikx1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but more resemble responses induced by infection, a better understanding of the immune response induced in the host following <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection is needed. Despite knowledge on particular elements of the immune response generated by a <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection, little is known about the kinetics and sequential relation of these elements. For this, systems biology can be an important tool, as was shown for tuberculosis and influenza infection <xref rid="pone.0104548-Brandes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Here, systems biology was applied to elucidate molecular and cellular events in the different phases of the immune response after primary <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in a murine model. To this end, innate and adaptive immune responses were investigated over a period of 66 days post infection. Gene expression profiles in spleen and lungs, cytokine profiles in sera, and cellular composition of the spleen were determined at twelve time points. Furthermore, cellular and antibody mediated immune responses against <italic>B. pertussis</italic> were investigated.

Highlights of the study are given, based on lung clearance, relative gene expression levels (lungs), cytokine profiles (serum), cellular response (spleen) and pertussis-specific responses in serum and spleen as depicted in the figure legend.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104548.g013"/></fig><p>Highlights featured in this study are: (i) a protracted acute phase response, as part of the innate phase, lasting for at least 28 days, which co-occurred with prolonged antigen exposure; (ii) the recognition of several <italic>B. pertussis</italic> &#x02018;PAMPs&#x02019; (pathogen associated molecular pattern), i.e. LPS, DNA and GalNac, (iii) early signatures for recruitment of adaptive immune cells e.g. the cytokine CCL20 that attracts CCR6<sup>+</sup>Th17 cells, (iv) expression of specific membrane markers (e.g. DAP12) and transcription factors that determine the strength and direction of the adaptive immune response. Furthermore, features of adaptive immunity consisted of: (v) IgA secretion in the lungs; (vi) a broad systemic antibody response; (vii) a Th1 and Th17-mediated response in the lungs and (viii) systemic formation of specific memory Th1 and Th17 cells.</p><p>Various signatures, associated with the induced protective immune response as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g013">Figure 13</xref>, are discussed in detail hereafter. The innate phase was characterized by the presence of AMPs, acute phase proteins and chemotactic cytokines as detected by microarray analysis and MIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g007">7</xref>). Expression of the involved genes is most likely initiated by activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by LPS of <italic>B. pertussis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Up-regulated gene expression of four AMPs (<italic>Chi3l1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl17</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic>, <italic>Spli</italic>) was found in the lungs during the whole course of infection. These AMPs contribute to innate protection as was shown for other respiratory pathogens <xref rid="pone.0104548-Nishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-DelaCruz1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Burkhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, these AMPs have the capacity to recruit immune cells, such as neutrophils, DCs, and monocytes <xref rid="pone.0104548-Schroll1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Pisabarro1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and are therefore important for the induction of subsequent immune responses <xref rid="pone.0104548-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the expression of particular cytokines on gene and protein level in the innate phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g007">7</xref>), in combination with increased gene expression of cytokine receptors and the change in cellular composition of the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g008">8A</xref>), gave detailed insight into the immunological processes during the course of infection, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g013">Figure 13</xref>. For example, the gene expression levels of the cytokines <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, <italic>Cxcl5</italic> and <italic>Cxcl17</italic> was in agreement with the recruitment of neutrophils and DCs towards the site of infection <xref rid="pone.0104548-Pisabarro1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Jeyaseelan1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Bozic1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Furthermore, the gene expression of the cytokines <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Cxcl11</italic> and <italic>Ccl20</italic> was increased early after infection. CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are known to be involved in the recruitment of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, and CCL20 in the recruitment of CCR6<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells <xref rid="pone.0104548-Alcaide1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-ClarkLewis1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. The up-regulation of <italic>Ccr6</italic> and <italic>Cxcr3</italic> genes was observed at day 14 p.i. in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g013">Figure 13</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, gene expression of cytokines, acute phase proteins and AMPs was temporary suppressed at 2 days p.i. Simultaneously, the proliferation of bacteria started in the lungs. These results indicate temporary suppression of the immune system by <italic>B. pertussis</italic>. Several immune evasion strategies of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> have been described in literature <xref rid="pone.0104548-Boyd1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-McGuirk1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. The evasion is attributed to virulence factors, such as adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), pertussis toxin (Ptx), tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA). These investigators demonstrated enhanced production of IL-10 and regulatory T-cells, delay of neutrophil recruitment, and inhibition of early chemokine production in mice in relation to secretion of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> virulence factors. In the present study, these immunosuppressive properties of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> might explain the suppression of the differential gene expression observed 2 days p.i. In addition, secretion of OMVs occurs during bacterial colonization <xref rid="pone.0104548-Hozbor1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. These OMVs are thought to serve as decoy for the host immune response and their immunomodulatory properties support survival of the bacteria <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kuehn1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>.</p><p>During the bridging phase, the number of bacteria in the lungs increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The highest number of bacteria in the lungs was found at 7 days p.i. followed by a decrease, suggesting that day 7 is the turning point in the progress of the infection. Simultaneously, microarray analysis suggests the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, and DCs in the lungs based on BioGPS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104548.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These cells are likely responsible for (i) phagocytosis, (ii) pathogen recognition, (iii) antigen presentation and (iv) differentiation by expression of cell receptors in the period between 4&#x02013;10 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g013">Figure 13</xref>).</p><p>The innate immune cells appeared to cause the initial decrease in numbers of bacteria in the lungs from 7 days p.i., because a strong antibody response (IgM, IgG, IgA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g011">Figure 11</xref>) and CD4<sup>+</sup> cell response were not yet present. Based on gene expression of neutrophil markers, the neutrophil invasion in the lungs probably occurred from 4 days p.i., which is observed on cellular level by McGuirk <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104548-McGuirk2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. This influx of cells is most likely orchestrated by IL-17A and G-CSF <xref rid="pone.0104548-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. In the present study, both cytokines were enhanced in the sera of infected mice. Furthermore, genes involved in phagocytosis were found to be up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g006">Figure 6</xref>) which is important for protection against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104548-Zurita1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>.</p><p>This study demonstrated also that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection activates different pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways, such as TLR4, TLR9, DAI and several CLRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Bacterial ligands, e.g. LPS, DNA and GalNAc trigger these signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Takaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Vukman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Up-regulation of genes involved in TLR4-signalling (<italic>Md-1</italic>, <italic>Irf5</italic>) is probably caused by detection of bacterial LPS <xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Bacterial DNA recognition occurred through the TLR9 pathway (<italic>Ctsk, Irf7</italic>) and the cytosolic DNA sensor (<italic>Dai</italic>). The receptor DAI recognizes both host DNA, upon tissue damage, and bacterial DNA, which leads to an innate immune response <xref rid="pone.0104548-Takaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Furthermore, increased gene expression of the CLRs, <italic>Signr7</italic>, <italic>Signr8</italic> and <italic>Mgl1</italic> was observed, which are predominantly expressed on DCs <xref rid="pone.0104548-vanKooyk1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-denDunnen1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. The enhanced expression of mouse DC-SIGN-related genes <italic>Signr7</italic> and <italic>Signr8</italic> during the <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection is a novel finding. Despite indications of sensing of 6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide by Signr7, the exact ligands and role of these receptors remains to be discovered <xref rid="pone.0104548-Powlesland1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Recognition of GalNAc via Mgl1 has recently been associated with mast cell activation by <italic>B. pertussis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104548-Vukman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. An important conclusion is that ligands of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> activate multiple pathogen recognition pathways during the infection. This may be important for the induction of a broad adaptive immune response, including Th1 as well as Th17 cells, mucosal IgA and systemic IgG.</p><p>During the bridging phase, up-regulation of MHC class I and II genes were measured, enabling antigen presentation to both CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-cells and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (CTLs). Several studies focused on the role of Th-cells because of their important contribution to protect against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104548-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Leef1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Nevertheless, the CTLs seem also important for protection against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, indicated by CTL infiltration in lungs and formation of FHA-specific IFN&#x000e3;-producing CTLs upon <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection as was previously found in mice and humans <xref rid="pone.0104548-McGuirk2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Dirix1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the bridging phase was characterized by simultaneous gene expression of several receptors on innate immune cells in the lungs and spleen. Interestingly, this included MAIRs, TREMs, semaphorins and DAP12, which is the first evidence that these receptors might play a role in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection. Especially DAP12, which is abundantly expressed in lungs, interacts with other membrane receptors and influences cytokine expression <xref rid="pone.0104548-Aoki1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Coupled to MAIR-II, DAP12 is an inhibitor of B-cell responses <xref rid="pone.0104548-NakanoYokomizo1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Together with TREM2, DAP12 down-regulates TLR and FcR expression <xref rid="pone.0104548-Hamerman1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Overall, these former receptors function as an important bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses, determining the strength and direction of the adaptive immune response by the successive activation of lymphocytes, such as CTLs, Th-cells, and B-cells <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kikutani1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Takagi1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Nimmerjahn1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Since the exact role of these receptors in the protection against <italic>B. pertussis</italic> remains unresolved, additional research is needed to find whether targeting of these receptors might be a viable strategy to elicit desired immune responses. In summary, the bridging phase suggests the presence of APCs and myeloid cells, such as DCs and neutrophils based on gene expression of membrane markers. However, this was not validated by histological data.</p><p>Finally, the adaptive phase was recognized by the formation of T-cell and B-cell responses and a broad humoral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g013">Figure 13</xref>). In this same period, the naive mice were able to clear <italic>B. pertussis</italic> from their lungs. Gene expression, cytokine secretion and cellular analysis revealed presence of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-cells. The highest number of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-cells was detected at 14 days p.i., which is in agreement with a study showing the largest influx of Th17 cells in the lungs after <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection at 14 days p.i. <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Phenotyping of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-cells, based on cytokine profiles in serum (protein) and lung (genes) and expression of specific transcription factors or membrane markers, suggests a broad Th-response in the present study. The Th1 response in the lungs was characterized by <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic> expression <xref rid="pone.0104548-Afkarian1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Gene expression of the mucosal homing receptor <italic>Ccr6</italic>, <italic>Card11</italic>, <italic>Ccl19</italic>, <italic>Ccl21a</italic>, <italic>Ccl21c</italic>, and signature cytokines <italic>Il17a</italic> and <italic>Il17f</italic> might indicate Th17 cells in the lungs <xref rid="pone.0104548-Alcaide1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-AcostaRodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Kuwabara1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. Upon re-stimulation of splenocytes with purified <italic>B. pertussis</italic> antigens, Prn- and FHA-specific Th1 and Th17 type CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells could be detected in the memory phase (66 days p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g012">Figure 12</xref>). In addition, enhanced IL-9 levels in serum suggest activation of Th9 cells and Th17 cells as these cells produce large amounts of IL-9 <xref rid="pone.0104548-Veldhoen1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Nowak1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. However, Tregs, NKT-cells and mast cells are also sources of IL-9. In summary, the different phases of T-cell development were mapped; the expansion phase of naive T-cells in the spleen (2 days p.i.), the effector phase in the lungs (14 days p.i.), contraction phase in the spleen (21 days p.i.) and finally the specific memory T-cells (66 days p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g008">8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g010">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g012">12</xref>). Data from this study suggests generation of local specific Th1/Th17 cells in the lungs. Th1 cells, which produce IFN&#x003b3; are important for clearance of <italic>B. pertussis</italic>. Postponed clearance was shown in IFN&#x000e3;-depleted mice <xref rid="pone.0104548-Barbic1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. Th17 cells have been indicated as key cells to control bacterial infections at mucosal sites <xref rid="pone.0104548-Khader1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. Recent studies revealed that Th17 cells increase the clearance of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> after an intranasal infection in animals <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Fedele1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>.</p><p>Infection with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> induces also B-cell and antibody mediated immunity. Microarray analysis showed increased gene expression of the BCR in the lungs. In addition, gene expression of IgM, IgG and IgA was observed in lungs and spleen. Whereas, most genes for antibody isotypes were found up-regulated in both tissues, IgM was down-regulated in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g010">10</xref>). This was confirmed by the detection of IgA and IgG (IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b) after 14 days p.i. However, IgM antibodies were not found systemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g011">Figure 11</xref>). In mice, IgG1 is associated with a Th2-like response, while IgG2a (in Balb/c mice) and IgG2b suggest induction of a Th1 response <xref rid="pone.0104548-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. IgG2b is also linked to Th17 lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mitsdoerffer1" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>. All antibody responses in the present study were directed against whole cell <italic>B. pertussis</italic> and outer membrane vesicles, but not against the <italic>B. pertussis</italic> antigens that are typically present in acellular vaccines: Ptx, Prn, FHA and Fim2/3. However, memory Th1/Th17 cells were detected upon re-stimulation with Prn and FHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g012">Figure 12</xref>). The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) was highly expressed during the whole course of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in the lungs. pIgR is essential for the transport of IgA into the mucus and is seen as a bridge between innate and adaptive mucosal responses <xref rid="pone.0104548-Norderhaug1" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kaetzel1" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. The expression of pIgR was drastically enhanced 14 days p.i., leading to secretion of mucosal IgA in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g011">11</xref>). Interestingly, the increased pIgR expression coincided with IL-17A production in the lungs and sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g007">7</xref>), which is in agreement with the finding that Th17-mediated responses influence the local humoral response by inducing pIgR expression and elevating secretory IgA levels <xref rid="pone.0104548-Jaffar1" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. Therefore, the transport of IgA to the mucosa, which is orchestrated by IL-17A via the induction of pIgR, supports an important role for local immunity. In summary, <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection induces a broad humoral response, which was observed by gene and protein expression.</p><p>Our study also contains several conceptual points for discussion. First, altered gene expression in the spleen caused by <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection was modest, except for 21 days p.i. Two possible reasons can be given: (i) the infection initiated a local immune response in the lungs and (ii) gene expression is required to be rather strong to exceed the significance threshold. After the lungs and the draining lymph nodes, the spleen is the third organ in line involved in the generation of the immune response. Therefore, gene expression effects could be less abundant. Furthermore, the spleen consists of many cell types with different gene expression profiles, so changes in expression levels in a single cell type might not have been detected. Cell sorting of individual cell types and subsequent gene expression profiling could overcome this problem. Second, specific antibody and T-cell responses were only measured for a limited set of available purified antigens. The inclusion of other antigens, such as outer membrane proteins, would perhaps have allowed a more detailed analysis. Third, in this study we propose murine infection-induced immune signatures as a benchmark to be used in the development of improved human pertussis vaccines. Since <italic>B. pertussis</italic> is not a natural pathogen for mice, translation of the results obtained in this study to the human situation remains to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, using a (naive) murine model has several advantages. It is regarded an important small animal model for pertussis vaccine development <xref rid="pone.0104548-vanderArk1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref> and enables to dissect the local and systemic immune response in great detail, as shown in this study, rather than using blood or nasal washes from humans undergoing a <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection. Furthermore, the role of individual gene signatures and products could be assessed in future research in mice by using knockin or knockout strains, or by functional interventions. Encouraging is that many observations made in this study, such as the rapid clearance upon reinfection and involvement of Th17 and Th1 responses, are in line with recent studies on <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in baboons, which resemble the human situation more closely <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Translation of biomarkers from mouse to man however should be performed with care.</p><p>Overall, our study describes the molecular and cellular sequence of events that eventually lead to the induction of protective immunity to pertussis, including local immunity in the lungs, which is not induced by current vaccines. Especially the inductions of Th1 and Th17 cells and IgA in the lungs are regarded key elements in superior immunity. Our data can be used to select vaccine concepts that resemble infection, with respect to e.g. administration route and prolonged antigen exposure, and immune signatures elicited. Local delivery of vaccines may be an important advancement for improved protection as was previously demonstrated with a live attenuated pertussis vaccine <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mielcarek1" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. Also adjuvants could be selected and optimized that can steer host immunity of inactivated vaccines towards an infection-like immune response with minimal adverse effects. The molecular and cellular fingerprint of the local immune response discovered in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infected mice thus can provide a strong guidance for developing improved pertussis vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The independent ethical committee for animal experimentations &#x02018;Dierexperiment Commissie (DEC)&#x02019; of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) reviewed the animal experiments in this study according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act.

(mean of n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3). An increased percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells (monocytes, DCs and macrophages) was found 1 day p.i., followed by natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages at 2 days p.i. There was a gradual increase in the percentage of neutrophils in the spleen until 7 days p.i. Furthermore, an increased percentage of T-cells, distinguished by the CD3 marker, was found 2 and 4 days p.i. A similar increase was observed for both CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T-cell subsets, indicating that this increase was not specific for either T-helper or cytotoxic T-cells. The CD4<sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly 21 days p.i. and remained constant until at least 28 days p.i. B-cells decreased during two periods: 2&#x02013;4 and 10&#x02013;14 days p.i. Finally, a significant increase in percentage of DCs (33D1<sup>+</sup>) was detected 7 days p.i.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0104548.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104548.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>
