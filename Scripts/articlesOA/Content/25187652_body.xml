Effector functions elicited in these cells upon infection are crucial to the establishment of an adaptive immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, restriction of bacterial growth, and ultimately to host resistance (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Key effectors linked to host protection produced by these cells include the cytokines IL-12, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Production of NO and other molecules that restrict intracellular bacterial growth is also of importance (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). IL-12 is critical for activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to the protective Th1 response and induction of IFN-&#x003b3; from a variety of cellular sources (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; is in turn crucial for the full activation of macrophage bactericidal functions (such as NO production and restriction of mycobacterial growth) and further enhancement of innate cytokine production (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Whereas immune mechanisms that lead to host resistance have been intensively studied, less is understood about potentially damaging or inhibitory immune responses leading to activation or exacerbation of tuberculosis (TB). There is a growing appreciation that the type I IFN family of cytokines plays a detrimental as opposed to protective role during TB, particularly when such cytokines are present in excess amounts, with evidence in both mice and humans largely supporting this hypothesis (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Studies of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of mice that lack the receptor common to all type I IFN (<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice) found reduced bacterial load and/or increased survival compared with wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), pointing to a negative role of type I IFN in TB. However, results have not been unequivocal, with some suggestion that type I IFN may have protective activities under certain conditions (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Studies where excess levels of type I IFN are induced during TB, either through direct instillation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; into the lung (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), administration of a polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid derivative (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), or abrogation of a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) support a detrimental role for type I IFN during TB, as they all resulted in exacerbated disease. In accordance with these results, hypervirulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains reportedly induce high levels of type I IFN (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Recent reports have also revealed a potential role for type I IFN in the human immune response during TB, because cohorts of active TB patients in London and South Africa showed a prominent type I IFN&#x02013;inducible gene signature in their blood, which cell separation experiments found was present predominantly in myeloid cells (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Furthermore, the signature was correlated with the extent of radiographic disease and resolved upon successful treatment (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These findings have now been verified by other groups using patient cohorts from Africa (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and Indonesia (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which type I IFN exacerbates disease during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection are only partially understood. Recently, studies have described a role for type I IFN in suppressing production of the protective cytokine IL-1 in both in vivo mouse models (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and human monocytes (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This inhibition of IL-1 was partially dependent on IL-10 (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which is known to be induced by type I IFN (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). IL-10 is also induced during infection with another intracellular bacteria, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, where type I IFNs are similarly detrimental to the host (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Furthermore, IL-10 is known to inhibit the immune response during TB, particularly the Th1 cell response (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Earlier studies of infection with hypervirulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains that induce high levels of type I IFN also point to a reduction in the protective Th1 response, with reduced IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; during infection (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In human infections with the leprosy agent <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, type I IFN has also been shown to induce IL-10 and restrict IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;mediated antibacterial responses (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Additionally, type I IFNs have been shown to downregulate IFN-&#x003b3; receptor expression on myeloid cells during <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>We have investigated the effects of type I IFN on macrophage function during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We found that type I IFN inhibits production of multiple protective cytokines by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages and induces the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Notably, type I IFN also robustly suppressed macrophage responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b3;, preventing IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent enhancement of cytokine production and inhibiting IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;mediated macrophage bacterial growth inhibition and killing. These results suggest an important role for type I IFN in inhibiting the immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> at the level of the macrophage, potentially impairing both macrophage induction of, and response to, adaptive immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (B6), B6 <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, B6 <italic>Il10</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and B6 <italic>Tccr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (IL-27R &#x003b1;-chain&#x02013;deficient) mice were bred and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, B6 <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (and B6 WT controls) were bred and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (Porto, Portugal), and bones from these mice were shipped overnight on ice to the National Institute for Medical Research.

We found that type I IFN was required for induction of IL-27 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages and that addition of IFN-&#x003b2; enhanced IL-27 production, in agreement with this study and others (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). However, we found no requirement for IL-27 signaling in IL-10 induction or enhancement of IL-10 production by IFN-&#x003b2;. IL-10 production by BM-derived dendritic cells and BM monocytes was also unaffected by IL-27. Furthermore, our BMDMs did not activate STAT-1 and STAT-3 following IL-27 treatment, in keeping with another study (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) that also did not detect STAT-1 and STAT-3 phosphorylation in BMDMs following IL-27 treatment. In this study the authors could not detect induction of STAT-1&#x02013;dependent genes in BMDMs following IL-27 treatment and reported low levels of IL-27R expression, suggesting that these cells were &#x0201c;minimally responsive&#x0201d; to IL-27 (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). We also found low relative levels of IL-27R expression in our BMDMs, in accordance with this study (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and others who found low relative levels of IL-27R expression on F4/80<sup>+</sup> splenic macrophages (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and plastic adherent splenic macrophages (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), whereas we show that T cells do express the IL-27R, as others report (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Although this lack of STAT-1 and STAT-3 activation is in contrast to Iyer et al. (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), the reasons for the difference between our findings and those of Iyer et al. are presently unclear, but may be due to laboratory differences in generation and culture conditions of BMDMs. Note that our findings do not exclude IL-27 responsiveness by other types of macrophage or myeloid cell that may also respond in a manner not assessed in this study (<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated the effects of type I IFN on proinflammatory cytokine production. Addition of IFN-&#x003b2; to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages potently suppressed IL-12p40 production, in agreement with a number of studies in viral and some bacterial models showing suppression of IL-12 by type I IFN (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; production were also suppressed by type I IFN addition. Interestingly, and in contrast to these findings, autocrine type I IFN was also partially required for optimal IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1; production by macrophages following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, in agreement with a previous study where type I IFN signaling was required for IL-12 production following TLR stimulation (<xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). The discrepancy between our results with addition of IFN-&#x003b2; versus deficiency in type I IFN signaling appears to be due to the timing of type I IFN signaling relative to signaling through pattern recognition receptors, because 12 h of pretreatment with IFN-&#x003b2; resulted in increased levels of IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1; upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, whereas IFN-&#x003b2; treatment proximal to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection consistently resulted in suppression of IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1; production. This may indicate that distinct mechanistic programs of action of type I IFN exist, dependent on proximity to other stimuli (such as infection).</p><p>In contrast to IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1;, type I IFN signaling inhibited macrophage production of IL-1&#x003b2; protein following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection under all conditions tested. This is in clear agreement with recent studies in both mouse models (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and human cells (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and illustrates an important mechanism of type I IFN negative regulation of the host response, because IL-1 is crucial to protection during TB (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>).</p><p>Given that type I IFN induced IL-10 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages, we assessed whether IL-10 was mediating the inhibitory effects of type I IFN on IL-12p40, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2;. IFN-&#x003b2; treatment of IL-10&#x02013;deficient macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> revealed that IL-10 did indeed mediate much of the suppressive action of type I IFN on IL-12p40 production and was totally responsible for inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; production. Low levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12 in the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected mice have previously been associated with high type I IFN levels, although a role for IL-10 was not formally investigated (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, IL-10 appears to limit IL-12 production during mycobacterial infection (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and also limits the Th1 response and associated IFN-&#x003b3; production during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in mice (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These results suggest that IL-10 may be an important intermediary in type I IFN&#x02013;mediated disruption of the Th1 response during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection through suppression of macrophage production of cytokines such as IL-12. IL-10 also partially mediated suppression of IL-1&#x003b2; production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages, in agreement with a recent study (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), but suggests that most of inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; production by type I IFN in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages is through IL-10&#x02013;independent mechanisms. Analysis of <italic>Nos2</italic>-deficient macrophages suggested that iNOS is a significant mechanism additional to IL-10 through which type I IFN mediates its suppressive effects on IL-1&#x003b2; synthesis. Interestingly, in the context of IFN-&#x003b3; treatment, iNOS was also found to negatively regulate production of other cytokines, including IL-12 and IL-27.</p><p>We noted that even in the absence of the negative regulation of type I IFN or IL-10, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages rarely produced robustly detectable levels of the biologically active form of IL-12, IL-12p70. This suggested that IL-12p70 is under tight regulation by other factors and/or might require additional promoting signals for its induction in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages. IFN-&#x003b3; is known as an inducer of IL-12p70 (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and as a crucial activator of macrophages during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We therefore assessed the effects of IFN-&#x003b3; stimulation on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages and whether type I IFN (either autocrine or exogenous) could perturb macrophage responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b3;. IFN-&#x003b3; treatment enhanced IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1; production while suppressing IL-10 and IL-1&#x003b2; in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages. However, little to no IL-12p70 was induced by IFN-&#x003b3; in WT macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Only in the absence of either type I IFN signaling or IL-10 could IFN-&#x003b3; addition induce robustly detectable amounts of IL-12p70. This indicates that these two pathways act as important regulators of the macrophage response to IFN-&#x003b3; during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In particular, the ability of IFN-&#x003b3; to drive macrophage production of biologically active IL-12p70 in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> remains compromised when the type I IFN or IL-10 pathways are intact.</p><p>To mimic a situation in which an <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophage responds to both type I IFN and IFN-&#x003b3; present in the microenvironment, we infected macrophages with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and concomitantly added type I IFN and IFN-&#x003b3;. Strikingly, type I IFN completely abrogated the ability of IFN-&#x003b3; to downregulate IL-10 production and enhance IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1; production. Type I IFN therefore seems to play a dominant regulatory role in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages, which IFN-&#x003b3; is unable to overcome. How type I IFN blocks macrophage responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b3; remains unclear. Type I IFN can downregulate IFN-&#x003b3; receptor expression (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and inhibit signaling (<xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) to limit macrophage activation. In our system this mechanism is likely to be only partially active, because type I IFN did not block all effects of IFN-&#x003b3; on macrophages and only partially mediated effects on <italic>Ifngr1</italic> transcript levels. In particular, the ability of IFN-&#x003b3; to suppress IL-1&#x003b2; production was largely unaffected by IFN-&#x003b2; treatment, and if anything was actually increased by the presence of IFN-&#x003b2;. This suggests that the effects of type I IFN on macrophage IFN-&#x003b3; responsiveness are specific, rather than global.</p><p>Myeloid cells such as macrophages are known to be primary reservoirs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteria during TB (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A critical role of IFN-&#x003b3; is therefore to activate these cells to restrict intracellular bacterial growth through induction of antimicrobial effectors such as iNOS (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Our data suggest that type I IFN signaling has inhibitory effects on IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced macrophage restriction of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The mechanism for this remains unclear but may involve inhibition of reactive oxygen species induction (<xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show in the present study that type I IFN is a powerful negative regulator of the immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> at the level of the infected macrophage. Type I IFN suppresses both initial proinflammatory cytokine production by infected macrophages, in large part through induction of high levels of IL-10, and also strongly inhibits the macrophage&#x02019;s ability to respond to IFN-&#x003b3; stimulation. Type I IFN may therefore act to interrupt the Th1 immune response, which is crucial to host resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, through suppressing production of the proinflammatory cytokines that prime this response but also through making macrophages unresponsive to subsequent IFN-&#x003b3; feedback from Th1 cells and other IFN-&#x003b3; sources. Additionally, type I IFN may act directly to prevent IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;mediated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth restriction by macrophages, allowing a niche of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> permissive cells to develop.</p></sec>
