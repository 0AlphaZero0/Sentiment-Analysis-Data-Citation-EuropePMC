<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Until recently, tuberculosis (TB) was defined as a two-stage infection - active or latent. In contrast, current thinking suggests that TB may induce a broad spectrum of immune responses, dependent on the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> load and/or replication activity within infected individuals, so that the interplay of mycobacterial replication and host immune response results in disease, recovery from active infection, or a sub-clinical latent state <xref rid="pone.0106796-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106796-Sridhar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Understanding the interplay between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and host immune responses within this clinical spectrum remains a critical research goal <xref rid="pone.0106796-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, identification of biomarkers that can accurately predict the clinical status of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected individuals, and identify those who are at the highest risk of progressing from sub-clinical latent infections to clinically manifested active disease, also remains a fundamental challenge <xref rid="pone.0106796-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106796-Pai1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Novel transcriptomic approaches have improved our knowledge of the immune response to, and pathogenesis of, TB, providing new insight into potential biological markers that might eventually stratify <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0106796-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-OGarra1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. One major break-through from such approaches indicated a relationship between a type 1-interferon inducible gene signature and disease activity as assessed by chest x-ray <xref rid="pone.0106796-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Interestingly, in this paper the healthy latent TB infected individuals had gene signatures that clustered with both active TB and healthy control gene signatures. The authors suggested that the healthy latent TB infected individuals with gene signatures clustering with those of active TB, might be the ones about to develop active TB, although they did not prove this hypothesis in this paper. Subsequently, other studies have reported changes in gene expression profiles of other signatures within whole blood of TB patients before and after treatment, as well as in latently infected individuals and healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0106796-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although these approaches have generated exciting results, the cost and expertise needed to produce accurate results limit their practicability and efficiency, particularly in highly endemic and resource poor settings. Cheap, simplified, rapid and accurate alternatives to these approaches are therefore still needed.</p><p>Given the critical role of T-cells in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> immunity, approaches aiming to identify new TB biomarkers have previously been biased towards T-cells and T-cell associated molecules. However, recent reports suggesting various modulatory roles for B-cells in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-specific immune responses <xref rid="pone.0106796-Kozakiewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106796-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> have revitalised interest in B-cells as possible targets for new biomarkers <xref rid="pone.0106796-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In a previous study, we described higher frequencies of MBCs within the peripheral blood of healthy UK-donors who had previously visited or lived in highly TB-endemic areas compared to their counterparts who had neither visited nor stayed in such areas <xref rid="pone.0106796-Sebina1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. More recently, active TB patients who were successfully cured following treatment were found to present contrasting B-cell associated gene expression patterns within their blood, before and after treatment <xref rid="pone.0106796-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated whether the ratio of plasmablasts (PBs) to memory B-cells (MBCs) may accurately predict the clinical status of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected individuals living in a highly TB-endemic area. Plasmablasts are short-lived antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and are readily detected in peripheral blood during an early or on-going active infection, but they are rarely present in the circulation in the absence of antigen and, or, of viable, replicating pathogens <xref rid="pone.0106796-Odendahl1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

We reasoned that the presence of antigen-specific PBs in the absence of MBCs within the peripheral circulation may reflect a current or on-going active <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (clinically manifested disease); that the presence of PBs in addition to MBCs may reflect a resolving active or a subclinical latent infection; and that the presence of MBCs in the absence of PBs may reflect sterile immunity following infection and thus a healthy state.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PB and MBC responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens</title><p>Little is known about the peripheral blood B-cell responses induced by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.

We then compared the PB and MBC responses detected in these individuals to those detected in the active TB patients. Consistent with our hypothesis, and as described above, high PB numbers were characteristic of active TB patients, although MBCs were also detected within their peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106796-g002">Figure 2</xref>, filled circles).

Considering that we conducted most of our assays in different individuals, we could not directly assess this approach. Nevertheless, we reasoned that comparing median PB and MBC responses in active TB patients to those in the latently infected or uninfected community controls might reveal a pattern that would reflect likely PB:MBC ratios. Indeed, we observed that the median antigen-specific PB response was higher in the TB patients than in the uninfected and latently infected controls, but also higher in the latently infected than in the uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106796-t002">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the median antigen-specific MBC response was higher in the latently infected controls than in the active TB patients and uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106796-t002">Table 2</xref>). This data further suggests that PBs may be associated with an active TB phenotype and MBCs with a latent state. To explore this further, we analysed data from the group of 35 healthy community controls for whom we had data on both PB and MBC responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106796-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

These observations may be explained by the increase in mycobacterial loads due to the presence of viable replicating mycobacteria within these TB patients. These elevated mycobacterial loads may activate circulating mycobacteria-specific MBCs, which subsequently differentiate into new PB populations, and thus contribute to the elevation of PBs detected within the peripheral blood of active TB patients. In addition, the increase in mycobacterial loads may accelerate the activation and differentiation of naive B-cells, thereby contributing to the PB pool. Plasmablasts contribute to the increase in serum levels of protective antibodies during active infection, regardless of the pathogen. Increased serum antibodies are readily detected during TB infection <xref rid="pone.0106796-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106796-Raqib1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, although why such antibodies are not protective remains unknown.</p><p>It should be noted that we used frozen PBMCs from active TB patients and fresh PBMCs from healthy volunteers in our experiments.

Given this potential issue, we might expect the freeze/thaw process to selectively reduce numbers of PBs, which are activated B cells; however, we could clearly identify PB populations in our thawed PBMCs from active TB patients. Thus, if the freeze/thaw process did negatively affect PB numbers, we are likely to have underestimated the high PB:MBC ratio in these patients. In addition, a recent study showed that the freeze/thaw process did not affect influenza-specific PB numbers <xref rid="pone.0106796-Kyu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and in a more recent report, MBC responses were also largely unaffected by this process <xref rid="pone.0106796-Truck1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It is therefore likely that the freeze/thaw process did not significantly alter the numbers of PBs or MBCs that we report here.</p><p>Our study lacked conventional tests such as the TST or an IGRA that could independently confirm latent TB infection (LTBI) in our healthy controls. Nevertheless, our data is consistent with what we might expect from such assays: the proposed LTBI group showed responses to ESAT-6 and/or CFP10, whereas the LTBI negative group did not. In particular, the marked lack of B-cell responses to any mycobacterial antigens in those individuals with no TB-specific B-cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106796-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106796-t002">Table 2</xref>) suggests that these individuals are indeed <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> na&#x000ef;ve. Considering the relatively high prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in sub-Saharan Africa, some of the responses to ESAT-6 and/or CFP-10 detected in the LTBI group may be attributed to previous exposure to such mycobacterial species. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out completely, it is worth noting that the prevalence of infection with such mycobacterial species in these settings is much lower compared to that of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>

We propose that the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-specific PB:MBC ratio may serve as a valuable and early diagnostic marker for both latent and active TB infections in humans. We envision that the changes in the frequency of PBs or peripheral blood PB-specific responses might be an accurate way to identify an immediate and active immune response, and thus may be a useful predictor of an individual who is currently exposed to replicating <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. If we are correct, then the raised PB:MBC ratio observed across some antigens in a single healthy community control may be particularly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106796-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although we were unable to follow up this individual during the course of this study, our hypothesis would suggest that individuals of this phenotype may be progressing towards active, clinical disease. Clearly, further prospective studies need to be done before definitive conclusions can be made. Such studies may lead to the accurate detection of discreet stages of infection within latently infected individuals, as has been proposed <xref rid="pone.0106796-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and subsequently to early identification of those individuals who are most likely to progress to a clinically manifested active disease.

Prospective studies aiming to test the kinetics of this ratio among untreated, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> latently infected individuals who might progress towards active infection, or in newly identified active TB patients undergoing treatment, may provide better insight and validation of this concept. This may thus serve as a significant improvement to currently available methods for detecting <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, which cannot accurately distinguish between active and latent infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The ethics committees at Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) approved these studies.

<italic>In-vitro</italic> and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> B-cell ELISPOT assays were used to examine the mycobacteria-specific memory B cell (MBC) and plasmabast (PB) responses, respectively, in both active TB patients and the healthy community controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll Paque Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) density-gradient centrifugation, washed twice in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, UK) and resuspended in RPMI-1640 culture media (Invitrogen, UK) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Purified PBMCs from the blood of the active TB patients were stored in liquid nitrogen until used; those from the healthy community controls were used fresh in the ELISPOT assays. <italic>In-vitro</italic> ELISPOT assays were used to determine MBC responses in 116 healthy community controls. Separately, paired <italic>ex-vivo</italic> and <italic>in-vitro</italic> ELISPOT assays were used to determine matched PB and MBC responses in PBMCs from another 35 clinically healthy participants. For the active TB patients, PBMCs from 30 participants were analyzed using the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> ELISPOT to determine their PB responses. PBMCs from another 18 active TB cases were analyzed using the <italic>in-vitro</italic> ELISPOT assay to determine their MBC response. Due to limited blood volumes and PBMC numbers obtained from the active TB patients, we were unable to conduct both assays on samples from the same patient.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>
<italic>In-vitro</italic> ELISPOT assay</title><p>Frequencies of MBCs in peripheral blood were determined using an in-house <italic>in-vitro</italic> B-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT), previously described <xref rid="pone.0106796-Sebina1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Briefly, purified PBMCs (1x10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were stimulated with a cocktail of 6 &#x000b5;g/ml CpG, 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml PWM, 1.2 mg/ml SAC, 25 ng/ml recombinant human IL-10 (R&#x00026;D systems, UK) and 50 &#x000b5;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol for six days at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Polyclonal stimulated cells (4x10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were then transferred directly into wells of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, MAHAS4510) that was coated with either 100 &#x000b5;l of PBS containing <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-specific recombinant proteins (6 &#x000b5;g/ml PPD, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml ESAT-6, Ag85A, Ag85B, and CFP-10), 2 &#x000b5;g/ml Tetanus toxoid (TT, positive control) or with PBS alone (negative control). Plates were developed with a biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure fragment donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), strepavidin- AKP (BD biosciences) and its substrate (AP-conjugate substrate kit, Biorad, USA). Developed spots were counted using an AID ELISPOT reader (AID Diagnostika, Germany) and AID ELISPOT software (version 7.0). The frequencies of antigen-specific MBCs are presented as spot counts per million stimulated PBMCs. A positive ELISPOT response was defined as the presence of two or more spots in each replicate well, with the total number of spots in antigen coated wells being at least twice that observed in the PBS-coated wells that had no more than five spots.</p></sec><sec id="s5f"><title>
<italic>Ex-vivo</italic> ELISPOT assay</title><p>Short term <italic>ex-vivo</italic> ELISPOTs were used to determine the frequencies of antigen-specific IgG secreting plasmablasts in peripheral blood of TB patients and healthy controls. Ninety-six (96) ELISPOT- well filter plates (MAHA S4510, Millipore) were coated overnight with either 100 &#x000b5;l of PBS containing mycobacterium-specific recombinant proteins (6 &#x000b5;g/ml PPD, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml ESAT-6, Ag85A, Ag85B, and CFP-10). Tetanus toxoid (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) was used as positive control while PBS-coated wells served as negative controls. Plates were washed and blocked with RPMI containing 1% BSA at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hours. Purified PBMCs (2x10<sup>5</sup>/ml) were added into each antigen-coated well and the plates were incubated for 5 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Plates were washed with PBS and 0.05% PBS-Tween and developed with biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure fragment donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), strepavidin- AKP (BD biosciences) and its substrate (AP-conjugate substrate kit, Biorad, USA). Developed plates were air-dried and the number of resultant spots enumerated on an AID ELISPOT reader. Frequencies of antigen-specific PBs were calculated and later presented as spot forming units per million PBMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s5g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Collected data were entered into Excel and GraphPad Prism software. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 10.1. Frequencies of PBs and MBCs were not normally distributed and therefore non-parametric statistical tests were used. Comparisons of antigen-specific PB and MBC responses between healthy community controls and TB patients were made using an unpaired Wilcoxon sign rank test. Matched PB and MBC responses in a selected set of healthy community controls were compared using a paired Wilcoxon sign rank test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to test for correlations amongst various antigen-specific PB and MBC responses. Only statistically significant differences are shown.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0106796.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
