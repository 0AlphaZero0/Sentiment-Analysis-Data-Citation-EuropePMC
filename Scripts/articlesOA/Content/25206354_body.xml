<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is caused by infection with <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, a member of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTC). The mycobacterial species and strains that constitute the MTC can cause tuberculosis in a wide range of mammals and display 99.9% similarity at the nucleotide level (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Econometric analyses incorporating agricultural production and human health indices have placed BTB as the fourth most important disease of cattle, costing an estimated $3 billion on a global scale annually (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, as a zoonotic agent, <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection has important implications for human health (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> is normally transmitted via the inhalation of infectious bacilli, whereby infection is established in the lung. Evasion of host immune defenses enables the pathogen to survive and replicate within phagocytic macrophages, the primary innate immune cell that mediates the response to infection, and can result in dissemination of infection via the lymph system leading to disease progression and pathology (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Subsequent transmission of the pathogen to susceptible hosts maintains the cycle of infection. The immune response to BTB is complex and is largely characterized by macrophage-mediated development of protective T<sub>H</sub>1-type responses following initial exposure to the pathogen. It has been reported that the development of disease involves a transition from T<sub>H</sub>1 to non-protective T<sub>H</sub>2-type responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The progression of infection may also be due to the modulation and suppression of specific immune mechanisms by the pathogen (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In many developed countries, control and eradication programs have been put in place to facilitate early detection and removal of infected animals. In Ireland, the test and slaughter policy was introduced in the early 1950s as part of the national BTB eradication scheme (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This policy includes mandatory screening of animals in the national herd using the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT), alone or in combination with <italic>in vitro</italic> ELISA-based interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) release assays in infected herds, to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, due to limitations in both of these tests and also the presence of wildlife reservoirs (including the Eurasian badger, <italic>Meles meles</italic>) <italic>M. bovis</italic> has remained recalcitrant to eradication (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop novel diagnostics for early and reliable detection of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection in cattle herds.</p><p>The availability of a well-annotated bovine genome sequence with concomitant advances in high-throughput genomics technologies offers novel approaches to interrogate and better understand the immune response to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. Many transcriptomics studies of the host response to <italic>M. bovis</italic> have involved the analysis of blood-derived RNA from naturally or experimentally infected animals, as previous work has shown that for BTB, host immune responses occurring in peripheral blood reflect those at the primary site of disease (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Microarray analysis of peripheral blood-derived RNA has shown that transcriptional profiling can unambiguously differentiate animals by disease status and can identify immunomodulatory mechanisms associated with pathology (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has given rise to new methods for gene expression analysis based on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). This RNA-seq approach has a number of important advantages compared to microarray analysis, including unbiased whole-transcriptome profiling; the characterization and analysis of both sense and antisense transcription and novel transcripts; the identification of mRNA isoforms; increased precision and sensitivity for the quantification of lowly expressed transcripts; and the detection of expressed coding and regulatory DNA sequence variants that can influence phenotype [e.g., disease resistance and susceptibility] (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>To gain a deeper knowledge of the host transcriptional response to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, we have used RNA-seq to compare the peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) transcriptomes of eight animals naturally infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> and eight non-infected control animals. Differentially expressed (DE) genes identified from this analysis were further investigated using the Ingenuity<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Systems Pathway Analysis (IPA) Knowledgebase to detect overrepresented cellular pathways in response to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. We also compared the gene expression profiles generated from RNA-seq with data from the Affymetrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Bovine Genome Array using the same PBL-extracted RNA samples (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The 16 age-matched female Holstein-Friesian animals used in this study have been previously described (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The eight <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected cattle were selected from a panel of naturally infected animals identified during routine disease surveillance by the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. These animals had a positive result for both SICTT and whole blood IFN-&#x003b3;-based BOVIGAM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> assay tests (Prionics AG, Zurich, Switzerland). In addition, <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection was confirmed following detailed post-mortem pathological examination and culture. Non-infected control animals were selected from a herd with no recent history of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection and were shown to be negative for both the SICTT and IFN-&#x003b3; tests.

Based on the well-documented role of the T-cell response to mycobacterial infection, the top-ranking IPA canonical pathway (<italic>T-cell receptor signaling</italic>) was overlaid with the RNA-seq gene expression data, which indicated activation of this pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Further inspection of the IPA results showed <italic>Leukocyte extravasation signaling</italic> to be the second-ranked canonical pathway. Transcriptional suppression was observed for this pathway with several genes required for migration of leukocytes to the site of infection displaying reduced relative expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These include genes encoding leukocyte ligands required for endothelial adhesion such as <italic>ITGB2</italic> (&#x02212;1.29-fold), <italic>ITGAL</italic> (&#x02212;1.23-fold), and <italic>SPN</italic> (also known as <italic>CD43</italic>; &#x02212;1.42-fold). Reduced relative expression of the gene encoding the LFA-1 protein was also indirectly observed in these BTB-infected animals. LFA-1 is a complex formed from an &#x003b1;-chain encoded by <italic>ITGAL</italic> and a &#x003b2;-chain encoded by <italic>ITGB2</italic>; both <italic>ITGAL</italic> and <italic>ITGB2</italic> exhibited decreased relative expression as discussed above.

To directly compare gene expression profiles generated by the two platforms, we re-analyzed all microarray data and of the 24,072 probe sets represented on the microarray, 5,082 of these passed the filtering process and were designated as informative. An MDS plot generated from these 5,082 informative probe sets shows samples clustered according to their infection status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B); this pattern was also observed for these samples by Killick and colleagues using hierarchical clustering (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of all informative microarray probe sets identified 2,808 DE transcripts (FDR &#x02264;0.05) and mapping of these transcripts to the <italic>B. taurus</italic> UMD3.1.73 genome build yielded 1,398 DE genes with Ensembl IDs (Table S4 in Supplementary Material). This is substantially lower than the 2,757 DE genes previously reported by us for the same RNA samples (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This discrepancy may be explained by differences in the versions of the <italic>B. taurus</italic> reference genome used to annotate the microarray probe sets: for the previous study, we used the Btau4.0 genome assembly, while in the current study the UMD3.1.73 genome assembly was used.

Further examination of the results showed that 917 DE Ensembl genes had the same direction of expression (i.e., increased or decreased relative expression) on both platforms; 2,331 DE Ensembl genes were unique to the RNA-seq results (i.e., DE using RNA-seq but not DE on the microarray platform); and 479 DE Ensembl genes were unique to the microarray (i.e., DE on the microarray platform but not DE on the RNA-seq platform).

The larger number of IPA-identified canonical pathways from the RNA-seq results reflects the greater number of DE genes detected using this platform. Despite this, however, there was a notable level of overlap in the number of pathways identified using both platforms. The percentage of overlapping pathways between the two platforms was estimated as 50.2% for RNA-seq and 73.7% for the microarray (Tables&#x02009;S3 and S5 in Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="S3-8"><title>Correlation of the log fold-change in gene expression between the two platforms using all genes that passed filtering</title><p>We analyzed the correlation between the log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes (infected versus control) on both gene expression platforms. We hypothesized that genes with high differential fold-changes in expression based on RNA-seq analysis should also show high differential fold-changes based on the microarray data. Accordingly, these data would be expected to yield a significant, positive correlation. For this, all 12,294 genes and 5,082 probe sets that passed the filtering criteria across both sample groups for both RNA-seq and microarray analysis, respectively, were considered. Next, we identified all the genes, irrespective of significance, that were common to both data sets based on Ensembl gene ID, this involved matching the Ensembl IDs of the filtered genes in the RNA-seq data set with the Ensembl IDs of the filtered microarray probe sets. In total, 2,265 Ensembl IDs were identified in common between the two platforms. The log<sub>2</sub> fold-change values for these 2,265 genes (infected versus control) for both the RNA-seq and microarray data, irrespective of the significance of differential expression generated a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.88 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.001), which underlines the reproducibility and robustness of both platforms for investigations of differential gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S3-9"><title>Comparison of the fold-change and difference in expression values for RNA-seq and microarray data</title><p>We next investigated the correlation between fold-change in expression and gene expression levels.

For this, we compared the log<sub>2</sub> expression fold-changes with the log<sub>2</sub> differences in CPM between infected and control groups for the RNA-seq platform. We also compared the log<sub>2</sub> expression fold-changes with the log<sub>2</sub> differences in hybridization intensity between infected and control groups for the microarray platform. We hypothesized that if transcripts with the lowest expression levels gave the highest fold-change values, a negative correlation would be observed between log<sub>2</sub> expression fold-changes and log<sub>2</sub> differences for genes displaying increased relative expression in the infected group relative to the control group. Reciprocally, a positive correlation would be expected between log<sub>2</sub> expression fold-changes and log<sub>2</sub> differences for genes displaying decreased relative expression for the same group contrast.</p><p>For the RNA-seq platform, all 12,294 genes that passed filtering were used. Of these, 6,243 displayed an increase in relative expression and 6,051 displayed a decrease in relative expression, irrespective of significance.

For the microarray platform, we used all 5,082 probe sets that passed filtering of which 2,551 displayed an increase in expression and 2,531 displayed a decrease in expression, irrespective of significance. Spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0.61 and &#x02212;0.64 were observed for genes displaying increased and decreased relative expression, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001). The correlation coefficients for both the RNA-seq and microarray platforms for genes with increased and decreased relative expression do not support the hypothesis detailed above; therefore, we conclude that there is no obvious relationship between gene expression level and fold-change in expression.</p></sec><sec id="S3-10"><title>Dynamic range of RNA-seq and microarray data</title><p>To investigate the dynamic range of the RNA-seq and microarray platforms, the log<sub>2</sub> reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) from the RNA-seq data and the log<sub>2</sub> intensities from the microarray data were used; only genes and probe sets that passed the filtering criteria (12,294 and 5,082, respectively) were considered for this analysis. The lowest expression value was subtracted from the highest expression value for each platform. For the RNA-seq platform, the gene displaying the lowest expression level was <italic>MUC5B</italic> (log<sub>2</sub> RPKM of &#x02212;6.49), while the gene with the highest value was <italic>COX1</italic> (log<sub>2</sub> RPKM of 13.46); this yielded a log<sub>2</sub> dynamic range of 19.96. It is important to note that as RPKM values are proportions, values &#x0003c;1.0 will yield a negative result when log-transformed. For the microarray platform, the probe set with the lowest log<sub>2</sub> intensity was Bt.29403.1.s1_at (4.89) and the probeset with the highest log<sub>2</sub> intensity was AFFX-Crex-5_at (13.90), yielding a log<sub>2</sub> dynamic range of 9.01.

The target tissue for studies of the host response has generally been peripheral blood collected from infected and non-infected individuals or animals; peripheral blood provides an easily accessible biological sample that reflects the host immunological and pathological changes induced at the site of infection (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). For example, Berry and colleagues identified a microarray-derived 393 transcript biomarker signature, characterized by type 1 interferon-inducible genes, which discriminated active human TB patients from latently infected and healthy control individuals (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Furthermore, microarray-based comparative analysis of the peripheral blood transcriptome of active human tuberculosis cases and sarcoidosis patients (an analogous granulomatous disease of the respiratory tract of unknown etiology) also revealed a transcriptional signature that differentiated these two pathologically similar diseases (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Similarly for BTB, pan-genomic and immuno-specific microarray analysis of peripheral blood has demonstrated that <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected and non-infected animals can be unambiguously differentiated by disease status. Moreover, downstream analysis of the DE genes provided functional genomics evidence that active BTB is associated with the suppression of host innate immune responses and impairment of T-cell signaling (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding the remarkable progress in functional genomics studies of the immunobiology and host&#x02013;pathogen interactions, microarray studies of the host response to mycobacterial infections are not without limitations. For example, microarrays are limited to analysis of genes/transcripts for which probes can be generated from functionally annotated genome resources. In addition, quantification of gene expression indirectly from hybridization signal intensities constrains the dynamic range for lowly and highly expressed gene transcripts. Also, the measurement of gene expression can be hampered by probes that differ in their hybridization affinities with the target mRNA and by background non-specific hybridization, particularly for lowly expressed genes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, RNA-seq technologies, which are based on high-throughput sequencing and subsequent counting of all expressed RNA transcripts present in a biological sample, have several advantages for quantifying RNA abundance and unraveling the complexity of the host transcriptome following mycobacterial infection. These include unbiased global gene expression analysis (the entire transcriptome is normally surveyed), detection of allele-specific expression, and cataloging of novel transcripts, RNA classes (e.g., long non-coding RNA transcripts), and splice variants that are rarely quantifiable using microarray technologies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Also, RNA-seq analysis is based on digital counts of reads that map to annotated genes within a reference genome, thus offering a more precise and sensitive method to identify and quantify DE genes than analog microarray hybridization intensities. Consequently, for the present study we have compared the peripheral blood transcriptomes of non-infected control animals and animals naturally infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> (eight samples per group) using RNA-seq and compared these results to parallel data obtained using the pan-genomic Affymetrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Bovine Genome Array.</p><sec id="S4-11"><title>Functional biology of RNA-seq results</title><p>A mean of 13.2 million 78-mer reads per individually barcoded RNA-seq library was obtained and this yielded a mean of 1.03&#x02009;Gb of sequence data per library. A mean of 11.8 million reads (89% of the mean number of library reads) per library mapped to unique locations in the bovine UMD3.1 reference genome. This is higher than previously reported comparable studies: Nalpas and colleagues observed that 63.6% of reads mapped to unique UMD3.1 regions and Churbanov and colleagues observed that 71.2% of reads mapping to the Btau 4.0 reference genome (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Analysis of the gene coverage from these uniquely mapped reads revealed that 17,792 genes from a total of 24,616 annotated bovine genes gave at least 1 sequence read in at least 1 of the 16 individual libraries. As accurate quantification of gene expression is reliant on sequencing depth, whereby low sequencing coverage can lead to the generation of false-positive DE genes (type I errors) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), we have used a stringent sequencing-depth filtering criterion to remove lowly expressed genes. This filtering involved the retention of genes displaying more than one CPM in eight or more individual libraries; 12,294 genes (49.9% of annotated <italic>B. taurus</italic> genes) were retained for downstream differential expression analyses. The number of biological replicates (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) and mean sequencing depth per library achieved in the present study is sufficient for the accurate quantification and analysis of DE genes with a corresponding reduction in the number of type I errors due to lowly expressed genes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>Previous work by our group and others has demonstrated that a functional genomics approach can highlight novel aspects of the complex etiology of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection in cattle. These studies have confirmed the role of T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokines and chemokines and innate immune receptors (e.g., TLR genes) in mediating the response to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. Moreover, these investigations support the hypothesis that the immunoevasive mechanisms used by the pathogen during infection are reflected in the host transcriptome at the peripheral blood level; in particular, the suppression of innate immune signaling, which leads to an inferior adaptive immune response (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, RNA-seq was used to identify a total of 3,250 DE genes in the infected group relative to the control group; of these, 1,579 genes displayed increased relative expression and 1,671 genes showed reduced relative expression. The number of DE genes identified here through RNA-seq analysis exceeds the number of DE gene previously reported by Killick et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for the same RNA samples (2,757 DE genes; 1,281 and 1,476 genes displaying increased and decreased relative expression, respectively). This finding emphasizes the increased sensitivity of RNA-seq compared to microarrays for studies of differential gene expression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for genes involved in inflammation and immunity. T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokines and chemokines, such as <italic>CXCL6</italic> and <italic>IL8</italic>, were among the top-ranking DE genes based on fold-change in expression; additional innate immune genes, such as <italic>CCL4, CXCR4, CXCR7, IL1A, IL8, IL10</italic>, and <italic>TLR4</italic> also shown increased expression in the <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected group relative to the controls. Several innate immune genes also displayed reduced relative expression including <italic>CXCL10, DEFB10, IL12, IL18</italic>, and <italic>IL27</italic>. These results suggest that although innate immune genes play a role in mediating the host response to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, these genes may also serve as targets for immunomodulation by the pathogen to facilitate survival in the host. For example, <italic>IL12, IL18</italic>, and <italic>IL27</italic> encode cytokines that have all been shown to play key roles in initiating and controlling the adaptive immune response to mycobacterial infection (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>); suppression of these genes may result in the development of an inferior cellular response to infection leading to disease progression. The increased relative expression of the <italic>IL10</italic> gene, which encodes an immunosuppressive cytokine, may also result in the suppression of host innate immune responses to infection resulting in mycobacterial persistence within the host (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Collectively, these findings support our previous work, which hypothesized that the suppression of innate immune expression and signaling limits the initiation and maintenance of an appropriate adaptive immune response, contributing to the progression of BTB disease (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis of the DE genes using the IPA Knowledgebase identified additional cellular mechanisms within several of the top-ranking canonical pathways, which may be subject to immunomodulation by the pathogen, including the <italic>Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling</italic> and <italic>Tec Kinase Signaling</italic> pathways. The <italic>Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling</italic> pathway exhibited a decrease in expression for many genes encoding positive modulators of this pathway, including <italic>SPN</italic> (also known as <italic>CD43</italic>), <italic>ITGAL, ITGB2</italic>, and <italic>PECAM1</italic> (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Leukocyte extravasation refers to the transendothelial migration of activated leukocytes from the blood into infected tissue and is vital for immune surveillance and defense (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). This process, which requires the adherence of leukocytes to the endothelial surface of blood vessels followed by transmigration through the endothelial blood vessel cell layer into the infected tissue, is mediated by chemokines and several cell surface proteins and adhesion molecules including selectins and integrins (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Within the IPA-identified <italic>Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling</italic> pathway, transcriptional suppression was observed for several leukocyte ligands required for endothelial adhesion during extravasation. <italic>SPN, ITGAL</italic>, and <italic>ITGB2</italic> encode the CD43 and the CD11b and CD18 leukocyte cell surface ligands, respectively [the latter of which can complex with different protein partners to form different integrins such as LFA-1 and MAC1 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>)], which are required for leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial cells and subsequent transmigration of the leukocytes into infected tissue (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). <italic>PECAM1</italic> encodes a selectin protein found at intercellular endothelial junctions and is also required for transmigration across these barriers (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Lower expression of these ligands may result in reduced leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection, leading to an impaired adaptive immune response to contain or eradicate <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection in the host, ultimately leading to disease progression. In addition, these findings lend further support to the hypothesis that the immunoevasion mechanisms used by the pathogen are reflected in the host transcriptome.</p><p>Hematological analysis of blood samples taken from the animals analyzed in the current study showed a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) and a significant decrease in the mean number of monocytes (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) for the infected animals relative to the control group (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Conversely, no significant differences were observed in the mean number of neutrophils between the two sample groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.05).
