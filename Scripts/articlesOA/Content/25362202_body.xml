<p>Tuberculosis represents a major public health threat with &#x0003e;1.5 million deaths annually. Despite intensive investigations, rapid formulation of diagnosis of active tuberculosis remains a major obstacle to the global control of tuberculosis disease [<xref rid="CIU795C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The recent development of multiplexed assays in proteomics, transcriptomics, or metabolomics may provide the basis for developing highly sensitive and specific tools for active tuberculosis diagnosis [<xref rid="CIU795C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIU795C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to molecular biology assays, recent observations have indicated that immunological measures may be instrumental in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis. We have recently shown using flow cytometry that the cytokine profile of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>)-specific CD4 T cells allowed a strong immunological discrimination between patients with active tuberculosis and latent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (LTBI) [<xref rid="CIU795C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, consistent with a previous study [<xref rid="CIU795C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we recently confirmed that <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8 T-cell responses were predominantly (&#x0003e;70%) found in patients with active tuberculosis compared to those with LTBI (15%) [<xref rid="CIU795C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the basis of these previous observations, we hypothesized that the combined assessment of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses could result in improved diagnosis of active tuberculosis.</p><p>To test our working hypothesis, we analyzed both the functional profile of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T-cell responses and the presence of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8 T-cell responses in 194 subjects diagnosed with active tuberculosis or LTBI, and performed multivariate regression analysis to assess their relative or combined capacity to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection.</p><p>The results show that both individual immunological measures had variable power to discriminate between active tuberculosis and LTBI.

Here, we demonstrate that the detection of CD8 T-cell responses can discriminate between active tuberculosis and LTBI also in adults, but is substantially less powerful than the <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T-cell response (ie, single TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;producing CD4 T cells). More importantly, the multivariate analysis combining both the functional profile of CD4 T cells and the presence of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8 T cells led to the identification of a new variable (SCORE) and to a significantly improved discrimination between patients with active vs latent tuberculosis.</p><p>The 2 immunological measures, that is, increase in the percentage of single <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;producing CD4 T cells and the detection of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8 T cells, when used in combination have a sensitivity (81.1%) and a specificity (86.5%) in the same range of other immunological assays measuring only IFN-&#x003b3; such as the T.SPOT.TB and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test while largely superior to the tuberculin skin test [<xref rid="CIU795C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the present flow cytometry&#x02013;based assay has the advantage of discriminating between active and latent tuberculosis, which is not the case for the 2 assays measuring only <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3;. In this regard, recent studies have identified other immunological markers that may discriminate between active and latent tuberculosis. The new markers include IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 single T-cell responses [<xref rid="CIU795C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the decrease of CD27 expression in <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells [<xref rid="CIU795C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the former markers were analyzed in a very small number (&#x0003c;20) of patients, and the latter has been shown to discriminate between active and chronic tuberculosis only in pediatric patients [<xref rid="CIU795C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and to be associated with persistent active tuberculosis in adult patients [<xref rid="CIU795C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the flow cytometry&#x02013;based assay and the combined use of the 2 immunological measures described in the present study represent the most instrumental tool for discriminating between active and latent tuberculosis in adult patient populations.</p><p>The sensitivity of immunologically based assays in discriminating between active and latent tuberculosis is inferior to that of molecular assays such as the Xpert MTB/RIF test, which is based on DNA amplification and has a sensitivity of 99.8% in smear-positive and culture-positive cases and 90.2% in smear-negative and culture-positive cases. However, the limitation of this test is that it can be performed only on sputum samples, which are difficult to collect in children.</p><p>With regard to the feasibility of implementing this technology in developing countries with high tuberculosis prevalence, the antibody panel to measure these <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses has been validated in our laboratory for diagnostic use and routinely performed on a Facscanto flow cytometer at the Lausanne University Hospital. The implementation of the present test in laboratories in developing countries is certainly feasible if the appropriate flow cytometry equipment is available. However, the assay is currently performed on blood mononuclear cell preparations, and the possibility of performing the assay on total blood will facilitate substantially the implementation of the test in laboratories in developing countries.</p><p>In conclusion, the present flow cytometry&#x02013;based assay and the combination of 2 immunological measures&#x02014;<italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells producing TNF-&#x003b1; and the detection of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8 T-cell responses&#x02014;represent a powerful diagnostic tool to discriminate between active tuberculosis and latent infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/ciu795/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
