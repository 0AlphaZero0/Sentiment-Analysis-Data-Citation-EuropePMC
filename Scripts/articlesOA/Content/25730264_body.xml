<p id="P2">The innate immune system is crucial for the early detection of invading pathogens and functions by recognizing specific PAMPs via germ line-encoded PRRs<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.

Cyclic di-nucleotides (CDNs), which are either produced by invading bacterial pathogens (such as, c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP) or produced endogenously in response to foreign DNA (cyclic GMP-AMP, cGAMP) represent one such category of small molecules that, during infection, act as triggers for innate immune responses leading to induction of Type I interferons (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>, infection with the Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO strain resulted in a significant reduction in IFN-&#x003b2; induction by J774.1 cells compared to infection with the Mtb-CDC1551. Conversely, infection with the Mtb-OE strain resulted in an enhanced induction of IFN-&#x003b2; by both resting and activated J774.1 cells. Notably, Mtb-OE infected cells also secreted significantly higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1; compared to the Mtb-WT infected cells, whereas Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO infected cells produced lower TNF-&#x003b1; levels compared to other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). Moreover, the patterns of IRF pathway activation in THP1-human monocyte cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) and IFN-&#x003b2; responses in mouse primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>) were comparable further confirming our hypothesis.

Induction of IFN-&#x003b2; was further confirmed by real time RT-PCR of the BMDC cells infected with various <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).

We did not notice any growth attenuation of the Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO strain.

Fluorescence confocal imaging demonstrated a considerably higher percentage of cells (~15%) exhibiting LC3 puncta formation in the case of Mtb-OE infection compared to Mtb-CDC1551 (~10%) and Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO infections (~6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In addition, Western blot analysis of endogenous LC3 revealed an increase in conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the Mtb-OE infected cells, indicating hyper-activation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also observed a considerably higher percentage of cells exhibiting pTBK1 positivity suggesting activation of IRF pathway<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> in the Mtb-OE infected J774.1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that hyper-induction of autophagy by macrophages may be one of the contributing factors that restricts the intracellular growth of Mtb-OE strain.</p><p id="P8">Next we examined the virulence and pathogenicity of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains in mouse aerosol infection models. Remarkably, compared to WT infection (median time to death [MTD] of 150 days), we observed a significant increase in the survival of Mtb-OE infected mice (MTD 321 days). In contrast, the Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO strain which is c-di-AMP deficient showed reduced survival with an MTD of 77 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Concomitantly, the Mtb-OE strain also exhibited growth attenuation as evidenced by significantly reduced lung and spleen bacillary loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Gross and histo-pathological findings of mouse lungs and spleens correlated well with the bacterial organ burden observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). The lungs of Mtb-OE infected-mice showed significantly fewer and smaller tubercle-like lesions compared to other groups. Concordantly, while Mtb-CDC1551, Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO, and Mtb-COMP strain-infected mice exhibited considerable splenomegaly, spleens of the Mtb-OE infected mice appeared normal in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Altogether, these observations clearly demonstrate attenuation of virulence in the c-di-AMP over-expressing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain.</p><p id="P9">Next, we compared the mouse serum cytokine levels between these groups at an early stage of disease: 2 weeks post-infection. Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in mouse and human cells, we observed increased IFN-&#x003b2; levels in the serum of Mtb-OE infected mice compared to the Mtb-CDC1551 and Mtb-<italic>disA</italic>-KO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In addition, the Mtb-OE group exhibited significantly higher serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Since Type I IFN (IFN-&#x003b2;) is known to counter-regulate Type II IFN (IFN-&#x003b3;) responses<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we measured IFN-&#x003b3; levels in the serum of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>).

Hence, we next examined the host cytosolic sensors that may detect <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-derived c-di-AMP starting with helicase DDX41, a cytosolic DNA and CDN receptor that signals via STING<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. We performed shRNA-mediated knocked down of DDX41 using RAW-Blue&#x02122; ISG cells (InvivoGen) that allow colorimetric measurement of the induction of the IRF pathway. Knockdown of DDX41 caused a significant defect in activation of the IRF pathway and reduced IFN-&#x003b2; induction following infection with all the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a, b, c</xref>). We also observed a significantly reduced TNF-&#x003b1; production by the DDX41 knock-down cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>). These results suggest that DDX41 is a key pattern recognition receptor for both DNA and c-di-AMP, and that DDX41 regulates the induction of Type I IFNs as well as TNF-&#x003b1; following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p id="P11">We then investigated the contribution of STING to the c-di-AMP-mediated IFN-&#x003b2; response during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. A partial knock-down of STING in human THP1 cells showed considerably lower IFN-&#x003b2; induction than control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Moreover, all <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains failed to activate the IRF pathway or induce IFN-&#x003b2; in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage IRF reporter cells lacking STING (STING-KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b, c, d</xref>). However, LPS, which stimulates Type I IFN through STING-independent pathways, induced elevated IFN-&#x003b2; response even in STING-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). These results confirm that, in addition to its role in bacterial DNA mediated responses, STING is an essential component for c-di-AMP-mediated activation of the IRF pathway during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, infection of macrophages with <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacille Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), which is known to lack the Esx-1 secretion system, also showed activation of the IRF pathway at levels 20&#x02013;60% of those seen following infection with either the Mtb-CDC1551 or the Erdman strain, a WT <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain considered to be highly virulent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Importantly, the c-di-AMP over-expressing <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG strain (BCG-OE) produced a significantly higher IRF and IFN-&#x003b2; response than <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG itself, thus strongly suggesting that bacterial-derived c-di-AMP gains access to the host cell cytosol despite the absence of an Esx-1 secretion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). These experiments indicate that, while contributory to overall type I IFN response, Esx-1 may not be essential for c-di-AMP-triggered IRF pathway activation. However, further studies with ESX-1 deleted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains may provide direct evidence for contribution of ESX-1 secretion system in c-di-AMP mediated responses during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p id="P12">Next we evaluated the role of cGAS in the detection of bacterial c-di-AMP.

While loss of cGAS resulted in a considerably reduced IFN-&#x003b2; response compared to cells with intact cGAS (WT), all c-di-AMP overproducing strains continued to show significantly higher induction of IFN-&#x003b2; in cGAS-KO cells compared to their respective WT mycobacterial strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>). Further, both WT and cGAS-KO BMDMs produced comparable levels of IFN-&#x003b2; following stimulation with synthetic c-di-AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Real time RT-PCR for IFN-b in BMDCs further confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). These experiments show that while c-di-AMP is a key ligand for IFN-&#x003b2; induction irrespective of cGAS, a significant part of the overall IFN-b response during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is cGAS dependent and hence is probably due to bacterial DNA.</p><p id="P13">Our data thus reveal the involvement of c-di-AMP as an <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PAMP that triggers host cell IFN-&#x003b2; secretion and autophagy. These observations expand upon earlier studies which suggested that mycobacterial DNA is the exclusive ligand for inducing the Type I IFN response and that the bacterial Esx-1 secretion apparatus is required for CSP activation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Our findings, which employed multiple bacterial strains (the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CDC1551 and Erdman strains, and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG) each modified to overexpress c-di-AMP and a variety of host phagocytic cells including those defective in important mediators of the CSP (STING, DDX41, and cGAS), consistently demonstrated that c-di-AMP, not bacterial DNA alone, is a key mediator of Type I IFN responses. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> lists major differences in our methods compared with those of earlier studies and reveals that strain, host cell, and methodological differences may have allowed the importance of c-di-AMP to have been overlooked in earlier studies.</p><p id="P14">We considered the possibility that c-di-AMP-mediated changes in other bacterial antigens might affect Type I IFN response through NOD signaling as reported by Pandey <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.

Moreover, several publications have also demonstrated that NOD signaling is dispensable for IRF activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Thus, we feel that indirect effects of c-di-AMP on other bacterial PAMPs are unlikely to account for the IFN-&#x003b2; responses we observe.
