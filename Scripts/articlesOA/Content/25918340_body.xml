<p>DCs are a heterogeneous group of professional APCs. Upon activation, DCs migrate to secondary lymphoid organs and present antigen to their cognate T cells for the induction of adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Banchereau and Steinman, 1998</xref>). In human cancer, there is now clinical evidence suggesting that the induction or activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can contribute to the arrest of tumor growth and increased patient survival. In principle, targeting tumor antigens to DCs may enhance protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses due to the ability of DCs to cross-present exogenous antigens (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Segura and Villadangos, 2009</xref>). In cross-presentation, exogenous proteins are internalized, processed, and presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by MHC class I molecules. Specific DC populations (CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>/CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs in the mouse, blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs in humans) are thought to be particularly adept in cross-presentation of antigens compared with others (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bachem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jongbloed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Poulin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Romani et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Studies examining the DCs in the skin, the main targets of vaccines, showed that healthy human skin displays multiple DC populations:Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epidermis and interstitial DCs in the dermis consisting of CD1a<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup>-expressing DCs (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lenz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nestle et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Klechevsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Klechevsky, 2013</xref>). CD141 was recently reported to mark a population within the dermal CD1a<sup>(dim)</sup> DCs and is also known to be a marker expressed on dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Haniffa et al., 2012</xref>). We, and others, have previously shown that human epidermal LCs are more efficient at priming naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into potent cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) compared with the dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ratzinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Klechevsky et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Polak et al., 2012</xref>). Dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs were later shown to induce regulatory T cells (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2012</xref>) and impaired priming of CTLs due to their IL-10 production and the expression of the inhibitory immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) receptors (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Banchereau et al., 2012a</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).</p><p>Although cellular heterogeneity has been studied extensively in the immune system, understanding the biological functions of various DC subsets in humans is underdeveloped relative to the mouse. The alignment of DC subsets between mice and humans is of key importance in correlating human studies with mouse in vivo experiments. Transcriptional profiling is a powerful tool that has been used to examine several aspects of antigen presentation identity (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Crozat et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>). These and other studies used gene-centric, fold-change-based approaches to focus on the implications of expression differences between individual genes. More recent studies have integrated methods to harness the power of combining datasets and the coordinate expression of genes across cell types and species (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Crozat et al., 2010b</xref>). These studies have helped identify pathways related to disease (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chaussabel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>), hematopoietic lineage differentiation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Novershtern et al., 2011</xref>) and T cell differentiation state (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Doering et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used a transcriptional profiling approach combined with network-based computational analysis and functional assays as a tool for investigating the functional similarities that might exist between human skin DCs and the mouse cross-presenting CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>/CD103<sup>+</sup> DC subsets.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of coherent functional modules of co-expressed genes</title><p>Determining the homology between the murine and the human DC systems is an important unresolved issue, not only for the appropriate translation of mouse data for clinical use, but also to develop better preclinical models for human disease. One of the main controversies in the DC literature is the contribution of LCs in human versus mouse immunity (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Romani et al., 2010</xref>). To reconcile the functional differences between mouse and human LCs, we performed a cross-species comparison using co-expression module analysis between human cutaneous DCs and mouse DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This type of analysis groups genes together based on the similarity of their changes between subsets. We applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to define conserved transcriptional modules (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). This computational approach is based on the idea that the probability for multiple transcripts to follow a complex pattern of expression across dozens of conditions only by chance is low. Thus, groups of genes that segregate together across many different conditions should constitute coherent and biologically meaningful transcriptional units. Data from multiple DC subsets were analyzed to define coordinately expressed transcripts that were grouped together to define a module. Specifically, the degree of &#x0201c;closeness&#x0201d; between all pairs of genes was defined by Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients. Modules were then compared between species. Strong correlations thus identified genes that have the most similar expression patterns across the samples in the dataset.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental strategy.</bold> The research strategy showing the computational and functional analyses that are involved in identifying and validating functional homology between human and mouse DC subsets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20131675R_Fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Construction of mouse DC transcriptional modules</title><p>We took advantage of the large compendium of murine DC expression data that are available through the Immgen database. Overall, we used the WGCNA algorithm on 116 samples encompassing 36 DC subpopulations (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>) to construct and define modules. For each module, representative eigen genes could be defined that reflect the collective behavior of each module. Using this approach, we were able to define each cell type by the behavior of 16 independent modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20131675/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1</ext-link>). Each module represented specific components from 19 different pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Modules showed a large degree of cell specificity in their expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). For example, expression of module Mm2 was enriched in the lymph node migratory populations of DCs, expression of module Mm3 was enriched in pDCs, and expression of Mm1 was specific to thymic and CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> small intestine subpopulations, whereas expression of Mm6 consisted of genes whose regulation was shared between the CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> skin draining lymph node. Along the same lines, module Mm16 included genes specific for CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs.

A functional relationship between multiple components was clearly observed in several modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). For instance, module Mm4 is enriched in genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, which is a distinct feature of murine pDCs. In contrast, TCA cycle genes are enriched in Mm1, which is characteristic of thymic DCs. Importantly, Mm1 also showed significant enrichment in genes involved in antigen cross-presentation and related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This module was expressed in thymic and small intestine CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, suggesting that these cell types are particularly efficient in cross-presentation among murine DCs. Importantly, expression of XCR1, the definitive marker of cross-presenting cell types in mice (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bachem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crozat et al., 2010a</xref>), was also strongest in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, these cell types, uniquely expressed CD8&#x003b1; and CD103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, bottom).

GSEA is used to provide a statistical evaluation for the enrichment of a defined set of genes within a transcriptional profile. The gene set specific to the cross-presenting blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs was analyzed against the transcriptional profiles of all the different skin DC subsets.

As previously reported (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Klechevsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Banchereau et al., 2012b</xref>), LCs are powerful stimulators of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, whereas dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs are weak in comparison.

Two representative experiments of six performed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20131675R_Fig7"/></fig><p>To determine the capacity of the DC subsets to cross-present external unprocessed antigens to naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, sorted LCs, and dermal DC subsets (dermal CD1a<sup>(dim)</sup>CD141<sup>+</sup>, CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD141<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, or CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs) were incubated with recombinant MART-1 protein and cultured for 9 d with autologous naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and soluble CD40L. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells primed by LCs induced higher amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; in response to restimulation with MART-1&#x02013;loaded DCs compared with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells primed by other skin DC subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). To measure the expansion of epitope-specific T cells, DCs from an HLA-A201<sup>+</sup> donor were exposed to MART-1<sub>21-35</sub> peptide (YTTAEEAAGIGILTV) that contains the HLA-A201&#x02013;restricted MART-1 decamer epitope (MART-1<sub>26-35</sub> EAAGIGILTV).

CD40L was added to activate the DCs.

Thus, LCs are highly adept for cross-priming of soluble antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Characterization of functionally distinct DC subsets in mice acquires special significance if analogous counterparts exist in humans. Unlike the lymphoid system of T and B cells, identifying equivalent DC subsets based on the expression of selected surface receptors has proven to be inaccurate (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Crozat et al., 2010b</xref>). In this study, we constructed a functional module strategy that takes into account the biological variability inherent to a specific DC subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Human systems immunology approaches have already been very powerful to study regulatory networks that underline immune processes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Amit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buonaguro and Pulendran, 2011</xref>). Several major advantages of transcriptional co-expression networks make such studies a future step in the genomic understanding of the relationship between mouse and human DCs. First, transcriptional network analysis is less dependent on the magnitude of change in expression of any individual gene. Network analysis elucidates connections between genes and pathways to be revealed that might otherwise have been unappreciated (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2004a</xref>). Second, network analysis reveals genes and pathways that are predicted to be central to the biological system being analyzed (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jeong et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, network analysis identifies modules of highly correlated genes representing transcriptional developmental programs that can serve as comparative factors in determining human mouse analogues. Transcriptional co-expression networks may thus facilitate a deeper understanding of complex cellular systems.</p><p>Using this method, we found that human skin DCs share key transcriptional modules with mouse DCs. Specifically, the human dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs displayed functional similarities with the mouse CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs that was related to MDA and RIGI type I IFN induction and signaling, suggesting that dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs might be an important initial source of type I IFN production in response to a viral invasion on the skin, even before the migration of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) to the skin.</p><p>We also found that human LCs displayed functional similarities with the mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC subsets that co-expressed CD103 and the chemokine receptor XCR1. These cells include the mouse thymic and small intestine DCs. Interestingly, both mouse thymic DCs and a unique CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> small-intestine DCs were particularly efficient at priming T cell responses (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dresch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto et al., 2011</xref>). Functionally, human LCs were the most adept at priming allogeneic naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into effector CTLs compared with the other skin populations. They were also highly effective at cross-priming soluble antigens to syngeneic naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>LCs have long been considered to be the major sensitizing cells in the skin by initiating protective immunity in naive resting T cells. A role in allergic hypersensitivity was first reported in humans and guinea pigs (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Silberberg et al., 1976</xref>). They were shown to effectively expand pathogen-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, rather than T regulatory (T reg) cells in the skin upon activation (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Seneschal et al., 2012</xref>). Although in the human these DCs play a critical role in immunity, the relevance of LCs to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated immunity in mice is still disputed. In particular, mouse LCs were shown to be dispensable over the dermal Langerin<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs for inducing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in several viral infection, tumor, and self-antigen models (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Igy&#x000e1;rt&#x000f3; et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kautz-Neu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gomez de Ag&#x000fc;ero et al., 2012</xref>), whereas in other cases they were found to be essential for protective immunity (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sparber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Liard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The identification of two different types of mouse LCs (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Ser&#x000e9; et al., 2012</xref>) may be important in the interpretation of these studies.</p><p>Although this is not the case in mice, the only skin DC subset that expresses Langerin in humans are the Langerhans cells of the epidermis. The best indication is that no Langerin-expressing cells could be detected in the dermis by immunofluorescence staining of human skin tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). However, occasionally a small proportion (&#x0223c;1%) of Langerin<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the dermal cell suspension (Fig. S1 A, gate II). Because these cells expressed higher amounts of CD1a compared with the intermediate dermal CD1a population (Fig. S1 C) and they also expressed EpCam, we surmised that they were likely to represent LCs that migrate through the dermis, as proposed for a similar population that was observed in the mouse (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nagao et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, they may simply be residues of LCs of the epidermis that remain after its separation from the dermis. Because these cells were too rare to study and we also could not exclude the fact that these might be contaminating LCs, we excluded them from the current analysis.</p><p>Previously identified differences between mouse and human LCs may, however, further help explain the discrepancy between the two species. For example, in the mouse, LCs resemble tissue-resident macrophages; they are developmentally dependent on M-CSFR (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ginhoux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), express macrophage-specific markers such as F4/80 and CD11b, migrate poorly to lymph nodes relative to the migration of conventional DCs to lymph nodes, constitutively secrete IL-10 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Igyarto et al., 2009</xref>), and have little to no expression of Zbtb46. This suggests a macrophage identity rather than a DC identity (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Meredith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Satpathy et al., 2012</xref>). On the contrary, human LCs do not express any of the macrophage markers, they are negative for CD11b, express IL-15 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Klechevsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Banchereau et al., 2012a</xref>) and Zbtb46 (Fig. S4, B and C). This supports their DC identity, and is consistent with their capacity to prime T cells. Contrary to this, human LCs display similar markers to the mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>/CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs, including BTLA and CD24. Although human LCs lacked the expression of XCR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), a marker on a mouse cross-presenting DC subset, they were highly enriched in functional modules shared with the mouse XCR1 populations. This further extenuating the lack of significance in using individual markers as a correlative factors in determining human/mouse analogues. Overall, the expression of XCR1 on dermal CD1a<sup>(dim)</sup>CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs and on dermal CD14<sup>+</sup>, but not on LCs or dermal CD1a<sup>(dim)</sup>CD141<sup>&#x02212;</sup> further suggests that XCR1 may not faithfully mark the cross-presenting DC subset in human.</p><p>Although in blood, CD141 marks a small population of cross-presenting DC subset (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jongbloed et al., 2010</xref>), in human skin, CD141 is detected on multiple populations, including on a small subset of the dermal CD1a<sup>(dim)</sup> DCs and on the dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Haniffa et al., 2012</xref>), but not on LCs. Thus, similar to XCR1, CD141 on its own may not be sufficient to mark a cross-presenting tissue DC subset. Overall, systemic genomic comparison, as we have done for all four human skin DC populations, and ensuing functional comparison is the most reliable approach to determine such homologies.</p><p>Our study shows that LCs are enriched in genes related to the cross-presentation pathway. Interestingly, we found that this set of genes is enriched in the blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs gene transcript, the proposed equivalent to the mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bachem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crozat et al., 2010a</xref>), but not in other examined blood antigen-presenting cells. In a different analysis we showed that blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DC-specific signature is enriched in LCs and not other skin DC subsets. This suggests that CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs, LCs and the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs share a common transcriptional signature associated with cross-presentation. Although human blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs are considered the cross-presenting gold standard and the mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC homologue, Cohn et al., recently showed that receptor mediated delivery of antigen could facilitate cross-presentation in blood CD1c<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cohn et al., 2013</xref>). Because we tested only soluble antigen, we suspect that the cross-presentation signature is required for soluble antigen cross-presentation and not antigen directed into early endosomes. In addition, Segura et al. showed that CD1c<sup>+</sup> DCs isolated from tonsils cross-present as efficiently as tonsil CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Segura et al., 2013</xref>). Taken the differences observed between skin CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs and blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs, we suspect that tissue CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs are different from blood. Overall, CD141 may also not faithfully mark the cross-presenting DC subset across all organs in human.</p><p>In the mouse, early cells of the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC lineage are not initially able to cross-present antigens, rather this capability is induced as a later developmental step via TLR ligation or exposure to GM-CSF. Similarly, it was shown that the capacity of human blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs to cross-present is dependent on TLR ligands such as poly I:C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Haniffa et al., 2012</xref>). In that respect, human blood CD141<sup>+</sup> DCs could represent the equivalent of an earlier CD8&#x003b1; lineage DCs in mice, where additional factors are also needed to induce the ability to cross-present antigens. Human blood-originated dermal CD141<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were reported to require TLR activation for efficient cross-presentation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Haniffa et al., 2012</xref>). The ability to cross-prime antigen to naive T cells without a requirement of a TLR activation is thought to be a unique property of thymic DCs (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dresch et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that LCs display a similar capacity and efficient cross-priming could be demonstrated in the absence of TLR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). This is consistent with our data showing their transcriptional similarity to thymic DCs. Consistent with that, LCs express a very limited set of TLRs as previously reported (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Flacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Klechevsky et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study highlights novel functional similarities between human and mouse DC systems. Most profoundly, between the dermal CD14<sup>+</sup> DCs and the mouse CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and between human epidermal LCs and the mouse XCR1<sup>+</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs. Surprisingly, although mouse and human LCs share some of their markers and their physical location of the epidermis, they differ in their functional module gene expression, which may in fact be more relevant for experimental modules. Overall, our findings demonstrate that human but not mouse LCs are enriched in cross-presentation&#x02013;specific models. Thus, providing further insight as to the role of LCs in human as cross-presenters of soluble antigens and efficient activators of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Isolation of skin DC subsets.</title><p>Human skin specimens were obtained from donors who underwent cosmetic surgeries at Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO) and Barnes Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO) in accordance with Institutional Review Board guidelines.

For the human skin DC dataset, only genes with an average expression value greater than 150 were kept, amounting to 6134 genes. Modules were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). We used Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient as metrics with a power parameter of 12, determined as the power at which scale-free characteristics of the network reached a plateau. Additional parameters were minModuleSize = 100, reassignThreshold = 0.2, mergeCutHeight = 0.1, maxBlockSize = 10,000, deepSplit = 2. Genes with average expression &#x0003e;150 were kept, amounting to 8,059 genes. For module identification, WGCNA algorithm was used with a power parameter of 10.
