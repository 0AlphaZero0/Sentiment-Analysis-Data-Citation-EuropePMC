<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Antiretroviral innate defense genes such as <italic>TRIM5&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>APOBEC3G, BST2</italic>/<italic>Tetherin,</italic> and <italic>SAMHD1</italic> exhibit characteristic evolutionary signatures of powerful selective pressures reflecting a long-standing evolutionary arms race between the host and viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A second common characteristic of these genes is that they are interferon-inducible and differentially expressed during HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, they frequently interact directly with viral proteins, either to exert their antiviral activity or because they are targeted by viral antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, evolutionary and molecular characteristics, such as positive selection in primate genomes, differential expression during infection, and interaction with viral components might constitute a distinct signature of genes endowed with antiviral activity.</p><p>We leveraged the availability of complete genome sequences of several primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, marmoset, tarsier, bushbaby, and mouse lemur) to perform a genome-wide screen for genes carrying the signatures of known host restriction factors. To address this, we examined which human genes that are differentially expressed during HIV-1 infection, and/or encode host factors interacting with viral proteins have also been subject to diversifying selection during primate evolution. Candidates carrying the most promising combined signatures were examined for their effects on different steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. We emphasized the confirmation of the IFN-induced nature of the candidates, their significant expression in HIV-1 target cells, the efficient reduction of infectious virus production in the over-expression screen, and a particular emphasis on genes that affected the infectiousness of HIV-1 more severely than viral gene expression and/or showed some specificity for the LTR promoter. The combination of bioinformatics criteria with a broad functional screen allowed bringing a large data set of genes to a manageable list of candidates for further analyses. Our results demonstrate that over-expression of a surprisingly high proportion of these genes inhibits infectious HIV-1 production and suggest that the viral accessory proteins Vpr, Vpu and/or Nef may diminish the antiviral effect of some of these cellular factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genes that are induced during HIV-1 infection have a distinct evolutionary profile</title><p>To examine the contribution of differences in cellular gene expression to viral control, we have previously generated transcriptome data from CD4+ T cells of untreated HIV-1 infected individuals with different viral loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additional gene expression data were obtained from published sources on lymph nodes during HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We also assessed the evidence for evolutionary pressure on all genes by comparing human gene sequences to those of eight additional simian and prosimian species (see methods) and calculated a gene-wide ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions (gene dN/dS). We found that genes whose expression is positively correlated to viral load in CD4+ T cells (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;180) or induced in lymph nodes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;360) of HIV-1 infected persons had higher dN/dS values than the genome-wide median for primates (CD4+ T cell gene set, dN/dS 0.25 vs 0.18, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, and lymph node gene set dN/dS 0.28 vs 0.18, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Genes with dN/dS values inflated above the genome-wide reference could either be evolving under more neutral selection, or could have within them certain codons evolving under positive selection that bring up the gene-wide dN/dS value. Across these expression datasets, 30 genes up-regulated during HIV-1 infection were under positive selection (dN/dS &#x0003e;1).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Evolutionary pattern of the protein coding genome in primates.

Statistically significant differences (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) were observed for distributions towards greater dN/dS values for genes differentially expressed in CD4+ T cells and lymph nodes during HIV-1 infection, in infection with Dengue virus, <italic>Salmonella typhic</italic> and <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, and for distributions towards smaller dN/dS values for genes involved in HIV-1-human interaction datasets and in the catalog of Mendelian disorders.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12977_2015_165_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>We next examined whether such an evolutionary pattern is also observed in other human infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

A similar pattern was identified for three curated sets of innate immunity genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.innatedb.ca">http://www.innatedb.ca</ext-link>; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1714) that displayed a statistically significant shift to high dN/dS values (all p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Altogether, these results demonstrate that genes associated with infection and immune response show distinctly higher dN/dS values in primates. Although a higher dN/dS value could be indicative of relaxed constraint rather than positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], immune-related genes have consistently been observed to evolve with higher dN/dS values and show evidence for codon-specific positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>We then extended the analysis to genes described in the NCBI HIV-1 protein interaction database (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1251) and in the global landscape of HIV-human protein complexes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;350) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These sets of genes had a significantly lower median dN/dS than the genome-wide median for primates (0.14 and 0.13 vs 0.18, respectively, both <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The shift to conservation is comparable to that of other characteristically conserved genes such as those of the OMIM Mendelian disease database (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1289) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). This most likely reflects the fact that HIV has to interact with numerous well-conserved cellular factors (&#x0201c;HIV dependency factors&#x0201d;) to complete its replication cycle. Although the two HIV interaction datasets were more conserved, 35 genes had dN/dS &#x0003e;1. As indicated below, some genes under positive selection were common to both the expression and the interaction datasets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selection of 30 candidate restriction factors for experimental validation</title><p>Our initial evolutionary scan identified 841 genes (out of a total of 21,389) with a dN/dS ratio&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). We next evaluated in detail the functional profile of this subset by assessing their level of upregulation during HIV-1 infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, and/or evidence for interaction with viral proteins (see Methods) resulting in an initial shortlist of 57 genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). To confidently assess the genes' evolutionary signatures, we used the codon-level analysis package (codeml) in the Phylogenetic Analysis Using Maximum Likelihood (PAML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) software on curated multiple alignments of primate genes (see Methods). This method averages per-codon dN/dS estimates across a gene and assesses the evidence for codon-level selection using maximum likelihood estimation. Of the initial 57 candidates, we selected 30 genes for functional analyses based on significant evidence of positive selection at one or more amino acid sites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Eleven of these 30 candidate genes were chosen because they are upregulated during HIV-1 infection, 14 have been shown to interact with viral proteins, and five fulfill both criteria (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). As a proof-of-principle, <italic>TRIM5&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> were identified in the screen.

To also consider factors displaying only codon-specific positive selection, we additionally performed a second screen and ranking approach that are described below.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Experimental setup of the screen and the different measurements involved. <bold>(A)</bold> In orthogonal screens, 841 human genes were identified to be under positive selection, of which only 30 were retained as candidates (11 were upregulated during HIV-1 infection, 14 reported to interact with viral proteins, and 5 fulfilled both criteria). <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic presentation of the bi-cistronic constructs coexpressing the gene candidate together with the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) under the control of a CMV promoter and the HIV-1 NL4-3-based IRES-eGFP proviral reporter construct.

A total of 27 candidate genes Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 were cloned into a bi-cistronic vector coexpressing the gene of interest and the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Three of the 30 genes (<italic>PARP9, SGOL2, SPAG5</italic>) could not be PCR amplified and cloned from cDNA of primary blood cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with the gene expression constructs and HIV-1 NL4-3-based proviral IRES/eGFP constructs. The latter express Nef and the enhanced version of the green fluorescent protein (eGFP) from the same viral RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, the green fluorescence intensity is an indicator of early viral gene expression. To identify possible antagonistic effects of the viral Vpr, Vpu and Nef proteins on the candidate gene products, we screened them for inhibition of a wild-type (wt) NL4-3-based HIV-1 construct and an otherwise isogenic derivate thereof (named &#x00394;3) containing defects in these three accessory genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The effect of candidate genes on early LTR-driven gene expression was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at 36 to 48&#x000a0;hours post-transfection (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). To monitor the expression of late viral gene products, virus release and infectivity of progeny virions, we assessed the quantity of cell-associated and cell-free p24 capsid antigen and the infectivity of the viral supernatants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). The FACS-based assay allowed us to readily determine the percentage of cells expressing the proviral HIV-1 genome and the cellular candidate genes both alone and in combination (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Importantly, none of the 27 candidate genes caused significant cytotoxic effects or reduced the metabolic activity of the cells under the experimental conditions used to determine their antiviral activity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>A high proportion of candidate genes display anti-HIV-1 activity</title><p>We found that most candidate genes reduced the frequency of HIV-1-expressing (eGFP+) cells, on average by about 30% (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

To better dissect the general agreement between <italic>in vivo</italic> data with actual interferon inducibility, we assessed the response of primary CD4+ T cells from healthy donors to stimulation with interferon alpha, interferon gamma and to cell activation via the T cell receptor (TCR). The analysis identified a general agreement between <italic>in vivo</italic> data and interferon alpha gene induction, with the majority of the genes being strongly up-regulated by stimulation (in healthy donors) and by viral replication in HIV+ patients (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

Use of this global gene metric is a useful link to previous literature; however, tools such as PAML that assess local signatures of selective pressure and have built-in statistics are becoming a preferred approach. In particular, genes of some known restriction factors (e.g. <italic>BST2</italic> and <italic>SAMHD1</italic>) just show signatures of codon-specific (local) instead of global positive section pressure. Thus, we explored a second genome-wide approach to rank genes using several metrics based on characteristics of innate immunity genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We initially considered eight parameters associated with innate immunity genes: dN/dS value, codon-specific positive selection (PAML), measurements of cross species adaptive evolution, burden of synonymous, missense and non-sense variation, intolerance to functional variation and number of paralogs, as well as the <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression response to HIV-1 infection. We trained a model using the set of known HIV restriction factors (<italic>APOBEC3G, BST2/Tetherin, MX2, SAMHD1 and TRIM5&#x003b1;</italic>). Gene parameters were iteratively included/excluded, and the final set of parameters was selected such that the sum of the ranks across the known genes was minimized (see Methods). We present in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2 the top 200 ranked genes.

Overall, 20 of the 30 candidates identified in the initial screen also ranked above the 95 percentile for the genome in the second approach, and all but one (<italic>TNFRSF10D</italic>) ranked above the 75 percentile.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we utilized features of known antiviral host restriction factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], such as evolutionary signatures of positive selection, expression during HIV infection, and interaction with viral proteins, to identify novel cellular factors that inhibit HIV-1. Initially, we performed a canonical genome-wide screen revealing that only a small proportion of the genome (841 of 21389 genes; 3.9%) shows evidence for positive selection in primates (dN/dS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1). Next, we examined which of these genes are significantly upregulated during HIV-1 infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and/or encode for cellular factors known to interact with HIV-1 proteins. Based on these selection criteria 30 candidate genes were selected for closer examination and a strikingly high proportion of them suppressed infectious HIV-1 production in transfected 293T cells. To consider the fact that known restriction factors, such as APOBEC3G, BST2 and SAMHD1, show site-specific rather than global evidence for positive selection, we conducted a second screen with more flexible modeling on features of known HIV restriction factors to rank genes without imposing strict thresholds for calling a candidate. All five known restriction factors (APOBEC3G, TRIM5&#x003b1;, MX2, SAMHD1 and BST2) ranked within the top 2.5% of all protein-coding genes examined (average 1.0%). The analysis extends previous work from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and work of Meyerson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that searched for signatures of positive selection among previously described HIV host factor genes. The current genome-wide analyses allowed identification of additional genes sharing characteristics of known restriction factors, a useful basis for the identification of novel intrinsic antiretroviral cellular factors.</p><p>To evaluate possible antiviral effects of the selected genes, we determined their impact on HIV-1 gene expression, virus production and viral infectivity. A set of 27 genes encoding cellular proteins not previously implicated as HIV-1 restriction factors were amplified from primary human blood cells and cloned into a bi-cistronic vector coexpressing the gene candidate BFP. Over-expression of a striking proportion of candidate genes (16 of 27; 59%) reduced the production of infectious wt HIV-1 particles by more than 75% without causing cytotoxic effects and this number was even higher in the absence of intact <italic>vpr</italic>, <italic>vpu</italic> and <italic>nef</italic> genes (20 of 27; 74%). For example, genes of the apolipoprotein L gene family (<italic>APOL1, APOL3, APOL6</italic>) were generally very potent inhibitors. All members of this gene family have rapidly evolved in primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and APOL1 has been shown to confer immunity to <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> that can be countered by a trypanosome-encoded antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Members of the TNF-receptor superfamily (<italic>TNFRSF10A</italic> and <italic>10D</italic>) were also powerful inhibitors. Notably, <italic>TNFRSF10A</italic> was also identified as one of the most potent anti-HIV-1 factors among 380 type I interferon-stimulated genes in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another potent inhibitor of HIV-1 was <italic>CD164</italic> (also known as endolyn) a cell adhesion molecule that interacts with CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the high activity of <italic>OAS1</italic> is noteworthy because this interferon-induced factor is known to generate 2',5'-oligoadenylates which activate RNase L thus causing viral RNA degradation and inhibition of viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Notably, <italic>OAS1</italic> affected the percentage of HIV-1 infected (eGFP+) cells less severely than the mean fluorescence intensity of eGFP expression, which would be expected in the case of RNase L mediated viral RNA degradation. A similar phenotype was observed for <italic>IFI16</italic>, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and plays a role in the sensing of intracellular viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More recently, IFI16 has been reported as a key player in inducing pyroptosis in abortively infected quiescent CD4+ T cells, thereby contributing to the massive depletion of CD4+ T cells observed during HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggest that restriction factors, such as TRIM5&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and BST2/tetherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] may also act as immune sensors and direct anti-HIV effects of IFI16 warrant further study. Conversely, some genes that displayed anti-HIV activity are known to be involved in signaling, both in various cancers (<italic>CD164, TNFRSF10A/D, ZWINT, MT1X, IL3</italic>) and immune or T cell activation (<italic>GBP5, CD1A</italic>). Thus, these genes may not inhibit HIV-1 directly but could also induce cellular responses associated with the expression of other innate immunity factors. This possibility is in agreement with our observation that some candidate factors inhibited various viral promoters. It is also noteworthy, however, that 293T cells lack many intact immune signaling pathways and did not express detectable levels of interferon after transfection with constructs expressing the various candidate factors. Further studies will be necessary to clearly distinguish between direct and indirect anti-HIV effects.</p><p>Two of the 27 cellular genes examined (<italic>SP110</italic> and <italic>IL1A</italic>) enhanced production of infectious HIV-1. <italic>SP110</italic> is part of a leukocyte-specific nuclear body component that may also play a role in the regulation of gene transcription. Mutations in <italic>SP110</italic> are associated with immunodeficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has been reported that this factor stabilizes EBV mRNAs and enhances lytic viral gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The strongest enhancing effects on infectious virus production (up to 7-fold in dose-dependency studies) were observed for <italic>IL1A</italic>. This cytokine plays a key role in inflammation and the regulation of the immune response. It has been reported that HIV-1-exposed seronegative sex workers show reduced levels of <italic>IL1A</italic> expression in their genital mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, the present results confirm and expand previous data supporting that these cellular factors may enhance viral infection and clearly warrant further investigation.</p><p>In most cases, the effect of the candidate restriction genes in the FACS-based assays, intra- and extracellular p24 levels and infectious virus production correlated with one another, suggesting that reduced viral gene expression and/or translation are responsible for the inhibitory activity of the cellular factors rather than effects on virus release or virion infectivity. In support of this, preliminary data using LTR-luciferase reporter constructs suggest that many candidates suppress LTR activity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Nonetheless, our results also provide evidence that some candidate genes target different steps of the viral life cycle. For example, the guanylate-binding protein 5 (<italic>GBP5</italic>) and the mucin-like factor <italic>SPN</italic> (also known as leukosialin, sialophorin or CD43) reduced viral infectivity more severely than the levels of cell-free p24 antigen and may thus specifically reduce virion infectivity<italic>.</italic><italic>GBP5</italic> is a member of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases, which have been implicated in protection against various pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Another factor (<italic>IFITM3</italic>), that was identified by our screen and reduced infectious virus production, was recently shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions and to impair their infectiousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. <italic>SPN</italic> regulates CD4+ T cell proliferation and migration and shows reduced expression and aberrant glycosylation in HIV-1-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thus, it is conceivable that <italic>GBP5, SPN</italic> and <italic>IFITM3</italic> may affect virion infectivity although the underlying molecular mechanisms of the former two remain to be determined.</p><p>Some known host restriction factors, i.e. APOBEC3G, Tetherin and SAMHD1, were initially discovered because they are counteracted by viral accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We found that the absence of intact <italic>vpr</italic>, <italic>vpu</italic> and <italic>nef</italic> genes increased the inhibitory effects of several candidate factors (e.g. <italic>APOL1</italic>, <italic>APOL6, CD164, GBP5, SPN, CD3E, ZWINT</italic> and <italic>PIP</italic>) on p24 and infectious virus production. However, the differences were generally modest because even wt HIV-1 was efficiently inhibited at high expression levels of the candidates. Notably, over-expression of known restriction factors, such as tetherin, can also overcome the viral antagonists. Thus, it remains to be clarified whether the lower intrinsic infectiousness of the &#x00394;3 HIV-1 construct compared to the wt virus or specific antagonistic effects of the accessory Vpr, Vpu and/or Nef are responsible for the observed differences in susceptibility to inhibition by some candidate factors.</p><p>Not all recognized restriction factors would have been identified under the criteria of the evolutionary genetic screen because of the criteria that imposed a dN/dS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1. We could however demonstrate that alternative approaches that model several characteristics of innate immunity genes ranked all known restriction factors and most of the novel candidates among the top 5% genes in the genome. Overall, genes that emerged from the screen were strongly induced by interferon alpha. These results indicate that they are <italic>bona fide</italic> interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are possibly endowed with antiviral activity. Our ongoing studies aim to further define the antiviral mechanisms of the most potent and specific candidate genes as well as their possible interaction with the accessory viral proteins.</p><p>In summary, we show that the number of cellular genes showing evolutionary and functional characteristics similar to known host restriction factors is limited. Interferon treatment induced expression of most of these genes in CD4+ T cells and over-expression of a strikingly high proportion of them in transfected 293T cells inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1. These results are consistent with the observation that interferon administration, likely through the action of yet to be characterized interferon stimulated genes, inhibits HIV and related primate lentiviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms and the relevance of these potential restriction factors to the control of HIV-1 replication in relevant viral target cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> remain elusive and further characterization of these genes may improve our understanding of cellular defense mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Expression and protein interaction datasets</title><p>We used transcriptome data from purified CD4+ T cells from 128 HIV-1 infected seroconverting individuals representing the complete range of viral setpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] using Illumina Human HT-12&#x000a0;V3 BeadChip arrays (Illumina).

Comparison between Compara&#x02019;s protein-based alignments and its DNA-based alignments showed that the protein-based alignments often contained missing or alternatively-spliced exons in otherwise highly similar primate orthologs, leading to stretches of erroneously-aligned bases and inflated estimates of evolutionary rates and dN/dS (data not shown). In order to avoid such errors, we gathered human-flattened genomic alignments by using exon coordinates from the human Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) transcript, or if no CCDS transcript was available, the longest human protein-coding transcript, to extract all available aligned primate DNA sequences from the &#x02018;12 eutherian mammals&#x02019; DNA-based multiple genomic alignments from Ensembl's Enredo-Pecan-Ortheus pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

HIV-1 NL4-3 Tat was cloned into a pCG expression vector via XbaI/MluI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>RNAseq Analysis</title><p>Resting CD4+ T cells were purified from two healthy blood donors by Ficoll gradient separation followed by negative selection and magnetic separation using the human CD4+ T Cell enrichment kit supplemented with anti-HLA-DR, anti-CD25 and anti-CD69 (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells (10<sup>6</sup>) were incubated for 24&#x000a0;hours, either with medium only, or with 100 or 1000&#x000a0;IU/ml interferon &#x003b1; (Roferon-A, Roche) or interferon &#x003b3; (R&#x00026;D Systems), or with 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g anti-CD3/1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g anti-CD28 and 100 U/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (R&#x00026;D Systems) to mimic TCR stimulation. After 24&#x000a0;hour incubation, total RNA extraction was performed using Illustra RNAspin mini isolation kit (GE Healthcare) and further processed for mRNA-Seq library preparation (TruSeq RNA sample prep kit, Illumina). 100&#x000a0;bp paired-end sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000. About 140 mio read pairs were obtained for the samples. Sequencing reads were quality filtered before alignment using Cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and PrInseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Cleaned sequencing reads were aligned to a build genome using SOAPsplice. Gene expression was assessed by determining the number of mapped reads per gene using HTSeq-count tool, followed by DESeq R package normalization. An additional normalization step taking into account the gene coding length was performed so that the resulting counts could be compared across samples for a given gene, and also between genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Ranking screen</title><p>A set of 15,052 protein-coding genes was annotated with nine parameters informative for response to HIV-1 infection or evolutionary history. Parameters included <italic>in vivo</italic> response to HIV-1 infection (i.e. expression correlation with viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], primate dN/dS value, codon-specific positive selection (PAML), measurements of cross species adaptive evolution (the McDonald-Kreitman value comparing human sequence to chimp, orangutan or rhesus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], burden of synonymous, missense and non-sense variation, intolerance to functional variation (rare variant intolerance score obtained from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]) and number of paralogs. Burden of synonymous, missense and non-sense variation was taken from exome sequence data on ~6,300 individuals sequenced as part of the NHLBI exome sequencing project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>). Burden was calculated per gene as the total number of variants in each class divided by gene length. Genes were ranked for each parameter (with top ranked genes showing high positive correlation with HIV viral load and high levels of within and between species diversity) and the ranks were summed giving equal weight to each measurement. Beginning with all measurements, parameters were iteratively dropped and re-included (individually and in combination) in the ranking and the final model was selected based on the set of parameters that optimized the ranking of known HIV-1 restriction factors. The final set of parameters included <italic>in vivo</italic> response to HIV-1 infection, dN/dS value and evidence for codon-specific positive selection (PAML P-value).</p></sec></sec>
