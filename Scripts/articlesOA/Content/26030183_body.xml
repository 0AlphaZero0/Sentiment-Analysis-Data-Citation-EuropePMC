<sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ability of microbial pathogens to trigger immune responses which counteract host defense is critical for the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Among such pathways, the induction of IL-10 represents a key mechanism by which microbes suppress host antimicrobial responses. In some circumstances, the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) by the pathogen represents one trigger for IL-10 production, resulting in a profound inhibitory effect on innate and adaptive immunity. As such, the induction of the type I IFN to IL-10 pathway contributes to chronic progressive disease in bacterial (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and viral (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Teijaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) infections. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which IL-10 is induced in human immune responses is central for understanding how microbial pathogens suppress antimicrobial defense strategies.</p><p id="P3">Leprosy, a human infectious disease of skin caused by the intracellular bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, presents as a spectrum in which the clinical manifestations correlate with the immune response to the pathogen. As such, leprosy is a valuable model for investigating human immune responses to infection. In the skin lesions of leprosy patients, an inverse correlation exists between the expression of IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3;, as well as their respective downstream gene programs (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The skin lesions from patients with the progressive, L-lep form of leprosy display an IFN-&#x003b2; gene signature, whereas lesions from patients with the localized, T-lep form of leprosy are characterized by a low IFN-&#x003b2; and high IFN-&#x003b3; gene signature. Similarly, IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 expression in lesions were significantly correlated, which led to the observation that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induction of IL-10 was type I IFN dependent. Both IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 inhibit the antimicrobial effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on intracellular <italic>M. leprae</italic>, identifying the IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 axis as a key immunosuppressive pathway in human mycobacterial infection.</p><p id="P4">The ability of IFN-&#x003b2; to induce IL-10 is relevant to the pathogenesis of other microbial infections. For example, overlap of the IFN-&#x003b2; gene signature in leprosy lesions with the IFN-&#x003b2; signatures from peripheral blood cells in tuberculosis patients (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Berry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), identified a common signature of 16 IFN-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced genes (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). One of these IFN-&#x003b2; downstream genes, IL-27, has been shown to induce IL-10, leading to the suppression of lymphocyte responses (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Murugaiyan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). IL-27 functions as a heterodimer composed of two subunits: p28 and EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3), of which the transcriptional regulation of IL-27p28 has been studied in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The IL-27 heterodimer activates via an IL-27R complex consisting of the unique subunit IL-27R (also referred to a TCCR and WSX-1) and the gp130 chain of IL-6R. Here, we investigated the role of IL-27 in suppressing human host defense responses against a cutaneous pathogen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27 in human monocytes</title><p id="P5">To begin evaluating the role of IL-27 in the IFN-&#x003b2; downstream network, we first examined whether IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27 expression in adherent monocytes using an ELISA that measures the levels of the IL-27 heterodimer. Indeed, IFN-&#x003b2; significantly induced IL-27 in human monocytes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).

In addition to the T-lep and L-lep forms of leprosy, we examined reversal reactions (RR), representing a shift from the L-lep to T-lep part of the disease spectrum, accompanied by a reduction in bacilli in lesions and enhanced Th1 cytokine responses (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). IL-27p28 but not IL-27 EBI3 mRNAs, was found to be differentially expressed in L-lep compared to T-lep lesions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). RR lesions expressed IL-27p28 mRNA at levels similar to T-lep lesions, and greater than in L-lep lesions. However, IL-27 EBI3 mRNA expression was greater in RR lesions compared to both L-lep and T-lep lesions, though this increase was not significant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The expression levels of IL-27p28, but not IL-27 EBI3, directly correlated with IL-10 in the microarray data (r=0.71 and r=0.00959 respectively, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). The elevated expression of IL-27p28 transcripts in L-lep vs. T-lep and RR lesions and correlation with IL-10 mRNA expression was corroborated by PCR of an independent set of skin biopsy specimens (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e and f</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The distribution and localization of IL-27 protein in leprosy lesions was examined by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy using a mAb that recognized the IL-27 heterodimer. Similar to IL-27p28 mRNA, IL-27 protein was also more highly expressed in L-lep lesions compared to T-lep and RR lesions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, IL-27 protein colocalized with CD209<sup>+</sup> and CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages, of relevance since these markers identify the predominant macrophage phenotype in L-lep lesions and is reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic> by the differentiation of monocytes by IL-10 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Montoya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition, some IL-27 was detected in CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Triple immunofluorescence revealed that IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-27 and IL-10 are co-expressed at the cellular level in L-lep lesions, with some cells also expressing individual cytokines, indicating autocrine and paracrine production of the three cytokines (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Taken together, the immunohistology data indicate that IL-27, along with IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10, are most strongly expressed in L-lep lesions, therefore associated with the progressive form of leprosy.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>IL-27 prevents IFN-&#x003b3; dependent antimicrobial activity against M. leprae in human monocytes</title><p id="P10">Next, the effect of IL-27 on IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic> was evaluated.

Because the experiments are performed over a five day period, we could not assess whether IFN-&#x003b2; inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity was IL-27 dependent, as knockdown of IL-27 using siRNA is transient.

Here, we explored the role of IL-27 in the immune response to a microbial pathogen by studying leprosy as a model. We provide evidence that IL-27 inhibits host defense in human leprosy as: i) the induction of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 by both IFN-&#x003b2; and <italic>M. leprae</italic> was partially dependent on IL-27, ii) IL-27 colocalized with IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in the skin lesions from the progressive L-lep form vs. the self-limited T-lep of leprosy; and iii) IL-27 suppressed IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic>. Together, these data reveal that the induction of IL-27 provides a mechanism for suppression of host defense responses in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous human infectious disease, leprosy.</p><p id="P12">Through the analysis of gene expression profiles in leprosy, we identified IL-27, specifically the p28 subunit, as an IFN-&#x003b2; downstream gene associated with the progressive form of the disease (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Waddell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). IL-27 was part of a common set of 16 IFN-&#x003b2; downstream genes in the overlap between the gene expression profiles derived from the skin lesions of L-lep patients and the peripheral blood from two cohorts of patients with active tuberculosis (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Berry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

We provide evidence that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces each of these cytokines, as well as demonstrate that these cytokines in turn induce the downstream pathway, i.e. IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27 and IL-10, and IL-27 induces IL-10 directly. Our finding that IL-27 induces IL-10 in human monocytes is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that IL-27 induces IL-10 in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Iyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and human T cells (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Batten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The ability of <italic>M. leprae</italic> and IFN-&#x003b2; to induce IL-10 was partially dependent on the expression of IL-27.

In our study, the ability of <italic>M. leprae</italic> and IFN-&#x003b2; to induce IL-10 was partially blocked by IL-27 knockdown. The induction of IL-10 by the co-addition of live <italic>M. tuberculosi</italic>s and IFN-&#x003b2; to mouse bone marrow derived macrophages was not inhibited by IL-27R deficiency. Live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is known to induce IL-10 via TLR2 signaling (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), a TLR pathway that does not involve induction of type I IFN. Further studies demonstrate that engagement of TLRs can directly induce IL-10 in macrophages (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Nair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), as can engagement of DC-SIGN through Raf-1 kinase (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Gringhuis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The role of IL-27 in triggering IL-10 production in mycobacterial infection suggests that it might be considered as a therapeutic target.

Therefore, neutralization of IL-27 may favor IFN-&#x003b3; responses which contribute to host defense against mycobacterial infection. As IFN-&#x003b2; may also activate immune responses such as IL-12 induction (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bohnenkamp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), blockade of IL-27 may inhibit the immunosuppressive pathway induced by IFN-&#x003b2; while preserving its immunostimulatory function.

Monocytes were isolated as described above, pre-treated with IFN-&#x003b3; (273U/ml) for 24 hrs and infected overnight with <italic>M. leprae</italic> at an MOI of 10:1 followed by stimulation with IFN-&#x003b2; (200U/ml), IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-10 (10ng/ml), IL-27 (40ng/ml) or medium for three days. Total RNA and DNA were isolated as previously described (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA as described (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) for both human and bacterial mRNAs. The bacterial 16S rRNA and genomic element DNA (RLEP) levels were then assessed using real time PCR. In order to normalize for the total monocytes present in the culture, 36B4 was also evaluated. Comparison of the bacterial DNA to the mammalian 36B4 levels was used to monitor infectivity between all the conditions in the assay as well as PCR quality. The 16S rRNA and genomic DNA values were calculated using the &#x00394;&#x00394;CT analysis, with the bacterial DNA value serving as the housekeeping gene. The <italic>M. leprae</italic> 16S rRNA and <italic>M. leprae</italic> repetitive genomic element (RLEP) primers used were as previously described (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Martinez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>ELISA</title><p id="P29">Secreted IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-10 and IL-27 proteins in the supernatant were measured using VeriKine<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Human Interferon-Beta ELISA Kit (PBL Interferon Source), IL-10 (Invitrogen), IL-27 Duoset ELISA (R&#x00026;D system) following manufacturer protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Primary cell siRNA transfection</title><p id="P30">siRNA transfection into primary human PBMCs was accomplished using the Amaxa Nucleofection System and the Human Monocyte Kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations.

Transfection efficiency of siRNA into primary monocytes was assessed using siGLO, a fluorescently labeled control oligo (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Cells were allowed to rest for 18h following transfection before stimulation. At the time of stimulation, non-adherent cells were removed and fresh media was added.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P31">Results are reported as pooled data from an entire series of experiments, and described as mean &#x000b1; the SEM unless otherwise indicated.
