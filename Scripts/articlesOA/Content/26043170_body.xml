Only 175 annotated transcripts were present in both comparisons and these did not relate to any GO enrichment, indicating that the differential gene expression post-treatment might not be a residual disease signature.</p><p id="P16">To further understand the biological processes associated with the differentially expressed genes between the two groups post-treatment, a pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Ingenuity canonical pathway analysis revealed high enrichment in general metabolic processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In accordance, analysis of all patients combined showed that the abundances of 51 compounds were significantly different between the pre- and post-treatment time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). However, <italic>Maf</italic>-infected patients showed less pronounced differences than <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected patients between pre- and post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Only intra-group correlations between peripheral blood metabolites and gene expression were considered so as to remove the effect of the inter-group correlations. We fitted a linear regression model for each of the data with the groups (pre- and post-treatment) as the predictor, and used the residuals from these models to calculate Spearman rank correlation coefficients. We found that among the 21 strongest correlations (with correlation coefficient rho &#x0003e; 0.65), 8 corresponded to correlations between particular genes and the metabolite arabinose, which was present at significantly higher levels in patients from the pre-treatment group. Also, 4 of the strongest correlations were between X- or Y-chromosome-linked genes and steroid hormones. To obtain a better understanding of the biological link between arabinose and gene expression profiles, we performed GO enrichment analysis (using GOrilla) of genes sorted according to their absolute correlation with arabinose.

Discovery and exploitation of MTBC lineages-specific host biomarkers could further our understanding of TB pathogenesis as well as improve diagnosis, treatment or vaccine development for TB. Peripheral blood gene expression profiles were not different between <italic>Maf</italic>- and <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected patients pre-treatment but differed significantly post-treatment, and these were predominantly associated with immune responses and metabolic diseases. Intriguingly, the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4&#x003b1;) regulated about 15% of the genes differentially expressed between the groups post-treatment. The serum metabolic profiles were similar between <italic>Maf</italic>- and <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected patients both pre- and post-treatment, but significantly different between pre- and post-treatment, particularly in <italic>Mtb</italic>- than in <italic>Maf</italic>-infected groups.</p><p id="P20">Although both groups had very similar clinical presentations at baseline and no significant interaction between treatment and lineages was found, the machine learning models performed better for <italic>Mtb</italic> samples than <italic>Maf</italic> samples, suggesting that a better clinical resolution of the disease was achieved for <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected groups. The similarity in peripheral blood transcriptomic and metabolic profiles before treatment suggests uniformity in host responses after succumbing to infection, irrespective of the infecting lineage of MTBC. This is also supported by the similar clinical scores and activated T cells proportions between the groups previously described before start of treatment.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Differences observed after completing 6-month treatment could reflect differences in the mycobacterial lineage response to anti-TB drugs and/or host immune response for recovery. <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Although we did not identify a strong association or enrichment of inflammatory response-related genes, clinical data suggest slower recovery in <italic>Maf</italic>-infected patients. The poor resolution of CXR, and higher proportion of activated T cells<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> following completion of anti-TB treatment in <italic>Maf</italic>-infected patients likely indicate persistence of the bacilli, possibly due to lower <italic>in-vivo</italic> drug sensitivity or inability of the host anti-TB immune response to have resolved within this period post-treatment or persistence of the bacilli in <italic>Maf</italic>-patients. The similarity of the peripheral blood cell counts between the two groups both pre- and post-treatment, suggesting that differences in transcriptomic and metabolic profiles might be functional rather than structural support that it takes longer time for the inflammatory responses in <italic>Maf</italic> to resolve.</p><p id="P21">HNF4&#x003b1; is a highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily expressed in liver, kidney, intestine and pancreas of mammals,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and was found to regulate about 15% of the genes differentially expressed between the groups post-treatment in this study.

Serum tryptophan concentration has been shown to be lower in active TB patients compared to treated patients and healthy controls, and has been suggested as a prognostic marker for pulmonary TB.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Tryptophan is actively degraded into kynurenine by indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, which is induced by the bacteria during active TB,<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> thereby driving an increase in kynurenine abundance with a reverse scenario in healthy individuals.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> However, no differences were detected in kynurenine concentration post-treatment in either group probably because kynurenine metabolism constitutes only a small part of tryptophan catabolism.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In contrast to the transcriptomic data, the metabolic profiles did not show any significant differences between the two groups post-treatment or any significant interactions between treatment (pre and post) and bacterial lineage.</p><p id="P23">The concentration of serum arabinose, a pro-inflammatory molecule, which significantly decreased in <italic>Mtb</italic> compared to <italic>Maf</italic> patients following treatment, showed higher correlation with genes associated with host defense.
