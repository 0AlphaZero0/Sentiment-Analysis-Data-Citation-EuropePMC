<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec004"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis is one of the most common causes of death from infectious diseases. Studies have shown that one-third of the world&#x02019;s population is infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> (MTB). The people who are infected with MTB but who do not have active tuberculosis have latent infection (LTBI), and they have a 10% lifetime chance that they will progress to having the active disease.</p><p>Macrophages play a key role in the immune defence, and in particular, early clearance of MTB. MTB invade and replicate within alveolar macrophages. They evade the host defence system by blocking the formation of the apoptotic envelope [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or inhibiting plasma membrane repair [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which lead to macrophage necrosis and dissemination of infection in the lung.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that have an important regulatory role in gene expression programs [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Each miRNA has the potential to repress the expression of hundreds of genes [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Disease-associated miRNAs represent a new class of diagnostic marker or therapeutic targets [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several of these have recently been demonstrated to regulate the components of important inflammation signalling pathways under the challenge of specific MTB antigens [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, miR-144* were over-expressed in the T cells of active TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], miR-146a regulating IL-6 production in dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. High miR-125b expression and low miR-155 expression with correspondingly low TNF production regulate the macrophage inflammatory response [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while the miR-155/miR-155* ratio was increased in PBMCs of MTB patients [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The effect of miRNA expression on the infection of various MTB strain types is as yet unknown. While most studies used laboratory strains, clinical strains such as that of the Beijing/W family have been associated with outbreaks and multidrug resistance, and may harbour a genetic advantage for disease. We hypothesized that miRNAs have a role in regulating the unique gene expression of macrophages in a strain- and host-dependent way. In this study, we examined the expression of 384 unique human-specific and widely expressed miRNAs from PMA-treated THP-1 derived macrophages infected with different clinical MTB strains. The results revealed unique signatures that differentiated infections of Beijing/W from non-Beijing/W strains. In addition, we also revealed that differentially expressed miRNA profiles of macrophages of patients with active MTB infection differed from those of LTBI patients and healthy controls. Pathway analyses suggested that cell membrane and extracellular matrix metabolite involve glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis; and that immune-regulatory interactions involving TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway take part in the dysregulation of critical TB processes in the macrophages. These miRNAs profiles may serve as disease-associated markers and enhance our understanding in the host-bacterial interactions in MTB infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Bacterial Strains</title><p>Twelve clinical isolates of MTB, including six Beijing/W, six non-Beijing/W strains previously isolated from patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong were examined.

[<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, DTM-PCR used three primers in a multiplex PCR to target the RD105 deletion in Beijing/W genotypes and produced a 1,466 bp product for the non-Beijing genotype and a 761 bp for the Beijing/W genotype.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Patient recruitment and characteristics</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. All participants were older than 18 years and gave written informed consent. Patients who were pregnant, immune-suppressed, or who had diabetes or autoimmune disease were excluded. From each individual in the three cohorts: the healthy (n = 3), the latent (n = 4), and the active TB patients (n = 3), whole blood specimens were collected for monocytes isolation. Patients with active TB were confirmed by a positive acid-fast smear and culture. Active TB patients were prospectively recruited and sampled before any anti-mycobacterial treatment was started. LTBI cases were identified to be positive in the IFN-&#x003b3; release assay (IGRA) but without their having signs and symptoms of active disease.

The Beijing strains showed increased transmission fitness when they acquired streptomycin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

We showed for the first time that the Beijing/W strains repressed a number of miRNAs as compared to the non-Beijing/W TB strains, which might reflect their virulence characteristics in altering the host response. Hsa-miR485-3p was found to be upregulated in Beijing/W infected macrophages. Hsa-miR-485-3p has been shown to be involved in cell survival [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and knockdown of this miRNA in hepatic cells increased apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Previous studies that have utilized such microarrays as diagnostic markers are listed in <xref rid="pone.0126018.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Studies used whole-genome transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or whole blood cells [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found that FcGR1B (CD64) and Fc gamma receptor 1B (FCGRIB) were the most differentially expressed genes in the individuals with active TB. A recent report found a dominant TNF-a+ MTB&#x02013;specific CD4+ T cell response that discriminated between LTBI and active disease [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

These data may shed some light to the roles of miRNAs in MTB infections, but do not yet explain the transition of latency to active TB disease. We were able to distinguish with the expression of 11-miRNA signature profiles of the active TB group from that of the LTBI group but not that of latent and healthy groups. When we carried out the analysis using group-wise comparisons, the variations between individual group members showed that 10&#x02013;25% of the latent patients remained clustered with the active TB patients, and this corroborated with a previous study which concluded that the whole-blood transcript dominated by neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible genes correlated with the radiological

The miRNA-146 family was found to play key roles in the anti-inflammatory reaction. miR-146b could be induced by LPS or PG from bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. miR-146a/b was a negative regulator of constitutive NF-kB activity, which results in the suppression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 protein levels [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

Additionally, miR-21 also promoted dendritic cell (DC) apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2.

The well-known targets for miR-150 are NOTCH3 (a member of the Notch receptor family) and c-Myb (a transcription factor that plays an essential role in the hematopoietic process that plays important roles both in T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis). In our study, the Beijing/W clinical strains suppressed the miR-150 and miR-21expression and they may play a role in virulence. Lower expression of miR-150 in the active TB patients compared with the latent and healthy controls may be due to the reduced mature T cells and B cells in patients with active TB, as previous studies have shown [<xref rid="pone.0126018.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Both miR-150 and miR-140-3p were differentially expressed in macrophages infected in vitro and those from active TB patients. These two miRNAs are related with the secondary signal transduction pathway, which and likely involved in MTB infection.

Differentially expressed miRNAs and their transcriptional targets might potentially affect the regulation of multiple biological networks. Pathway analysis of our expression profile determined different transcripts that were modified by these miRNAs. These results provide clues for the identification of transcriptionally regulated mechanisms of key biological processes in TB, enhance our understanding of the fundamental biology of MTB, and offer leads for new diagnostics in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126018.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Clustering analysis of the 16 miRNAs was performed using DataAssist 3.0v based on &#x00394;Ct-values of the TLDA results.</title><p>Upregulated miRNAs are designated by various shades of red and down-regulated miRNAs by various shades of green.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126018.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126018.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>miRNA expression levels in human macrophages with LTBI, active MTB disease and in healthy controls.</title><p>Statistical analysis between two groups was performed using the unpaired t-test.
