<sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Over the past two decades, inbred laboratory mice have been used to identify important host responses to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. However, studies using inbred mice might not generalize to all mice or to all humans. Benefits of using a diverse experimental population are the reduction of erroneous interpretations due to strain-specific effects and the detection of new phenotypes that are not present in standard inbred laboratory strains (<xref rid="DMM020867C85" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2007</xref><xref rid="DMM020867C86" ref-type="bibr">, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we have started using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice as another tool to understand susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The genetic diversity of the DO population is on par with that of the human population, and the DO genomes are suited for high-resolution genetic mapping. For these reasons, DO mice have been used to identify novel genetic associations with a variety of traits (<xref rid="DMM020867C28" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C15" ref-type="bibr">Churchill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C74" ref-type="bibr">Svenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C23" ref-type="bibr">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C49" ref-type="bibr">Logan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C67" ref-type="bibr">Recla et al., 2014</xref>), but they have not yet been used extensively as a model of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>Heterogeneity in the DO population is due to eight distinctive founder strains that were chosen for maximal genetic diversity. Five founder strains are inbred laboratory strains and three are wild-derived strains (<xref rid="DMM020867C15" ref-type="bibr">Churchill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C74" ref-type="bibr">Svenson et al., 2012</xref>). Only three of the eight founder strains (C57BL/6, 129 and A/J) have been used in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> research, primarily used to identify requirements for TH1-mediated immunological resistance and to provide some insight into susceptibility (<xref rid="DMM020867C53" ref-type="bibr">Medina and North, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C35" ref-type="bibr">Jagannath et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C14" ref-type="bibr">Chackerian and Behar, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C4" ref-type="bibr">Beamer and Turner, 2005</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of the other five founder strains (NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) has not yet been reported. To our knowledge, DO mice have been used in only one <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection study (<xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>) and one aging study (<xref rid="DMM020867C29" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, additional work is needed. Here, we infected DO mice with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by aerosol and evaluated morbidity, bacterial burden and a set of immunological and inflammatory molecules in lungs, antigen-stimulated blood cultures and plasma. Multiple methods (simple and complex statistical analyses, and machine learning) were used to identify and rank important molecular features. The features were then used to generate tree classification models to discriminate disease status using only molecular biomarkers. Finally, tree classification models were tested using data from a completely independent experiment.</p><p>Decades of research show a complex host response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, involving many cell types, molecules and signaling pathways. Resistance to mycobacterial infection in humans, and to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in mice, requires TH1 polarized cell-mediated immunity, including the cytokines IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-12, TNF and IL-2. Additionally, tuberculosis (TB) disease might be accelerated by the immune suppressive cytokine IL-10. When absent or blocked, these cytokines alter the survival of mice, indicating that their presence is important for outcome (<xref rid="DMM020867C25" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C24" ref-type="bibr">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C79" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C5" ref-type="bibr">Beamer et al., 2008a</xref>,<xref rid="DMM020867C6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C16" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C30" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C88" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).

<boxed-text id="tib" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT</title></caption><p><bold>Clinical issue</bold></p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, which typically affects the lungs. Most infections remain latent, and only about 10% of infected individuals develop active TB, which, if left untreated, can be fatal. Animal models are a useful research tool to understand mechanisms that determine susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.&#x000a0; This work models TB in a genetically heterogeneous experimental mouse population, called Diversity Outbred mice, which might better model the human population than standard inbred strains of mice that are commonly used in biomedical research.</p><p><bold>Results</bold></p><p>The results show that some immune responses and disease features in Diversity Outbred mice reflect disease features of human pulmonary TB &#x02013; including lung and granuloma necrosis, and the presence of neutrophils. Furthermore, the authors developed and tested models that could discriminate disease status with 77% accuracy based on the detection of three neutrophil chemokines: CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5. One of these chemokines, CXCL1, has the most potential to be a peripheral plasma biomarker of lung disease and of CXCL1 lung levels in individuals with TB. Additionally, as in humans, pro-inflammatory, cell-mediated, TH1 antigen-specific immune responses do not reflect TB disease state very well, but low immunological responses are very useful to identify non-exposed individuals.</p><p><bold>Implications and future directions</bold></p><p>This work is expected to influence the field, by showing that Diversity Outbred mice can model pathologic changes observed in human pulmonary TB, and therefore can be useful to identify and understand mechanisms of necrosis and neutrophil involvement in human TB. Future work using these mice will be exceptionally valuable when larger data sets are generated both for genetic studies, aimed at identifying novel genes and loci associated with increased susceptibility, and for longitudinal biomarker studies, in particular those focused on markers and models that can predict outcome before disease ensues.</p></boxed-text></p><p>A perplexing problem is that pulmonary TB, the contagious form of TB, most commonly occurs in immune-competent individuals who remain immunologically responsive to mycobacterial antigens and do not have TH1 defects (<xref rid="DMM020867C32" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C55" ref-type="bibr">Modlin and Bloom, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen and Woodworth, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C60" ref-type="bibr">Nunes-Alves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C82" ref-type="bibr">Vilaplana and Cardona, 2014</xref>). Thus, although TH1 immunity is a requirement for resistance, its presence does not prevent disease in susceptible individuals. For many years, lung and granuloma necrosis, and neutrophils have been recognized as negative indicators of pulmonary TB in humans (<xref rid="DMM020867C3" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C11" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C46" ref-type="bibr">Leong et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, many studies implicate neutrophils or neutrophil-like cells, and chemokines that recruit neutrophils, as causal mediators of lung damage in mice (<xref rid="DMM020867C38" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C50" ref-type="bibr">Lyadova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C56" ref-type="bibr">Nandi and Behar, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C87" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C51" ref-type="bibr">Major et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C18" ref-type="bibr">Dorhoi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C59" ref-type="bibr">Nouailles et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we assessed necrosis, neutrophils and the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 to determine whether these markers of TB disease show phenotypic variation in <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected DO mice.</p><p>Following aerosol infection, DO mice indeed varied in survival, morbidity, bacterial burden, granuloma composition, immunological cytokines and neutrophil chemokines. Nearly half of the DO mouse population rapidly developed morbidity associated with necrosis of lung tissue and granulomas, with neutrophil influx. Strong and significant disease correlates were lung neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5), TNF and dead cells. By contrast, IL-12, IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 were weak, or were not, disease correlates. In the periphery (plasma), only CXCL1 was a strong and statistically significant correlate of disease and of lung CXCL1, whereas CXCL5 was not, and neither were any other cytokines.</p><p>Statistical analyses, data mining and machine learning approaches identified important molecular features that were then used to classify status of <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected mice in the absence of disease indicators (survival, weight loss, bacterial burden). Lung TNF, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-12 and blood IL-2 and TNF were consistently identified as important. The most accurate models relied on CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 to classify &#x02018;supersusceptible&#x02019;, &#x02018;susceptible&#x02019;, &#x02018;resistant&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-infected&#x02019; mice. TNF was an important feature, but models that included TNF were less accurate because they confused resistant mice with supersusceptible mice. Immune cytokines were highly successful in discriminating non-infected from infected mice, but could not distinguish disease status.</p><p>In summary, of the molecules that we measured, neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 best distinguished TB disease in highly susceptible DO mice, whereas low and/or a lack of immune cytokines identified non-infected individuals. Furthermore, the classification model performed well using completely independent experimental data, resulting in 77% accuracy. Similar to humans, necrosis and neutrophils are TB disease features, and CXCL1 is a good peripheral biomarker in DO mice. (<xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, these results indicate DO mice are another useful murine model of pulmonary TB, in particular to understand the mechanisms that contribute to neutrophil recruitment and necrosis during early <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DO mice respond variably to atomized <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></title><p>All mice gained weight for at least two weeks following infection with &#x0223c;100 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacilli (<uri xlink:href="http://dmm.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dmm.020867/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>).

Reduced survival strongly reflected the daily rate of weight loss (not shown), as observed in other heterogeneous mice (<xref rid="DMM020867C29" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, these effects were independent of absolute body weight before infection or at peak body weight (not shown). Thus, body weight alone does not appear to protect against TB.

Thus, although ANOVA followed by MCT corroborated previous results, statistical analyses alone cannot discriminate the four classes of DO mice (supersusceptible, susceptible, resistant and non-infected) because there is no embedded classification method. This led us to use, for the first time in <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> research, machine learning methods to build testable classification models.

Although our data also contained three disease indicators (survival, percentage of peak body weight at euthanasia and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CFU), these were purposefully excluded because the goal was to identify molecules capable of classifying disease status and discrimination of a non-infected state. For building and testing classification models, only data from individual mice with complete data &#x02013; i.e. all 15 molecular features &#x02013; were used. Thus, the training and model validation steps used <italic>N</italic>=70 DO mice from the first experiment that had been infected with 127&#x000b1;68 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman bacilli and <italic>N</italic>=8 non-infected DO mice. Multiple machine learning approaches were used, listed in the Materials and Methods. Of these, classification trees were pursued because they produced the most accurate models. Validation for the model used the standard leave-one-out cross-validation for training data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM020867F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B). However, performance rates in training cannot be generalized. A more stringent approach to evaluate performance (accuracy in classifying disease status of DO and C57BL/6J mice) is to test the model using completely independent molecular data. Therefore, we tested the models using data from a completely independent experiment, again using only mice for which all 15 molecular parameters were available.

However, the model was not perfect. It misclassified some resistant and susceptible DO mice, and misclassified non-infected DO mice as resistant in testing.

Because of the method by which classification tree models are generated, it is not possible to examine &#x02018;misclassifications&#x02019; in the training data. Therefore, only misclassifications in the test data were evaluated. Thirteen of the 55 DO test mice were misclassified by using CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM020867F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Three were non-infected mice that were misclassified as resistant. This error was due to higher lung CXCL2 levels in the test (average 0.8&#x02005;ng/ml) than the training (average 0.4&#x02005;ng/ml) data. Thus, these non-infected mice were erroneously classified as resistant because of inter-experiment variability. Additional training data from non-infected mice would reduce this type of misclassification.</p><p>Seven resistant DO mice were misclassified. Of these seven, two were misclassified because of high CXCL1 and CXCL5, possibly owing to macrophage production without substantial neutrophil recruitment, which was corroborated by using microscopy analyses. The remaining five resistant mice were misclassified after the first node, despite having typical lung lesions. Three susceptible mice were misclassified after the first node, and these mice had a variety of lung lesions. Only one supersusceptible mouse was misclassified. This mouse was clearly different based on the molecule profile (lung CXCL1 less than 2.91&#x02005;ng/ml) and microscopy analyses. Instead of neutrophil infiltration and necrosis, morbidity reflected massive lung infiltration by non-necrotic macrophages.</p><p>Overall, the examination of misclassified mice was helpful. Misclassified non-infected mice reflected inter-experiment variability, which could be improved with additional training data. Two misclassified resistant mice better fit the susceptible class, showing that the model might help to re-classify ambiguous cases. It was unclear how susceptible mice were misclassified because the numbers were too small to draw meaningful conclusions. The one misclassified supersusceptible mouse had a unique phenotype &#x02013; marked infiltration by non-necrotic macrophages without neutrophils, which suggests another, but less common, response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that leads to rapid morbidity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We investigated survival, morbidity, bacterial load, immune and inflammatory molecules in <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected and non-infected DO mice, which is a genetically heterogeneous experimental population. It is another useful mouse model for TB research because the genetic diversity in the DO population mimics the diversity in the human population. The most relevant findings from the studies here are that many of the DO responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection model human responses, including lung and granuloma necrosis and neutrophil influx; production of inflammatory molecules; production of immunological cytokine responses, indicative of antigen-specific TH1 immunity; and production of immune-suppressive cytokines. Furthermore, like humans, neutrophil inflammation and necrosis are strong features of TB disease, whereas immune cytokines are weak or very weak correlates of disease.</p><p>We included IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-12, TNF, IL-2, IL-10 in these DO studies because these cytokines significantly alter survival when absent or blocked in inbred mice and because they have been extensively investigated in humans with TB. Like humans, <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected DO mice produce immune cytokines, but these molecules are poor disease correlates and could not be used to discriminate disease status. CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 were included because CXC-chemokines might contribute to detrimental inflammation and neutrophil influx, or might be biomarkers of lung disease (<xref rid="DMM020867C25" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C24" ref-type="bibr">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C79" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C5" ref-type="bibr">Beamer et al., 2008a</xref>,<xref rid="DMM020867C6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C16" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C30" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C88" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C59" ref-type="bibr">Nouailles et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, plasma CXCL1 has been suggested as a good peripheral biomarker of lung disease (<xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, in our studies we observed that lung CXC chemokines strongly correlate with disease and that CXCL1 appears to be the best peripheral biomarker of disease in a genetically diverse population. CXCL5 was not a good peripheral biomarker, and CXCL2 was below the limit of detection in plasma and could not be assessed as a peripheral biomarker.</p><p>To further utilize the DO data, we used supervised machine learning methods to generate and test tree classification models with the intent of identifying molecules that could determine TB disease status and identify the non-infected state. The best model successfully discriminated four classes (supersusceptible, susceptible, resistant and non-infected) from each other with 77% accuracy using only CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5. Performance was excellent in distinguishing supersusceptible mice from all other classes, but performed less well in distinguishing susceptible, resistant and non-infected mice. Non-infected mice were misclassified owing to inter-experimental variability, which can be corrected with additional data. The reasons for misclassification of susceptible and resistant mice were not clear, indicating that additional molecular features are needed to improve discrimination.</p><p>We also analyzed immune cytokines that are important for resistance (TNF, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-12, IL-2) and one cytokine that contributes to susceptibility (IL-10) (<xref rid="DMM020867C25" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C24" ref-type="bibr">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C79" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C5" ref-type="bibr">Beamer et al., 2008a</xref>,<xref rid="DMM020867C6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C16" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C30" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C88" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). All were poor correlates of disease with the exception of TNF, which is likely to reflect its dual role as a marker of resistance and as a disease correlate. All models using immune cytokines from any anatomic location (lung and periphery) failed to classify the disease status of <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected DO mice but were very good at discriminating non-infected mice. These findings are important because they reflect meta-analyses from human data and the recent literature reviews by experts, which conclude that a lack of TH1 responses identifies a lack of exposure to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, whereas the presence of TH1 immunity can neither rule in or out TB disease in humans (<xref rid="DMM020867C55" ref-type="bibr">Modlin and Bloom, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen and Woodworth, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C60" ref-type="bibr">Nunes-Alves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C65" ref-type="bibr">Rangaka et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the DO population could be a good experimental model to help identify better markers of immunological resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Performance of the tree classification models could have been improved by computational approaches &#x02013; such as collapsing the data into two classes (supersusceptible and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;), replicating data to yield groups of equivalent numbers and combining data into a single training set. However, we did not pursue these approaches because they do not reflect experimental or biological reality. The concept of generating and testing models with independent data might be relevant to human studies where subjects are assigned to clinical categories by TB disease severity (i.e. diagnoses of latent infection, active pulmonary TB, extra pulmonary TB etc.). The responses of each diagnostic category are then compared with each other and analyzed by using statistical methods. However, as we observed here, statistical analyses might not produce testable or accurate models if multiple classes are present and there is abundant or complex data. Therefore, we suggest that machine learning methods are another useful tool to discriminate TB disease status in humans.</p><p>DO mice have been used previously in only two studies (<xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C29" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>), but the breadth of DO responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was not the focus. Here, the survival of supersusceptible DO mice mimics that of immune-deficient C57BL/6 mice that cannot produce TH1 responses (reviewed in <xref rid="DMM020867C24" ref-type="bibr">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C16" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2009</xref> and references therein). However, neither DO mice nor the eight founder strains have these immune defects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DO mice are fully capable of producing TH1 immune cytokines locally and systemically in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Thus, susceptibility in the DO population is not due to inadequate immunity but instead reflects TB disease pathways involving necrosis and neutrophils, and possibly endothelial damage.</p><p>The remarkable susceptibility of some DO mice also indicates that genetic material from founder strains enhances susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Based on on-going studies, genetic material associated with increased susceptibility comes from four founder strains &#x02013; NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ (Christopher Sassetti, personal communication). However, further research is needed to identify novel susceptibility loci, and the DO population is ideally suited because the genomes are constructed for high-resolution genetic mapping (<xref rid="DMM020867C89" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C49" ref-type="bibr">Logan et al., 2013</xref>). DO susceptibility should not involve the <italic>Ipr1</italic> polymorphism in C3HeB/FeJ mice (<xref rid="DMM020867C62" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C77" ref-type="bibr">Tosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C63" ref-type="bibr">Pichugin et al., 2009</xref>) as the polymorphism is absent from DO founders (Mouse Phylogeny Viewer and the Sanger Mouse Genome Database accessed on October 6th 2014 by D.G. in Dr Gary Churchill's laboratory, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Therefore, future genetic studies using DO mice should identify additional genes and loci that contribute to susceptibility.</p><p>An important finding from these studies is that neutrophils and neutrophil chemokines are correlates of TB disease in <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected DO mice. These same patterns reflect pathologic features of human pulmonary TB. Interest in neutrophil responses and consequences during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in human and mouse studies has been increasing slowly over the past few decades and is now accelerating (<xref rid="DMM020867C3" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C38" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C21" ref-type="bibr">Eum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C51" ref-type="bibr">Major et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of studies implicate neutrophils or neutrophil-like cells as causal mediators of lung damage (<xref rid="DMM020867C38" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C50" ref-type="bibr">Lyadova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C56" ref-type="bibr">Nandi and Behar, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C87" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C51" ref-type="bibr">Major et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C18" ref-type="bibr">Dorhoi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C59" ref-type="bibr">Nouailles et al., 2014</xref>), but the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways are not yet well defined. The fundamental biological properties of neutrophils as short-lived, innate immune cells that secrete proteases, oxidants, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="DMM020867C19" ref-type="bibr">Elkington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C61" ref-type="bibr">Palanisamy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C1" ref-type="bibr">Amulic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C83" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C26" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C18" ref-type="bibr">Dorhoi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C59" ref-type="bibr">Nouailles et al., 2014</xref>) support this concept that neutrophils are destructive to lung tissue. However, experimental evidence in mouse <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> studies is not that straightforward. It appears that neutrophils play a variety of roles that differ depending on the host, the dose of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and the duration of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. For example, depletion of neutrophils during early infection improves survival of <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>susceptible DBA/2 mice but only with high-dose infection, and the same depletion protocol has no effect on resistant C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="DMM020867C38" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2006</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that neutrophils are detrimental under certain conditions. By contrast, our unpublished observations indicate that neutrophil depletion during chronic infection accelerates TB disease in CBA/J mice, suggesting that neutrophils are protective under other conditions. Given that some DO mice recruit neutrophils to the lungs and have high levels of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5, DO mice provide another useful model to understand the signals that attract neutrophils and to define the context(s) in which neutrophils are detrimental or protective. This will be important for a more complete understanding of TB pathogenesis across a genetically diverse population, and also to assess outcomes of interventions aimed at reducing neutrophil-mediated damage.</p><p>A limitation of our study could have been the use of light microscopy to identify immune and inflammatory responses in lung sections. This approach maintains the tissue and granuloma architecture, providing a wealth of visual information but at the expense of rigorous identification and quantification of specific immune cells (e.g. T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and all of their subsets etc.) that participate in host responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. We did not attempt identification of immature neutrophils (also known as &#x02018;bands&#x02019;, &#x02018;band cells&#x02019; or &#x02018;band neutrophils&#x02019;) because the morphology might overlap with immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells that have been recently described in lethal murine TB (<xref rid="DMM020867C78" ref-type="bibr">Tsiganov et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the remarkable susceptibility of some DO mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, future studies with a lower infectious dose will be important to slow lung damage and to improve detection of individual granulomas.

However, mice are important animals to investigate experimental questions that cannot be addressed in humans. Here, DO mice are advantageous because the population provides immunologically intact, genetically diverse individuals, and the phenotypic disease spectrum overlaps with humans. Using machine learning to build models that can classify disease status is new and useful, particularly where statistical analyses are not successful. In this context, machine learning will be especially useful to move beyond classification of TB disease status (which we describe here for the first time using only molecular correlates of disease) to studies that are capable of predicting TB disease outcome before it happens. That is a powerful approach and is achievable by sampling individual <italic>M.-tuberculosis-</italic>infected DO mice over time using peripheral host and mycobacterial biomarkers, followed by data mining, machine learning and independent testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (CSVM) at Tufts University has a letter of Assurance on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.

Resistant mice survived 35&#x02005;days of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection without any signs of morbidity, and retrospective analysis identified stable weight or weigh gain. Age- and sex-matched non-infected control mice, housed identically, were euthanized on day 35. Supersusceptible and resistant classes were fundamentally based on survival, whereas susceptible mice were those that survived to day 35 without external evidence of morbidity but had lost weight upon retrospective analysis. These classes and non-infected DO mice (<italic>N</italic>=8 for model training and <italic>N</italic>=3 for model testing) were used as the ground truth for establishing and training algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Cytokine measurements</title><p>ELISAs for TNF, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-12, IL-2 and IL-10 were performed using antibody pairs and standards or OptEIA kits (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) on serially diluted homogenized lung or from antigen-stimulated whole blood as described, with the exception that blood was diluted 1:5 (<xref rid="DMM020867C5" ref-type="bibr">Beamer et al., 2008a</xref>,<xref rid="DMM020867C6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).

Data had non-normal distributions, so Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated and identified as very weak (0-0.19), weak (0.20-0.39), moderate (0.40-0.59), strong (0.60-0.79), or very strong (0.80-1.0) and considered statistically significant if <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.

We applied standard machine learning methods for model training and testing, using mice with all parameters measured (<italic>N</italic>=78 mice for training and <italic>N</italic>=60 mice for testing). Five supervised [classification tree, relief attribute evaluation, consistency subset, spectral feature selection and a custom principal components algorithm (<xref rid="DMM020867C39" ref-type="bibr">Kira and Rendell, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C48" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Setiono, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C17" ref-type="bibr">Coppersmith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C69" ref-type="bibr">Rokach and Maimon, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="DMM020867C90" ref-type="bibr">Zheng and Liu, 2007</xref>)]; and two unsupervised [brute force and standard principal component analysis (<xref rid="DMM020867C12" ref-type="bibr">Boutsidis et al., 2008</xref>)] methods were used. Of all methods, classification trees and relief attribute evaluation were the most informative because these methods ranked molecular features by importance. Classification trees were pursued for validation and testing with independent cytokine and chemokine molecular data because these trees provided the most accurate models.</p></sec></sec>
