<p>Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle&#x000a0;aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has transformed diagnostic evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in respiratory medicine. This has revolutionized lung&#x000a0;cancer staging, providing a median sensitivity of&#x000a0;89%&#x000a0;for detection of malignant cells, and also affords high sensitivity for detection of granulomatous lymphadenitis in sarcoidosis.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Two specific diagnostic limitations have emerged as research priorities to maximize the benefits from EBUS-TBNA: (1) to increase sensitivity for detection of malignancy and hence&#x000a0;the negative predictive value, to reduce the need for&#x000a0;more invasive surgical sampling; and (2) to increase the sensitivity for&#x000a0;detection of active TB and improve discrimination between TB and sarcoidosis in granulomatous lymphadenitis. This distinction currently relies on assessment of demographic risk of TB or microbiological confirmation, which is unavailable in &#x0003e;&#x000a0;50%&#x000a0;of cases.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Genomewide transcriptional profiling can identify molecular signatures in peripheral blood or tumor specimens that could be used to improve diagnosis and&#x000a0;risk stratification of patients with infectious and inflammatory diseases or to guide targeted therapeutic strategies for individuals with cancer.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Feasibility of transcriptional profiling to detect gene expression associated with molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer in a small number of tumor-infiltrated nodes has been reported.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Granulomatous lymphadenitis has&#x000a0;never been assessed by this method, but three previous studies reported extensive overlap of peripheral blood transcriptional signatures associated with TB and sarcoidosis.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although computational machine learning techniques were successfully applied to peripheral blood gene signatures to discriminate between TB and sarcoidosis cases, confidence in this approach has been partly undermined because of minimal overlap between the discriminating genes identified in each study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Since the inflammatory processes in sarcoidosis are reputed to be compartmentalized,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> we speculated that transcriptional profiles at the site of disease may offer better discrimination.

Detailed information about study subjects is given in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Table&#x000a0;2</xref>. First, we focused our analysis on patients with &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; diagnoses of sarcoidosis, TB, cancer, or reactive lymphadenopathy, ascertained by routine clinical and laboratory assessments. Comparison of EBUS-TBNA genomewide data from these patients by PCA to visualize the greatest co-correlated differences between individual samples shows that sarcoidosis, TB, and reactive lymph node samples clustered together, and most but not all cancer samples clustered separately (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>Despite the overlap in the clustering analysis described above, direct comparison of gene expression data identified differentially expressed genes between granulomatous and nongranulomatous lymph node samples (488 genes), between TB and sarcoidosis samples (58 genes), and between malignant and reactive samples&#x000a0;(1,223 genes) (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Tables&#x000a0;3-5</xref> for differentially expressed gene lists). Granulomatous lymph nodes were&#x000a0;significantly enriched for genes associated with immunologic processes integral to cell-mediated immunity and granuloma formation and regulated by&#x000a0;canonical transcription factors involved in proinflammatory and cytokine responses (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Table&#x000a0;6</xref>). In keeping with previous peripheral blood transcriptional profiling studies,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> genomewide transcriptional profiles of TB and sarcoidosis lymph node samples were very similar. We identified only 16&#x000a0;genes with significantly higher expression in sarcoidosis and 42 genes with higher expression levels in&#x000a0;TB lymph node samples (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>In the nongranulomatous samples, malignant lymph node samples were significantly enriched for genes involved in cell cycle control and extracellular matrix interactions, consistent with processes related to cancer development and metastasis (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Fig 5</xref>), and under the transcriptional regulation of Kruppel-like factors and other zinc finger protein family members (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Table&#x000a0;7</xref>).

Therefore, we&#x000a0;assessed the performance of SVM discrimination between diagnostic categories using the differentially expressed transcriptional signatures described above. In this analysis, we used repeated bootstrap subsampling cross-validation<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> with five, 15, or 25 training cases to&#x000a0;evaluate the classification performance of the SVM, ensuring the test set was always independent of the training set. ROC curves showed that the SVM performance improved as the cohort sample size increased, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values &#x0003e; 0.9 in each case (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). A recognized limitation of SVM is risk of overfitting of training data, but the high levels of accuracy consistently achieved in multiple iterations using different combinations of training and test data strongly suggest overfitting does not confound the present analysis.</p><p>Next we assessed the performance of SVM classification in a two-step decision tree sequence, using leave-one-out cross-validation as an alternative cross-validation strategy that optimizes the size of the training cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;3</xref>). In step one, we classified each sample as granulomatous or nongranulomatous. In step two, samples classified as granulomatous were then subclassified as TB or sarcoidosis, and those classified as&#x000a0;nongranulomatous were subclassified as cancer or reactive lymphadenopathy. We achieved excellent specificity across all four diagnostic groups and high sensitivity for detection of malignancy (93%) and sarcoidosis (85%) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Tables&#x000a0;8, 9</xref>). This analysis was less sensitive for identification of reactive lymphadenopathy (80%) and TB (67%), but we noted a positive relationship between test sensitivity and sample size for each diagnosis (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>We also sought to identify the minimum number of genes needed to accurately classify cases using each SVM. The most discriminating genes were identified by their weighting in the training data sets using repeated bootstrap subsampling cross-validation (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Table&#x000a0;10</xref> for lists of the most discriminating genes). Cumulative inclusion of these genes in order of their weighting in the SVM training data improved the ROC curve AUCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>A). To achieve ROC curve AUC &#x0003e; 0.9, expression data from at least five genes were required to discriminate granulomatous and nongranulomatous cases, 19 genes to discriminate TB and sarcoidosis, and 150 genes to discriminate cancer and reactive cases.</p><p>Peripheral blood gene signatures that distinguish TB and sarcoidosis have been reported previously.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These show only modest overlap with our lymph node-derived differential gene expression signature (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>B) and clearly perform less well in discriminating TB from sarcoidosis lymph node samples by SVM classification (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs 4</xref>C, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">4</xref>D). This suggests that the gene signatures exhibit context specificity and that peripheral blood data may not faithfully reflect the site of disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>SVM Classification of Undiagnosed Lymphadenopathy</title><p>Finally, we tested the two-step SVM decision-tree sequence described above on cases in which a &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; diagnosis could not be made at the time of EBUS-TBNA. We compared SVM classification of these samples with the final diagnosis based on follow-up data (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>). SVM analysis identified &#x0201c;granulomatous disease&#x0201d; in almost all specimens with histologic evidence of granulomas and two samples without granulomas on histology (Possible S2 and S3). A definite diagnosis of sarcoidosis was later confirmed in one case (Possible S2), after assessment of further lymph node samples obtained by mediastinoscopy revealed noncaseating granulomas. Another case (Probable TB2) was classified by SVM as &#x0201c;sarcoidosis&#x0201d; but subsequently confirmed as &#x0201c;TB.&#x0201d; The majority of &#x0201c;possible cancer&#x0201d; samples were classified as &#x0201c;reactive,&#x0201d; consistent with histologic assessments. However, SVM classified two cases as &#x0201c;cancer,&#x0201d; in the absence of histologic evidence. Subsequent examination of surgically resected specimens confirmed metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node, which had shown no evidence of malignancy on EBUS-TBNA 6&#x000a0;weeks previously (Possible C10). Strikingly, SVM also predicted the presence of &#x0201c;cancer&#x0201d; 4&#x000a0;months before tumor involvement was discernible on&#x000a0;histology in another case (Possible C11). SVM predicted &#x0201c;cancer&#x0201d; in one further individual (U2) with a&#x000a0;presumptive diagnosis of sarcoidosis and no evidence of&#x000a0;malignancy during long-term follow up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The development of EBUS has revolutionized investigation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy by facilitating minimally invasive sampling of lymph nodes&#x000a0;at the site of disease. Transcriptional profiling of&#x000a0;EBUS-TBNA in granulomatous and malignant lymphadenopathy revealed clear evidence of the key biologic processes relevant to each disease.

Nonetheless, assessment of globin depletion or RNA sequencing to increase sensitivity should be considered in future studies.</p><p>The similarity between TB and sarcoidosis profiles suggests that by the time of clinical presentation, the molecular pathology in these diseases is comparable.

Importantly, the SVM models identified the most influential genes and opportunity to test the feasibility of&#x000a0;using targeted transcriptional analysis rather than genomewide technologies in future studies. Our analysis suggested that this might be possible for discriminating granulomatous from nongranulomatous disease and TB&#x000a0;from sarcoidosis using multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of 20 to 30 genes. However, expression data from more than 150 genes were required to discriminate cancer and reactive lymphadenopathy.</p><p>The application of SVM in a two-step decision tree model was significantly more sensitive than mycobacterial culture for identification of TB and equivalent to histologic detection of noncaseating granulomas for sarcoidosis.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Notably, SVM predicted the presence of granulomatous disease in one EBUS-guided biopsy with no granulomas on histology, from an individual subsequently diagnosed with sarcoidosis after lymph node samples obtained by mediastinoscopy confirmed granulomatous inflammation. Importantly, differentially expressed genes that distinguished sarcoidosis from TB lymph node transcriptional profiles performed better than previously published gene signatures derived from peripheral blood,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> suggesting that peripheral blood does not wholly reflect the profiles at the site of disease&#x000a0;and strengthening the case for lymph node sampling for maximum diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>SVM also classified specimens from two individuals undergoing EBUS-guided lymph node sampling for lung&#x000a0;cancer staging as &#x0201c;cancer,&#x0201d; despite no histologic evidence of malignancy. In keeping with this, SVM classification was slightly more sensitive than the reported median sensitivity of histologic identification of&#x000a0;malignancy.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In both cases, further biopsies taken from these nodes 6&#x000a0;weeks to 4&#x000a0;months after the initial specimens, demonstrated tumor infiltration that may reflect progression of micrometastatic disease. These examples highlight the potential power of combining transcriptional profiling with a computational classification algorithm to provide a more sensitive approach for identification of subtle molecular indicators of granulomatous disease or malignancy that&#x000a0;are discernible before histologic or cytologic abnormalities become evident. Importantly, this strategy has the potential to identify individuals who might benefit from more frequent surveillance and to improve the current low negative predictive value of 40%&#x000a0;for EBUS-guided lymph node sampling in isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> which will avoid unnecessary invasive mediastinoscopy procedures and minimize delays in definitive treatments. We recognize that SVM analysis of transcriptome data did not correctly classify every case in our study; therefore, this&#x000a0;approach does not currently supersede clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. However, both&#x000a0;accuracy and sensitivity of SVM classification improved as the training dataset sample size increased, suggesting the potential for more precise discrimination and increased sensitivity with expansion of the current cohort. Our data pave the way for larger-scale observational cohorts to validate the findings presented here and controlled trials to investigate the impact of this approach on clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We propose that transcriptional profiling of lymph node&#x000a0;samples from the site of disease combined with machine learning data analysis offers a novel strategy with&#x000a0;molecular-level resolution that could be applied to&#x000a0;augment conventional investigation of clinically ambiguous cases of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
