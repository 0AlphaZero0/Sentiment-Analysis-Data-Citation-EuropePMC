<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is one of the most successful human pathogens that is estimated to have infected one third of the human population and to be responsible for nine million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) in 2013 (WHO Global Tuberculosis report 2014). <italic>Mtb</italic> parasitizes macrophages and can persist for decades as a latent infection inside its human host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The formation of granulomas is central to the pathology of TB and the development of latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. TB granulomas are highly organized host cellular structures that contain an inner core of infected macrophages and necrotic cell debris (the caseum) where bacteria persist extracellular. In the surrounding cell layers, other immune cells, including dendritic cells, neutrophils, and T and B cells, wall off the bacteria inside the granuloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A latent infection in granulomas has the ability to reactivate after many years, and the disease can be transmitted when granuloma integrity is lost. An alarming rise in antibiotic resistances and the lack of an effective vaccine against latent or reactivated TB emphasize the need for novel therapeutic strategies to control TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Animal models are indispensable for studying the host and bacterial factors involved in TB pathology and for evaluating new drug and vaccine candidates. Important insights into human TB pathology have been inferred from experimental <italic>Mtb</italic> infections in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates, particularly macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, now for over 10&#x000a0;years, the zebrafish has become widely used as an alternative animal model for TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Zebrafish can be infected with <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (<italic>Mm</italic>), a natural pathogen of cold-blooded vertebrates. The genomes of <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Mm</italic> share 3000 orthologs with an average amino acid identity of 85&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. <italic>Mm</italic> occasionally causes a granulomatous skin infection in humans known as &#x0201c;fish tank granuloma&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In zebrafish, <italic>Mm</italic> causes a systemic disease with containment of bacteria in granulomas that show strong structural similarity with the human TB granuloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although differences in the adaptation of <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Mm</italic> to different hosts must not be ignored, the important virulence factors of <italic>Mtb</italic> are functionally able to complement mutations in <italic>Mm</italic> genes and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Studies using the zebrafish-<italic>Mm</italic> model have contributed importantly to the changed view of the role of the granuloma in TB pathogenesis that has emerged over the recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Historically, the granuloma has been regarded as a static host defense structure. However, granuloma formation is driven by bacterial virulence, and it is now widely accepted that granulomas are highly dynamic structures that, especially during early stages of pathogenesis, can promote the dissemination of mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Work in zebrafish has shown that the presence of macrophages is sufficient to initiate granuloma formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This means that the early stages of granuloma formation can be observed in optically transparent zebrafish embryos and larvae that have a functional innate immune system but have not yet developed adaptive immunity. The use of these zebrafish early life stages has shown that secondary granulomas can be seeded by the egression of infected macrophages from a primary granuloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. That granulomas are not impenetrable is evidenced by experiments with superinfecting mycobacteria that are found to be transported by infected macrophages into established granulomas. This was initially observed during <italic>Mm</italic> infection of zebrafish and frogs and has subsequently been confirmed during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Intravital imaging in both zebrafish and mice has demonstrated the migration of immune cells throughout the process of granuloma development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The heterogeneity and dynamic nature of granulomas observed in zebrafish and mice is in perfect agreement with serial PET-CT imaging data from <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cynomolgus macaques showing that individual granulomas within the same host can regress and even be sterilized, while other granulomas progress during the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This review will discuss how studies either in adult zebrafish or in embryos and larvae have advanced our understanding of mycobacterial virulence factors and of host genes implicated in immune protection or TB pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>TB in adult zebrafish</title><p>While entry via de gastrointestinal tract is most likely the primary route of <italic>Mm</italic> infection in the natural environment, experimental infection of adult zebrafish is commonly achieved by intraperitoneal injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Dependent on the particular dose and strain, the infection manifests with acute symptoms or develops as a chronic progressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Acute disease is characterized by rapid lethal inflammation and is more frequently observed with human-derived isolates of <italic>Mm</italic> that form a distinct genetic cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Swelling of the abdomen, hemorrhages, and skin ulcerations are typically observed at the end stage of the chronic progressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This is associated with a strong induction of immune response genes and inflammation markers at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Well before external symptoms become apparent, well-organized granulomas are formed in different organs, including the liver, pancreas, kidney, intestines, and spleen and sometimes also in the connective tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Some intraperitoneally infected zebrafish also develop granulomas in close relation with brain tissue and meninges; therefore, the model can also be used to study TB meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Granulomas in adult zebrafish consist of tightly packed epithelial cells surrounding a central region where macrophages are the predominant cell type and mycobacteria are detectable by acid-fast staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Importantly, most granulomas in zebrafish show necrosis in the central core, and many are hypoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Central necrosis is a hallmark feature of the human TB granuloma that has been difficult to reproduce in mouse and can be mimicked only in some newer mouse models of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, mature granulomas in zebrafish often are multi-centric and surrounded by a fibrous capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Calcification of granulomas has not been observed in zebrafish, and their granulomas contain much less lymphocytes than those of human TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite this lower number of lymphocytes, the function of adaptive immunity is critical for controlling TB in zebrafish since mutants in <italic>rag1</italic> are hypersusceptible to <italic>Mm</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The chronic progressive zebrafish infection model has proven useful for antimycobacterial drug screening as well as for testing of host-targeted drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Reducing vascularization of zebrafish granulomas by pharmacological inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) signaling decreases overall infection burden, and fish display an increased frequency of sterilized granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Together with a study of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected rabbits, this suggests the potential use of antiangiogenic drugs in combination with anti-TB drugs for treatment of TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The study of mechanisms underlying latency and reactivation of TB is hampered by the limitations of animal models. Recently, it has been shown that the zebrafish-<italic>Mm</italic> model can be used to mimic aspects of latent disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Several weeks after intraperitoneal injection with a low-dose of <italic>Mm</italic> bacteria, zebrafish developed stable bacterial loads and constant numbers of granulomas. Ex vivo activation by resuscitation promoting factor demonstrated the dormancy of Mm under these conditions. The development of latency relies on <italic>rag1</italic>-mediated adaptive immunity, and immunosuppression induced by gamma irradiation leads to reactivation of the dormant bacterial population. This model has much potential for preclinical testing of new drug and vaccine candidates. As a proof-of-principle, BCG vaccination and DNA vaccination with different mycobacterial antigens were shown to protect zebrafish from <italic>Mm</italic> infection in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Zebrafish are not easily inbred, and therefore, large variations are often observed in studies using this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, the natural heterogeneity of the zebrafish population has been taken advantage of to gain understanding of genetic differences that are associated with the ability of individuals to control latent infection or that pose risk factors for reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This study showed that zebrafish individuals with well-controlled infection display not only an efficient Th1 immune response but also an adequate Th2 response. Zebrafish heterozygous for a mutation in <italic>furinA</italic>, encoding a proprotein convertase of Th1 cells, showed reduced mycobacterial load in the latency model, suggesting proprotein convertase inhibitors as potential drugs for TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>A number of mutants in mycobacterial virulence genes have been tested in adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Mm</italic> use type VII secretion systems, named ESX-1 to ESX-5, to secrete proteins across their lipid-rich cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The ESX-1 system is a major virulence factor and absent in attenuated strains that carry the so-called RD1 deletion (&#x00394;RD1), including the live vaccine strain <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In zebrafish, several &#x00394;RD1 <italic>Mm</italic> strains showed decreased virulence, supporting the usefulness of the fish model for TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Infection with &#x00394;RD1 <italic>Mm</italic> has been shown to delay the kinetics of granuloma formation, resulting in solitary and loose macrophage aggregates and very few necrotizing granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, as discussed further below, &#x00394;RD1 delays the kinetics of granuloma formation in zebrafish embryos that only possess an innate immune system. However, in the case of an ESX-5 mutant, marked differences were observed between infections in zebrafish embryos and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The ESX-5 secretion system is required for transport of proteins of the PE and PPE families, of which the functions remain largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. While ESX-5-deficient <italic>Mm</italic> is slightly attenuated in zebrafish embryos, it turned out to be more virulent in adults, causing rapid development of necrotizing granulomas accompanied by increased expression of proinflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The different response of embryos and adults to ESX-5 mutants is likely not mediated by the adaptive immune system, since ESX-5 mutants still have a growth advantage over wild-type <italic>Mm</italic> in <italic>rag1</italic>-deficient zebrafish. This study indicates that <italic>Mm</italic> relies on ESX-5-mediated protein secretion for establishing persistent infection and highlights that parallel use of embryo and adult zebrafish models can be important for unraveling mycobacterial virulence mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>TB in zebrafish embryos and larvae</title><p>The external fertilization of zebrafish eggs provides easy access to developing embryos. Embryos naturally hatch by 2&#x000a0;days post fertilization (dpf), but the chorion can be removed at 1&#x000a0;dpf to facilitate experimental infection. By 72&#x000a0;h post fertilization (hpf), embryos reach the larval stage and larvae become capable of independent feeding by 5&#x000a0;dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. During this developmental time period, the primary functional immune cell types are the macrophages and neutrophils; thus, immunity relies on the innate arm of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Embryos and larvae develop normally under anesthesia with tricaine methane sulfonate (MS222), which makes them ideal for non-invasive time lapse imaging. A growing collection of fluorescent reporter lines facilitates the visualization of different immune cell types, subcellular structures, and the activation of immune response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Knockdown studies in zebrafish embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides have strongly contributed to the understanding of early mycobacterial pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In addition, random mutagenesis screens proved a useful source of zebrafish mutants for TB research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Recent advances in gene targeting technology should lead to an increased use of knockout lines in both embryo/larval and adult TB models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This will also enable gene disruption in a cell- or tissue-specific manner, which until now has been a limitation of the zebrafish model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Zebrafish embryos and larvae are particularly useful for screens of anti-TB drugs that can be added simply to the medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, not all compounds are efficiently taken up via the skin, and therefore, drug efficacy in this system should be correlated with uptake characteristics in order to eliminate false negatives and to enable better comparison with tests in mammalian models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Systemic or localized infection of embryos and larvae can be achieved by microinjecting <italic>Mm</italic> bacteria at different sites, each of which has specific advantages to address different research questions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

The earliest opportunity for intravenous infection is shortly after the onset of blood circulation at 26&#x000a0;hpf, but microinjection into the vascular system can also be performed at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. <italic>Mm</italic> bacteria delivered into the blood are predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This is a rapid process, with a dose of around 200&#x000a0;CFU being internalized within 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. At 3&#x000a0;days post infection (dpi), infected and non-infected macrophages are visible in tight granuloma-like aggregates spread over the larval tissues but mostly occurring in the proximity of blood vessels in the ventral part of the tail, in the area of a temporary hematopoietic site, named the caudal hematopoietic tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Most intravenously infected embryos also develop aggregates in different areas of the brain, and this still occurs when bacteria are injected at a later time point (4&#x000a0;dpf) when the blood brain barrier has been formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Electron microscopy has shown that some of the infected macrophages in larval granuloma-like aggregates display an epithelioid morphology and that multi-nucleate giant cells are present, which are distinctive features of mature granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, since <italic>Mm</italic> bacteria in these aggregates express granuloma-specific fluorescent reporter genes, the microenvironment appears to be similar to that in mature granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The environment of these larval granulomas has been shown to favor the rapid development and dissemination of a multi-drug-tolerant intracellular <italic>Mm</italic> population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Bacterial efflux pump inhibitors like verapamil can reduce this tolerance, demonstrating that the system can be used for investigating the mechanisms underlying tolerance and for therapeutic approaches to overcome tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Infection with labeled <italic>Mm</italic> strains allows easy assessment of granuloma numbers, individual granuloma sizes, and overall bacterial burden from fluorescence images, making the intravenous infection model well suited to analyze the function of bacterial virulence factors and host genes as well as for evaluating drug effects on granuloma formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Yolk infection</title><p>Injection of <italic>Mm</italic> into the yolk of developing embryos between the 16&#x02013;128 cell stage leads to an infection that initially remains restricted to this area where macrophages do not enter but from 3&#x000a0;dpi spreads by an unknown mechanism into the larval tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].

In agreement, increased bacterial burden is observed in a zebrafish transgenic line ectopically expressing a gain-of-function truncation of chemokine receptor Cxcr4 that causes retention of neutrophils in the hematopoietic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. In wild-type larvae, neutrophils attracted to granulomas around 3&#x000a0;dpi have been observed to phagocytose dying infected macrophages.

At earlier stages of infection, when <italic>Mm</italic> is mostly restricted to macrophages, uninfected neutrophils respond by production of nitric oxide, detected by increased levels of nitrotyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].

In contrast, it has been found that Myd88 is not required for the initial recruitment of macrophages in a local hindbrain infection model, indicating that mycobacteria have evolved mechanisms to avoid TLR/Myd88-mediated defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Mycobacterial cell wall lipids have been implicated in this immune evasion strategy, notably the phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM) known to be major virulence factors of pathogenic mycobacteria. PDIM-deficient <italic>Mm</italic> strains or other bacterial species not containing PDIM (<italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) trigger a TLR/Myd88-dependent response.

These findings led to an interesting model proposing that pathogenic mycobacteria use PDIM to mask the underlying TLR ligands and thereby establish infection in a permissive macrophage population that is encountered in the lower respiratory tract where <italic>Mtb</italic> is known to initiate infection rather than in the upper tract where TLR/Myd88-dependent macrophage polarization is induced by the presence of resident microflora and inhaled environmental microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Besides this role in masking TLR recognition, PDIM lipids are likely to impact directly on the microbicidal activity of macrophages through their capacity to insert into the plasma membrane and into the membranes of intracellular compartments where mycobacteria replicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].</p><p>The CCL2-CCR2 chemokine signaling axis has been linked to the recruitment of permissive macrophages by PDIM-containing <italic>Mm</italic>, in a manner dependent on phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].

While CCL2 is generally considered an inflammatory chemokine, there is evidence that it can shift the polarization of macrophages toward an antiinflammatory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. This is consistent with the model proposing that CCL2-CCR2 signaling promotes mycobacterial infectivity under low inoculum conditions and with a genetic association study correlating high expression of CCL2 with TB susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p><p>Mutation of <italic>cxcr3.2</italic>, one of three zebrafish homologs of the human CXCR3 receptor, has a similar effect on macrophage recruitment to <italic>Mm</italic> infection in the zebrafish hindbrain injection model as knockdown of Ccl2-Ccr2 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It is currently not known if these two chemokine-mediated recruitment mechanisms act redundantly or in a concerted manner. The interferon-&#x003b3;-inducible inflammatory chemokines CXCL9, 10, and 11, the ligands of human CXCR3, show enhanced plasma levels in TB patients, and CXCR3 ligands are also expressed in pulmonary granulomas of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cynomolgus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. Besides reducing macrophage recruitment in response to locally injected <italic>Mm</italic> bacteria or Cxcl11-like chemokines, <italic>cxcr3.2</italic> mutation also results in other phenotypes suggesting that mycobacteria use CXCR3 signaling to their advantage. First, <italic>cxcr3.2</italic> mutation reduces dissemination of <italic>Mm</italic> from the hindbrain ventricle to other regions of the head, trunk, and tail. Second, <italic>cxcr3.2</italic> mutation reduces the expansion of granulomas, either those resulting from disseminated local infection or those resulting from systemic intravenous infection. Third, <italic>cxcr3.2</italic>-deficient macrophages have reduced basal motility. Although this motility defect can be overcome by delivering Cxcr3.2-independent stimuli, it might limit spreading of mycobacteria between macrophages in granulomas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. A host-beneficial effect of disrupting the CXCR3 axis is not limited to the context of macrophage function in zebrafish larvae. <italic>CXCR3</italic>-deficient mice control chronic <italic>Mtb</italic> infection better than wild-type animals, and this has been attributed to an adverse effect on T cell priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>].

If such polarization would occur in the context of mycobacterial infection, this would make macrophages more permissive for bacterial growth, which is contrast with the host-beneficial effect of CXCR3 deficiency in both zebrafish and murine TB models. Together, these studies indicate that, rather than iNos-mediated defense, other CXCR3-dependent mechanisms are important for control of mycobacterial infection and support further investigation of the CXCR3-CXCL11 axis as a host therapeutic target for TB treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>].</p><p>It currently remains unanswered if there are pre-existing macrophage subsets in zebrafish embryos responding to Ccl2- or Cxcl11-like chemokines and Myd88-dependent cues, or if these signals might drive different polarization of recruited macrophages. The source of the chemoattractants also remains to be established. Two not mutually exclusive origins of infection-inducible chemokines are the neuroepithelial cells lining the hindbrain ventricle or the macrophages themselves. Few macrophages can be resident in the cavity prior to injection or are initially attracted independent of the bacterial presence due to a minor wounding effect that is unavoidable in this assay. In situ mRNA detection of the chemokines and their receptors is unfortunately limited by low expression levels. However, RNAseq of leukocyte populations isolated by fluorescent-activated cell sorting suggests that macrophages could indeed be the source of both CCL and CXCL chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref> and unpublished results].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Protective and pathological roles of inflammation</title><p>The dual role that inflammation plays in TB pathogenesis is extensively discussed in recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>].

The optical transparency of zebrafish larvae has helped to distinguish whether defects in inflammation affect the early formation of granulomas or their maintenance. Knockdown of the Tnf receptor in zebrafish accelerates granuloma formation but leads to rapid breakdown of granulomas and extracellular growth of <italic>Mm</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Limited Tnf production leads to the same phenotype, supporting that Tnf is dispensable for granuloma formation but critical for the maintenance of granuloma integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

Other intersections between the cytokine and eicosanoid networks have recently been revealed, notably the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) driven by IL-1, which promotes the control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. It is now widely believed that a better understanding of the complexity of this interplay holds promise for immunotherapeutic interventions using clinically approved drugs to carefully manipulate the cytokine/eicosanoid balance in TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].</p><p>A hyperinflamed status can be induced in zebrafish larvae by injection of recombinant TNF, by overexpression of the leukotriene biosynthetic enzyme Lta4h, or by knockdown of the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn6, a negative regulator of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. In all cases, this results in hypersusceptibility to <italic>Mm</italic> infection, underscoring the importance of a balanced inflammatory response. Mechanistically, the detrimental effect of high levels of Tnf in zebrafish has been attributed to the mode of cell death of <italic>Mm</italic>-infected macrophages in this situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Excess Tnf triggers the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species through Rip1-Rip3-dependent signaling, and this induces a programmed type of necrotic cell death. This necroptotic cell death is mediated by cyclophilin D, which is involved in formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex and by the lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase, which is required for ceramide production. Pharmacological inhibition of these two pathways prevents initiation of the necroptotic program and reverses the hypersusceptibility of zebrafish larvae with high Tnf levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In the case of low Tnf levels, macrophages likely undergo passive necrosis with a similar exacerbating effect on <italic>Mm</italic> infection as the induction of the necroptotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. These results are in line with evidence that virulence factors of <italic>Mtb</italic> trigger necrotic cell death of macrophages, while inhibiting the immunologically silent apoptotic cell death program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>].

During autophagy (or macroautophagy), protein aggregates, organelles or intracellular bacteria become enclosed in autophagosomes characterized by a double membrane and the marker protein Lc3.

Selective autophagy by the receptor-mediated pathway requires that mycobacteria escape from the phagosomal compartment or induce damage to the phagosomal membrane permitting them to be ubiquitinated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A functional ESX-1 secretion system is required for the rupture of phagosomes and ubiquitination of mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. However, ESX-1-deficient BCG bacteria are also sensitive to autophagy stimulation, indicating that mycobacteria can be targeted to autophagy via multiple mechanisms that may include sequestering of complete phagosomes by autophagosomal isolation membranes, the recruitment of Lc3 to phagosomes (Lc3-associated phagocytosis), or the formation of amphisomes through the fusion between autophagosomes and endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>].

In vivo visualization of the autophagic response to mycobacteria in zebrafish larvae has supported many previous in vitro studies that pointed to the central role of autophagy in host defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Despite limitations in immunological reagents and characterization of the adaptive immune system, adult zebrafish also are a useful addition to TB research, in particular because of the similarities in the structure of fish and human TB granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Zebrafish models are now increasingly applied for translational research into host-directed therapies for tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. Potential drug targets emerging from this work include pathways involved in macrophage migration, inflammation, cell death regulation, hypoxia signaling, angiogenesis, and mTOR-independent autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Targeting the host avoids direct selective pressure on bacteria and therefore has lower risk of drug resistance development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, possible side effects on the host are a major concern. In view of the many useful characteristics discussed above, zebrafish can play an important role in assessing developmental toxicity and characterizing the mechanisms of drug action in vivo.</p></sec>
