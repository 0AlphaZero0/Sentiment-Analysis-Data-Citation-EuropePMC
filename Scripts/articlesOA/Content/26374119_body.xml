<sec sec-type="intro" id="h0.0"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a threatening disease, with currently 9 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths per year (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). One-third of the global population is latently infected (latent TB infection [LTBI]) with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, thus facing the risk of developing active TB during their lifetime. Effective drug treatment regimens exist, albeit they have been challenged by increasing multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and totally drug-resistant forms of TB (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In addition, TB diagnosis and control are still hampered by the unavailability of vaccines capable of preventing TB. The fact that only an estimated 5 to 10% of people with LTBI develop active TB disease combined with the high occurrence of infection in household contacts emphasizes that the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. A better understanding of the biological processes involved in progression from LTBI to active TB will contribute toward better intervention measures. To this end, sufficiently validated biomarkers to support development of TB vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs are needed (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To add further complexity to this scenario, the biology of and interactions between the host, microbe, and environment are highly complex and variable (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Some factors are known to affect the host response to <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection, including inherent host genetics, variability among hosts, status of the immune system, and external factors, such as nutrition, pollution, coinfection, frequency of previous infections and coinfections, stress levels, and adaptations by bacterial strains in specific host populations (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). External factors are also known to affect host epigenetics, prompting us to include the epigenome in future TB biomarker research. In particular, stable marks such as those derived from DNA methylation patterns are currently absent from studies of this kind, while more dynamic epigenetic marks (histone modifications) have uncovered matters relating to &#x0201c;trained immunity,&#x0201d; even in the case of recipients of the only current TB vaccine, <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> BCG (bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>To date, transcriptomic profiles from peripheral blood cells have been the main focus in the exploration for biomarkers (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition to easy access, blood also represents a site of dynamic exchange of chemokines, cytokines, and cells trafficking between foci of active disease and the lymphoid system (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Within the immune system, cells have their own discrete functions, but the system as a whole exerts a concerted function with remarkable plasticity. Hence careful consideration of different cell types is required when describing either predispositions for disease development or the resultant functions following infection. Understanding how each specific cell contributes to maintenance of LTBI instead of progressing to active TB is essential. Professional phagocytes play a central role in these processes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Phagocytes comprise dendritic cells, monocytes (differentiating into macrophages), and granulocytes, predominantly neutrophils. Monocytes and granulocytes have epigenomes distinct from other cell types (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Due to its inherent stability, disruption of the normal DNA methylome can produce stable cell populations with prolonged aberrant phenotypes and thereby contribute to disease, which suggests a useful source of biomarkers for risk stratification and disease diagnosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In primary human leukocyte subsets, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are associated with immune-mediated disease, preferentially map to cell-specific regulatory hypomethylated regions (HMRs) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Such loci, in combination with DNA methylation sites, offer hypotheses toward depicting cellular subsets in which specific epigenetic changes may drive disease.</p><p>This pilot study aims to investigate the level of differentiation between TB patients and genetically unrelated LTBI household contacts in a cell-specific manner. Isolated monocytes and granulocytes from peripheral blood were investigated to determine the extent and biological functions of differences between the DNA methylome, transcriptome (mRNA and microRNA [miR]), and proteome at a global level using high-throughput techniques.</p><p>Toward this end, we studied each platform in a descriptive manner, followed by differential analyses between LTBI and TB at each platform in monocytes and granulocytes alone and in combination. Next, we determined if these differences point toward specific functions. Finally, we analyzed these data to determine which, if any, correlations of differences between LTBI and TB exist in functions from one platform to another. Specifically, we wanted to ascertain in this very-limited-sample-size study whether a portion of the differences between LTBI and TB in global DNA methylation and miR platforms reveal gene regulation that will be reflected by the mRNA data set and in turn is translated into the proteome.</p><p>At the levels of DNA methylation, miR, mRNA, and proteins, the data allowed differentiation between LTBI and TB. Moreover, unique functions were congruent from one platform to another, suggesting a global regulation of function (or loss thereof) during TB.</p></sec><sec id="h1"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>Global DNA methylation in LTBI and TB.</title><p>The DNA methylation status of over 485,000 CpGs was interrogated in isolated monocytes and granulocytes from LTBI and TB participants. For both cell types, a clear bimodal data distribution was evident, with no major variation of these distributions between LTBI and TB (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A and B</xref> in the supplemental material) either together or per cell type. Frequency distributions illustrate similar levels of hypomethylated (0 to 30%) and hypermethylated (70 to 100%) CpGs in both study groups. This observation differs from the overall spread of methylated CpGs in precursor cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>We tested whether methylation of CpGs in professional phagocytes was related to known functions in these cell types. The list of genes with fully hyper- or hypomethylated CpGs associated with promoter regions was tested for enrichment in blood transcription modules (BTMs) using the hypergeometric test, in which genes with fully hyper- or hypomethylated CpGs associated with promoter regions constituted the foreground set, while genes lacking such sites constituted the background (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Genes with promoter-associated hypermethylated sites (i.e., putatively silenced in the analyzed cell subsets) were not significantly enriched in BTMs. However, significant enrichment in BTMs for genes with hypomethylated CpGs associated with promoter regions (i.e., potentially activated genes) was observed with statistically significant enrichment in modules involved in cell cycling and transcription, as well as those involved in immune activation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material).</p><p>To determine which known sources of variation (that is, disease phenotype, gender, and cell type) explain the total variance of the data set, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) regression of principal components (PCs) over the independent variables. Both gender and cell type explained a substantial portion of the variance of the first two PCs, while disease phenotype explained a smaller fraction of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Disease phenotype explained the majority of the variance of PC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A and B</xref>). When the global DNA methylation status of these and other cell types in peripheral blood was compared in another study of similar design, PCA indicated that DNA methylation patterns differ more profoundly between cell types than between individuals (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These results, in combination with our findings, indicate that <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection affects DNA methylation in monocytes and granulocytes to a lesser extent than differences observed in cell type at the level of the global DNA methylome.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Methylation in professional phagocytes in latent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection (LTBI) and tuberculosis (TB) illustrating sources of variance in the methylation data following principal component analysis (PCA).

This set excluded (i) CpGs for which no link to functional genes had been established thus far and (ii) CpGs that were either hypermethylated or hypomethylated in every sample. The resulting filtered data set contained 80,198 CpG sites and showed an even more concise discrimination between genders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C and D</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the methylation profiles from 36 samples confirms gender differences in these two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1E</xref>). Thus, gender accounted for higher variation between individuals than TB disease phenotype in this data set. However, when the filtered set of CpGs was evaluated for differences between LTBI and TB, a clear distinction between groups was observed in PC5 and PC6 of the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>), suggesting that some of the epigenetic changes in monocytes and granulocytes were either the result or the cause of TB.</p><p>Second, differential analyses revealed &#x0003c;1% of the CpGs in the filtered set to be statistically differentially methylated between TB and LTBI (Wilcoxon <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). Of these, the CpGs showing most differentially methylated targets occurred in CpG islands and shores (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1C</xref> in the supplemental material). We tested whether the effect of the disease phenotype was random by considering the predictive power of the methylated sites using a machine learning (ML) approach. The resulting models were significantly better than random at distinguishing TB from LTBI (area under the curve [AUC], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.92), with an overall error rate below 30%. Classification between cell types yielded no errors (AUC, 1.00).</p><p>As can be expected following PCA, the relative abundances of differential methylation between monocytes and granulocytes within the same individual were much larger (~20% [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref>]). This confirms a previous study reporting 22% of CpGs to be differentially methylated between these two cell types (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the functional role of CpGs with methylation differences between LTBI and TB, we tested enrichment in functional categories of the genes associated with differentially methylated CpGs. BTMs for which the differences between LTBI and TB were significantly enriched resemble a tentative signature/fingerprint with CpGs either hyper- or hypomethylated in LTBI compared to TB within five known functional modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>). Of particular interest are four CpGs found to be differentially methylated in the &#x0201c;MHC-TLR7-TLR8 cluster,&#x0201d; which all occur in CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref>). While the CpGs associated with HLA-DQB1 (coding for one HLA class II chain) did not reside in a promoter-associated area of the gene, the other three CpGs associated with HLA-F and coding for HLA class I were all located within the promoter. Moreover, these two HLA-related genes to which these CpGs have bearing had opposite effects when LTBI and TB were compared: CpGs for HLA-DQB1 were significantly hypermethylated in TB patients compared to their paired LTBI samples, while CpGs at three different loci in the promoter of HLA-F were hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Functional association of statistically significant differentially methylated CpGs.

This resonates with reports (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) indicating that <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> interferes with antigen processing and presentation. Interestingly, an immunogenic peptide from <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> is presented by HLA-DQB1, and some HLA-DQB1 alleles associated with TB sensitivity present such peptides resulting in suboptimal antigen-specific interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) secretion by CD4 T cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This underlines the relevance of methylation of disease-related MHC-II alleles and warrants further investigation. On the other hand, HLA-F, which has been associated with tumor invasiveness (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and immune suppression (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), was hypomethylated in TB compared to LTBI-matched individuals. This, along with hypermethylated HLA-DQB1, may result in immune modulation to favor the pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s1.2"><title>Global expression of transcripts and miRs.</title><p>Transcriptomic data from the four experimental groups can be clearly distinguished according to gene expression profiles, with differences between cell types dominating over differences between study groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2A</xref> in the supplemental material). PCA revealed that 33% of the overall variance in the data corresponded to PC1, which was correlated with the two cell types. A further 14% of the variance is explained by PC2 and PC5, which correlate with TB. We have trained ML models to distinguish TB from LTBI and, independently, the two cell types. TB could be distinguished from LTBI with few errors (AUC, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.00), while there were no errors in classification of the cell types.</p><p>Second, both cell types showed a number of significantly differentially expressed genes between LTBI and TB (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table&#x000a0;S3</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). Pairwise comparisons between monocytes and granulocytes as well as between the LTBI and TB groups demonstrated a substantial response to TB in both cell types, as well as marked differences between these cell types in both LTBI and TB samples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3B</xref> in the supplemental material), as can be seen on the PCA plot (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3C</xref>). PC1 corresponded to differences between monocytes and granulocytes and was enriched in &#x0201c;mitochondrial and translation-related&#x0201d; genes, and PC2 and PC5 corresponded to differences between LTBI and TB samples.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies, TB patients showed a significant increase in expression of several genes identified as relevant in previous studies (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These include significant upregulation of CD64 (Fc-&#x003b3; receptor IA), and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) in TB. In granulocytes, we found a higher expression in TB for several MHC-II-related genes, including the CD74, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DMB genes. While the expression of these genes was significantly lower in granulocytes than in monocytes, no differences between LTBI and TB were apparent in monocytes.</p><p>Differential transcription analysis between LTBI and TB followed by functional analysis revealed several BTMs that were statistically significantly enriched for among differentially expressed genes (<italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>). Notably, the BTM designated &#x0201c;B cell surface signature&#x0201d; was significantly enriched on both the methylation and transcription levels. Likewise, transcriptional differences between monocytes and granulocytes were coherent with the corresponding module enrichments in the methylation data set (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">Table&#x000a0;S4</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). The responses to TB in monocytes and granulocytes were largely similar in the mRNA data set. The overall Pearson correlation coefficient between the log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes in monocytes and granulocytes was 0.42 (<italic>q</italic> ~ 0).

Gender played a far less significant role than DNA methylation. The separation between LTBI and TB was less clear in the PCA for mRNA. The random forest ML models showed high performance both for separation of TB from LTBI samples (1 error; AUC, 1.00) and monocytes from granulocytes (no errors; AUC, 1.00).</p><p>Several miRs were significantly differently expressed between LTBI and TB in both cell types as well as in one cell type (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS5">Table&#x000a0;S5</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). One such example is miR-146a-5p (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A</xref> in the supplemental material), for which the largest relative upregulation was in monocytes from LTBI compared to TB.

We have validated this result using a TaqMan miR real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4B</xref>).</p><p>Of note is the relatively large fraction of variance explained by gender in the full data set of DNA methylation as opposed to those for mRNA and miR. Transcripts such as mRNA and miR have a very short half-life. Therefore, changes in transcription rate rapidly affect the number of transcripts, which in turn causes a relatively high baseline variation due to rapid change in regulatory signals. Relative to this high baseline variation in transcripts, the contribution of gender to the total variation will be small. On the other hand, DNA methylation is a biochemically stable modification that results in markedly less baseline variation than that in mRNA and miR transcripts.</p><p>DNA methylation at CpGs had been documented repeatedly to be influenced by gender (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), not only on X and Y chromosomes but also CpGs on autosomal genes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Moreover, DNA methylation patterns are thought to be established largely during early embryonic development and then stably propagated via mitosis.</p><p>Since the samples for this study were collected from adult participants, we can expect to see a relatively small contribution to variation by gender compared to the large baseline variation in transcript data sets but a relatively high contribution of variation by gender against the low baseline variation in the DNA methylation set.</p></sec><sec id="s1.3"><title>Phagocyte proteomics during active TB.</title><p>To shed light on the relationship between active disease and protein synthesis in professional phagocytes, we measured the relative abundances for 3,047 unique proteins and an additional 429 isoforms.

To test whether, in general, distinct methylation sites were correlated with expression of corresponding genes, we calculated row-wise correlation coefficients between CpG methylation sites and the corresponding genes (83,562 CpG gene pairs in total). The distribution of these correlation coefficients was significantly different from those of randomly paired genes and methylation sites (<italic>P</italic> ~ 0 in a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).</p><p>We then focused on genes for which expression was strongly correlated with methylation of related CpG sites by investigating which BTMs contained such genes. In other words, for each functional group (BTM), we interrogated whether the expression of genes included in that functional group was, on average, correlated with the methylation of sites linked to that gene.</p><p>Toward this end, we tested for BTMs in which gene expression was strongly correlated with methylation of the linked CpG sites. First, we calculated correlation coefficients between values of methylation or expression for each pair of a CpG and a corresponding gene. Then, for each BTM, we performed a randomization test to determine whether the average correlation coefficient per BTM was significantly different from a random set of correlation coefficients. The existence of a correlation between the absolute methylation values and gene expression does not necessarily mean that a regulation of gene expression by differential methylation is relevant for the TB disease process. Therefore, we further calculated the correlation coefficients of paired differences in methylation/expression between LTBI and TB in monocytes and granulocytes, as well as between monocytes and granulocytes in LTBI and TB. We found that for 39 BTMs, the average correlation coefficients for the genes in that module were significantly different from 0 (at <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in a randomization test.

However, the complexity of gene expression regulation is greatly simplified in approaches where only the transcriptome of a mixture of cells is analyzed. We dissected a fragment of regulation of transcriptomic changes in professional phagocytes of TB patients, elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms and paths of gene regulation. For the first time, parallel analysis of the DNA methylome, transcriptome (mRNA and miR), and proteome revealed disease-specific changes permeating these levels of regulation, commencing with methylation marks on the DNA. We demonstrate that methylation events can distinguish TB disease from healthy, infected LTBI in this sample set. These events are functionally related to unique immune-relevant classes and are manifested on both transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Although the low number of samples constrained our investigation to general effects rather than specific regulatory mechanisms, this study paves the way for further detailed investigations that interrogate the DNA methylome and proteome in addition to the transcriptome of TB patients. These future investigations would necessarily entail also the analysis of professional phagocytes in healthy subjects neither latently infected nor with active TB, allowing a comparison and biomarker identification between the two healthy groups. Whether the observed differences from each of the platforms as well as the correlated platforms will be appreciated in a large sample set representative of a population remains to be shown. We cannot ascertain whether the observed changes in methylation causally contribute to risk of TB and whether the altered methylation patterns are a cause or effect of disease. Given that the differences observed in the DNA methylome are related to functional differences observed in both transcriptome and proteome, we suggest that studying the epigenome can bring us closer to defining biomarkers of predisposition to disease, as well as uniquely contribute to our understanding of TB pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics statement.</title><p>Blood samples (20&#x000a0;ml) were collected from participants following written consent (ethical approval from Stellenbosch University N10/08/274).</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Clinical procedures and sample isolation.</title><p>Samples from patients diagnosed with active TB (<italic>n =</italic> 8) and LTBI participants (<italic>n =</italic> 8) were obtained from an area of high TB endemicity in Cape Town, South Africa (Ravensmead and Uitsig), conforming to International Conference on Harmonisation good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) procedures.

Total RNA (tRNA), genomic DNA (gDNA), and protein were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Corporation) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

Each peptide sample was analyzed on a Thermo Easy-nLC 1000 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system connected to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer, which was equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific).

Mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000, and tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap at normal scan speed following collision-induced dissociation of the 10 most abundant precursors per cycle (normalized collision energy, 35%). We performed label-free quantification (LFQ) using Progenesis 4.0 (Nonlinear Dynamics) by automatic alignment of total ion chromatograms of raw files, using imported pep.xml files from Sequest searches against the human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database.
