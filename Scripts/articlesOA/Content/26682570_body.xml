<sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>With an estimated 9.6&#x000a0;million new cases annually, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the major threats to global health (World Health Organization, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). A major obstacle to both controlling the spread of the disease and improving treatment outcome is the lack of efficient clinical tools for rapid and accurate diagnosis. New diagnostics could reduce TB incidence rates by 13&#x02013;42%, with nucleic acid amplification tests preventing 23% of TB&#x02010;related deaths in the Southeast Asian region (Abu&#x02010;Raddad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Despite the broad extent of clinical experience with TB disease, a substantial proportion of new cases are mis&#x02010; or undiagnosed, with diagnosis largely relying on detection of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) pathogen in sputum using smear microscopy, culture, or molecular techniques (Pai &#x00026; Schito, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In cases where sputum smear results are negative or when sputum samples cannot be obtained, cases of active TB remain recalcitrant to diagnosis (Norbis <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p><p>In order to explore the molecular mechanisms of TB infection and to discover potential diagnostic biomarkers, global gene expression profiles in peripheral blood have been investigated (Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Over the past decade, a substantial number of RNA transcriptional profiling studies harnessing microarray&#x02010;based technologies have been published, identifying clusters of genes that are differentially expressed between TB patients and healthy individuals (Weiner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Most of these studies show highly consistent gene expression patterns that can be used to classify TB patients from healthy controls. For example, Berry <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> (<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) described a whole&#x02010;blood 393&#x02010;transcript signature for detection of active TB and a specific 86&#x02010;transcript signature that can discriminate active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. More recently, Kaforou <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> (<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) detected a 44&#x02010;transcript signature that can distinguish TB from other diseases and a 27&#x02010;transcript signature that distinguishes TB from latent TB infection (LTBI). The latter study also included TB patients from both HIV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and HIV<sup>+</sup> populations. Bloom <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> (<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) described a 144&#x02010;transcript signature that could distinguish TB from other pulmonary diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancer.</p><p>However, with signatures comprising dozens or hundreds of genes, and the prohibitive cost and expertise required to use microarray technology in the clinic, particularly in resource&#x02010;poor settings, no diagnostic tools for TB based on gene expression have so far been developed. In contrast to microarray technologies, modern real&#x02010;time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT&#x02013;PCR)&#x02010;based tools have several advantages for clinical use, being fast, cheap, easy to use, and requiring minimal electric power. Although molecular assays have their drawbacks for routine diagnosis as compared to more basic laboratory tests, RT&#x02013;PCR assays are widely approved for detection of influenza viruses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm</ext-link>) and have been extensively developed over recent years for diagnosis of several diseases caused by bacteria (Maurin, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Moreover, modern microfluidics technologies have enabled the design of &#x0201c;lab&#x02010;on&#x02010;a&#x02010;chip&#x0201d; systems for RT&#x02013;PCR detection of viral infections (Lee <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Song <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Additionally, because of its simplicity and rapidity, another amplification technique known as loop&#x02010;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP; Notomi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) is also applied to detection of, for example, pathogenic microorganisms (Fu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). We envisage that with such technologies, a new tool for diagnostic triage of TB patients is also in reach.</p><p>In order to develop such a tool, a small signature of genes that can robustly discriminate TB patients from healthy individuals is required. Here we describe the identification of such a small size gene signature that can discriminate TB patients from healthy individuals with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we designed a targeted RT&#x02013;PCR array based on two microarray datasets from a South African and a Gambian TB cohort previously generated by our group (Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">b</xref>) and then applied it to a new Indian cohort to generate expression data for training and testing validation of TB classifier models. We used two tree&#x02010;based methods to generate models for TB classification, namely random forest (RF) and conditional inference (CI) trees. We applied a stepwise approach to define a small top set of classifier genes that finally resulted in a minimally sized signature of only four genes that could successfully discriminate TB patients from healthy controls. For validation, we carried out RT&#x02013;PCR of this signature and measured its classification performance on two separate African cohorts. Furthermore, using independent publicly available blood transcription microarray datasets (Berry <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Bloom <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Kaforou <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Dawany <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), we demonstrate that our signature is capable of distinguishing between TB and other pulmonary and inflammatory diseases, across platforms and genetic backgrounds. Our use of RT&#x02013;PCR readout in this new dataset&#x000a0;allowed us to show that specific primer pairs for these genes have adequate dynamic range and so are appropriate for use in a diagnostic setting. These genes provide proof of principle for the development of a simple diagnostic point&#x02010;of&#x02010;care test in TB.</p></sec><sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0003"><title>RT&#x02013;PCR array and cohort design</title><p>In this study, we aimed to identify a minimal set of genes that could be implemented into a clinical tool for point&#x02010;of&#x02010;care testing for TB. Since nucleic acid amplification techniques are readily applied in standard diagnostic settings, we evaluated the discriminatory power of a selected set of genes to distinguish between TB patients and healthy individuals using a targeted RT&#x02013;PCR validation strategy. Based on previously published microarray datasets from South Africa and The Gambia (Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">b</xref>), we selected a set of 360 target genes that show strong differential expression between TB patients and healthy controls. From a cohort in Bangalore, India, a total of 200 peripheral blood RNA samples were collected from 120 TB patients and 80 healthy donors (60 LTBI and 20 uninfected). This new set of samples served as the primary source of data to evaluate the selected genes and to validate small gene sets for classification.</p><p>Gene expression levels for the selected target genes plus 12 reference genes were analyzed using a custom RT&#x02013;PCR array. To maintain a balanced design with a 3:2 ratio of TB patients to healthy controls, 60 patient and 40 control samples were randomly assigned into a training set, with the remaining samples being retained as validation set.</p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the normalized gene expression levels to inspect the variation in the dataset. The results indicate that the gene expression differences between TB patients and healthy controls constitute the majority of the variance within the dataset as indicated by their separation in the first two principal components (<xref rid="emmm201505790-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix&#x000a0;Fig S1</xref>). For training and testing of machine learning models for disease&#x02010;state classification, we randomly assigned 60 patient and 40 control samples to a training set, maintaining the ratio of 3:2 of the whole dataset. The remaining samples were retained as a test set.</p><p>The overall sample assignment and analysis steps applied in this study were as follows: (i) training set used to generate models and test them on the test set, (ii) determine optimal biosignature sizes and model training approaches, (iii) merge test and training set to maximize model performance, (iv) test full models using internal cross&#x02010;validation, (v) test full models on qPCR data from external cohorts, and (vi) test full models on independent (microarray) data (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="emmm201505790-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sample and analysis flowchart</title><p>All samples from TB patients and healthy controls were quality controlled and randomly assigned into a training and test set.

Within each iteration, models based on varying numbers of the top genes (from 1 to 100 genes) were tested for their performance in a 25&#x02010;fold cross&#x02010;validation on the training set only. The resulting classification performance of models based on increasing numbers of genes was discerned using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. We found that the number of genes within a model did not have a dramatic effect upon the classification performance over a large range of genes tested (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that only a limited set of top&#x02010;ranking genes already suffices for a high classification performance while additional genes do not significantly add more power to the performance of the models.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="emmm201505790-fig-0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Model size and performance</title><p>Classification performance of varying numbers of top&#x02010;ranking genes in RF models built and cross&#x02010;validated on the training set.

Generating 25 replicates of an RF model on the whole dataset we counted how many times each gene was among the most important predictors. Twelve genes ranked within the top 15 in all RF models (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Variable importance (mean decrease in Gini coefficient) for each gene was used as a measure for its predictive importance in partitioning the samples into the defined groups (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). In this context it thus means that a gene with a higher variable importance plays a greater role in predicting whether a sample is from a TB patient or a healthy individual. Below the top 12 genes, the importance measure shows a break&#x02010;off point. The relative expression distributions of these top classifier genes showed mostly higher expression levels in TB patients (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C).

It is also interesting that a smaller number of genes can also achieve a high level of predictive power. However, in order to not lose sensitivity by including too few genes at this stage of the performance testing, we chose to initially use a 15&#x02010;gene RF model to run on the test set (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The classification performance of this model on the test set returned an AUC as high as 0.98 (CI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.97&#x02013;1.0), documenting the model's high overall performance. Testing two other models based on 10 and 5 genes returned comparable high performance results, with AUCs 0.98 (CI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.96&#x02013;1.0) and 0.97 (CI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.94&#x02013;1.0), respectively (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>Whereas random forests can output a list of genes ordered by their importance as classifiers, CI trees output a set of top predictor genes, a single simple decision tree and also have the advantage of generating easily interpretable predictor values. Intriguingly, running such a CI decision tree on samples in the training set resulted in a very small set of only three genes. Calculation of the classification power of these genes on the test set RT&#x02013;PCR data gave a performance of AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.95 (95% CI: 0.90&#x02013;0.99).</p></sec><sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0005"><title>Models based on full RT&#x02013;PCR dataset</title><p>In the following step, we merged the training and tests sets from the Indian cohort to generate models to be tested both using internal cross&#x02010;validation, and by applying them to external datasets.</p><p>Since large training sets usually provide better classification power, we also evaluated a 15&#x02010;gene signature built on the whole 189 sample dataset (both training and test sets; <xref rid="emmm201505790-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix&#x000a0;Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>). The new model arising from this whole&#x02010;dataset RF classification analysis contained largely the same genes as the one based on the original 100&#x02010;sample training set. Ranked genes within this 15&#x02010;gene classification signature are given in <xref rid="emmm201505790-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix&#x000a0;Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>.

There was no difference in the classification power of this signature when separating controls into LTBI and uninfected individuals (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" specific-use="collapsible" id="emmm201505790-fig-0002ev" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure EV2</label><caption><title>Classification performance of models</title><p>ROC curves showing the performance of the 15&#x02010; and 4&#x02010;gene models built on the combined training and test datasets.

Classification power was the same for predicting TB from LTBI or uninfected healthy controls (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.98 for both (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>)). A graphical display of the CI decision tree (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) also illustrates the advantage of easily interpretable predictor values generated by this CI decision tree. For example, samples showing a &#x02206;C<italic>t</italic> value lower or equal to &#x02212;4.1 for GBP1 and higher than 5.9 for ID3 are most likely from healthy individuals, whereas those showing &#x0003e;&#x000a0;&#x02212;4.1 for GBP1, &#x0003e;&#x000a0;6.7 for P2RY14 and &#x0003e;&#x000a0;&#x02212;3.5 for IFITM3 almost certainly originate from TB patients. The excellent classification performance of this 4&#x02010;gene model indicates that very small gene signatures can have very high predictive power. However, to determine if these gene models are of broad application, we validated these gene models on independent datasets as well.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="emmm201505790-fig-0004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Conditional inference tree built on the whole dataset</title><p>Decision tree for the 4&#x02010;gene signature was built using ctree function from the party package in R.

Indeed, in distinguishing TB from ODs, the 4&#x02010;gene set performed well and surprisingly even outperformed the 15&#x02010;gene set on several other pulmonary diseases (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>). This is probably due to the fact that using a larger gene set results in the inclusion of more genes that are related to general inflammation, creating a larger overlap with expression profiles in non&#x02010;TB inflammatory ODs. The Bloom dataset (Bloom <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) contains individuals with other pulmonary diseases (sarcoidosis (SARC), lung cancer and pneumonia) and the Maertzdorf dataset (Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) includes TB and SARC patients. The 4&#x02010;gene model performed very well in distinguishing TB from pneumonia and lung cancer, but performed less well in distinguishing TB from SARC in the Bloom dataset (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.72) (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>). In contrast, TB could not be distinguished from SARC in the Maertzdorf dataset&#x000a0;although this could be due in part to the small number of samples. Alternatively, the Bloom dataset&#x000a0;also included non&#x02010;active SARC patients, while the Maertzdorf dataset only contained SARC patients with active disease status. The Kaforou dataset included multiple ODs where TB was initially considered in the differential diagnosis; here our 4&#x02010;gene model performed reasonably well, even in an HIV&#x02010;co&#x02010;infected population (both AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.71).

The ability to diagnose TB rapidly is imperative for combating this deadly disease as prompt diagnosis improves treatment outcomes and also prevents prolonged spread. An estimated 13&#x02013;42% reduction in TB incidence cases could be achieved by implementing new diagnostic methods (Abu&#x02010;Raddad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>).</p><p>We have identified a number of top classifier genes and a minimally sized signature with high classification power, which provides excellent gene candidates for inclusion in a diagnostic point&#x02010;of&#x02010;care test in endemic regions. Our signatures are capable of distinguishing TB patients from healthy individuals with very high accuracy on a RT&#x02013;PCR validation set. We consider this validation on RT&#x02013;PCR a key part of our results, since it proves that small triage gene sets work in a simple RT&#x02013;PCR setup. Such a platform could be integrated in a clinical setting, for example using a small gene&#x02010;chip device, something that is not possible with complex microarray platforms.</p><p>For a true external validation, we tested the performance of our signature by an RT&#x02013;PCR&#x02010;based platform in two separate populations from The Gambia and Uganda. Depending on the chosen cutoff point, these validations reached sensitivity scores up to 87% and with a specificity around 75%. Due to technical differences between sites and varying gene expression levels between ethnic populations, optimal cutoff settings could thus vary between different locations. Calibration of equipment in different settings would therefore probably predefine different cutoff points for different cohorts or geographical regions. Moreover, defining the desired cutoff is mostly a clinical decision, whether the TB predictive power should yield high sensitivity (with lower specificity) or whether higher specificity would be preferred (at the cost of sensitivity).</p><p>Overall, the 4&#x02010;gene model displayed the best performance, with similar AUCs to the 15&#x02010;gene model for discriminating between TB patients and healthy individuals, but far better performance when other diseases were considered. This small set of four genes consisted of GBP1, IFITM3, P2RY14 and ID3. Both GBP1 and IFITM3 are interferon&#x02010;induced genes, corresponding to the strongly upregulated interferon signatures observed in TB patients (Berry <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, these genes are not in the same gene modules as defined by Chaussabel &#x00026; Baldwin (<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), indicating that transcriptional profiles of GBP1 and IFITM3 are probably not highly correlated. The other two genes are not known to be specifically involved in infectious diseases, although P2RY14, a G&#x02010;protein&#x02010;coupled receptor with diverse physiological roles, has been implicated in the modulation of immune function (Scrivens and Dickenson, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). ID3 is a T lymphocyte associated transcriptional regulator (Naito <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Note that three genes within this 4&#x02010;gene signature, with the exception of IFITM3, are among the top 12 classifier genes as defined in Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and were also present in our 15&#x02010;gene model (IFITM3 ranked at position 47 of most important predictors in the RF model on which our 15&#x02010;gene signature was based). We presume that this is due to the fact that several of the top&#x02010;ranking genes have correlated expression patterns. Therefore, the combination of genes that results in a good classification model does not necessarily need to correspond to the top&#x02010;ranking predictor genes.</p><p>While this study was not set up with the aim to discriminate TB from other diseases, we nevertheless discovered that our 4&#x02010;gene signature could distinguish such cases with very high AUCs for some diseases (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="emmm201505790-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref> and Fig <xref rid="emmm201505790-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>), better or equal to the published transcriptome signatures. Within the Kaforou, Berry and Bloom datasets (Berry <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Bloom <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Kaforou <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) our 4&#x02010;gene signature was also able to distinguish TB from other adult pulmonary diseases, as well as non&#x02010;pulmonary bacterial diseases, systemic inflammatory diseases and including pediatric patients. Our 4&#x02010;gene signature performed especially well in distinguishing TB from pneumonia and lung cancer. Our signatures failed, however, to distinguish between TB and sarcoidosis in our own, relatively small, dataset (Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), but did show some classification power within the Bloom dataset (Bloom <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). This was not surprising, since these two pulmonary diseases are clinically, pathologically and immunologically highly similar despite their distinct etiologies. However, due to the relatively low prevalence of sarcoidosis in TB&#x02010;endemic regions (Babu, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), this overlap will not markedly influence the use of our signatures in possible future diagnosis of TB.</p><p>Indeed, the top&#x02010;ranking genes in our classification signatures appear to mainly reflect host pathology and are not necessarily specific for TB. However, we find that our small signature does discriminate some other pulmonary diseases with high accuracy, despite not being based on data from such diseases. Indeed, the 4&#x02010;gene signature performed remarkably better than the extended 15&#x02010;gene set, likely due to the fact that the larger gene set included more general inflammatory signatures, leading to a higher overlap in gene expression profiles with other inflammatory diseases.</p><p>We would like to re&#x02010;emphasize that our study was initially set up to classify TB patients from healthy individuals, and not for differential diagnosis of suspected disease. In our opinion, a simple &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; signature that would be able to distinguish TB from healthy and, at the same time, differentially diagnose TB from other (pulmonary) diseases is unlikely to emerge. We rather envision an easy two parallel signature setup that when (i) the signature classifying healthy from probable TB tests positive, then (ii) a second differential diagnosis signature (yet to be defined) would distinguish TB from other diseases.</p><p>A similar effort to identify diagnostic gene expression signatures for TB has recently been published (Satproedprai <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). A smaller cohort of TB patients and healthy controls compared to the one presented here (78 samples compared to 200 samples), and a smaller set of genes (13 compared to 360 here) were evaluated by RT&#x02013;PCR. In this study, gene expression levels were used to calculate a &#x0201c;TB sick score&#x0201d; to predict TB. The selected genes could distinguish TB patients from healthy controls within their cohort, but the signature was not validated on an independent cohort. Moreover, while the selected genes were among the differentially expressed genes identified by Berry <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> (<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), they were not within the 86 TB&#x02010;specific transcript set. Accordingly, discrimination of TB from other diseases may not be possible with the signature of Satproedprai <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> (<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), although this remains to be tested.</p><p>Overall, we demonstrate in an exploratory setup, proof of concept that small sets of genes like our 4&#x02010;gene signature can offer excellent classification performance in an easily implemented RT&#x02013;PCR setup. Therefore, these gene sets could be used for a potential future point&#x02010;of&#x02010;care screening of active TB patients. We believe that such a limited set of genes could soon be implemented in a tool for large&#x02010;scale diagnostic validation in endemic regions to test its potential to diagnose active TB. Although such a new test will not immediately replace existing diagnostics like sputum smear culture and GeneXpert (Boehme <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), proof of principle is provided here that simple and rapid RT&#x02013;PCR&#x02010;based tests can help to classify TB patients.</p></sec><sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0009"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0010"><title>Study design</title><p>A prespecified total of 200 adult participants (120 TB patients and 80 healthy donors) were recruited at St. John's hospital in Bangalore, India. Inclusion criteria for patients were cases of newly diagnosed&#x000a0;active TB, confirmed by a positive GeneXpert sputum test (Boehme <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and treatment not yet initiated. Healthy control individuals showed no symptoms or signs of active TB and were age and gender matched to the recruited TB patients. Exclusion criteria were subjects under 18&#x000a0;years of age or over 60, HIV<sup>+</sup> status, and individuals on treatment for TB at the time of recruitment or having received such treatment within the last 12&#x000a0;months. Healthy control individuals were recruited among local healthcare workers and tested for LTBI by skin test and IGRA test (Quantiferon&#x02010;TB). 29% of skin test&#x02010;negative individuals were tested IGRA<sup>+</sup>, while 15% of skin test&#x02010;positives tested IGRA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. LTBI individuals were defined based on positive skin test to match the definition for latency in the other validation cohorts.

Low quality RNA samples were excluded from the study (seven samples with A260/280 &#x0003c;&#x000a0;1.6). For this validation study, 360 target genes were selected based on our previously published microarray datasets from South Africa and The Gambia, using a ranking strategy based on the original analysis and RF variable importance (Maertzdorf <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">b</xref>). Gene expression of these targets plus 12 reference genes was determined using a custom 384 well RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler RT&#x02013;PCR array (Qiagen). Samples were randomly assigned to a training set of 60 TB cases and 40 controls, maintaining the study design's 3:2 ratio of TB patients to controls. The remaining samples were assigned to a separate test set. No predefined analysis protocol was used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="emmm201505790-sec-0011"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The entire raw dataset was evaluated for quality control. Genes with C<italic>t</italic> values &#x0003e;&#x000a0;32 in at least 40% samples in both TB and control groups, and more than 50% of the samples in either group were dismissed. These genes were considered to have an extremely low expression level and therefore not useful for diagnostic&#x02010;level classification and excluded from the analysis. This resulted in a final set of 281 genes. The stability of the reference genes was evaluated with the Bioconductor geNorm analysis R package NormqPCR (Perkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="emmm201505790-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).

We ran both these methods on the training sets and then built models based on the top genes to run on the test set. We also ran both these methods on our entire dataset (training and validation sets combined) as larger datasets can provide more accurate predictions. All models were subsequently cross&#x02010;validated on the full RT&#x02013;PCR dataset and independently validated on RT&#x02013;PCR data from two external cohorts (see <xref rid="emmm201505790-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix&#x000a0;Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> for number of patients and controls) and on five independent, publicly available gene expression (microarray) datasets.

These controls were used to obtain medians and interquartile ranges for each gene in the set, and all samples from each dataset were standardized with these values. Next, RF models were trained on the normalized RT&#x02013;PCR data and applied to the normalized microarray samples.
