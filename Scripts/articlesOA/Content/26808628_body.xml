<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Unlike immune responses against most infections, the response against persisting viruses rapidly becomes dysfunctional and unable to purge infection. The prolonged virus replication progressively induces a deterioration of the T cell response, a phenomenon termed exhaustion [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. T cell exhaustion involves a specific molecular and metabolic program, functionally characterized by altered cytokine production in conjunction with decreased proliferative capacity and cellular cytotoxicity. Importantly, the restoration of exhausted T cell functions can lead to the control of a persistent virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], suggesting that overcoming immunosuppression is a potent path to control persistent virus infections. Similar parameters of immune dysfunction are observed during many persistently viremic infections including, HIV, HBV and HCV infection in humans, SIV in monkeys and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, indicating that persisting viral replication initiates a conserved immune differentiation program across different species of pathogen and host [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that drive immunosuppression and how to overcome them will be critical to restore and then maintain immune-mediated control of persistent virus infections.</p><p>Many of the suppressive factors that negatively regulate the T cell response are being identified and their modulation is revolutionizing medicine. However, we still know surprisingly little about the mechanisms that induce, regulate and sustain the expression of the suppressive factors themselves and the cell types that express them in chronic disease. In response to viral persistence, the host initiates an immunosuppressive program through factors such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) that actively suppress antiviral T cell responses and facilitate persistent infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Importantly, we demonstrated that many cell types are capable of producing IL-10 and PDL1 during persistent infection and it is likely that all these work in combination and in their specific niches to establish the overall suppressive environment and inhibition of the antiviral response [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In an effort to understand how the suppressive factors are regulated, we identified distinct populations of immunoregulatory (ireg) antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages that simultaneously express multiple inhibitory factors to suppress T cell responses (e.g. IL-10, PDL1, PDL2, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase, IDO) [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A different population of macrophages was recently identified in persistent LCMV infection resembling the myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) observed in cancer [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, these MDSC-like cells were distinct from DC and macrophages we identified and did not express IL-10 or PDL-1. Considering the fundamental role of IL-10 and PDL1 in suppressing T cells and limiting immune mediated control of persistent virus infection, the concentration of these factors onto specific iregAPC subsets indicates a mechanism to deliver multiple potent inhibitory signals to T cells in a single interaction; and as such, these iregAPC represent a centralized node of immunosuppressive signals.</p><p>Counter to immunosuppression, persistent virus infections are also characterized by chronic production of pro-inflammatory factors that associated with worsened disease progression [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Yet, how these two seemingly opposed pro- and anti-inflammatory programs co-exist and regulate each other is not well understood. We recently established a link between chronic type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, immune suppression and viral persistence [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Simultaneous with its critical antiviral role, IFN-I signaling led to a surprising amount of the immune dysfunctions associated with viral persistence including expression of IL-10 and PDL1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Antibody blockade of the IFN-I receptor (IFNR) during persistent LCMV infection diminished the expression of IL-10 and PDL1, reversed many of the immune defects, and ultimately facilitated long-term virus control [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, in addition to its antiviral and immune stimulatory roles, IFN-I signaling also regulates multiple suppressive pathways and dysfunctions that facilitate viral persistence. Interestingly, many of the immune dysfunctions restored by blocking IFN-I signaling are also linked to IL-10 and PDL1, yet aside from the association, a mechanistic understanding of how IFN-I promotes IL-10 and PDL1 expression is lacking. In particular, whether IFN-I specifically leads to the genesis of cells that as part of their program produce IL-10 and PDL1 or whether IFN-I acts upon existing cells to endow them with suppressive activity. Herein we demonstrate that the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of DC with T cell suppressive potential and the induction of their immunosuppressive program is a collaboration between the interferon systems. First, IFN&#x003b3; is required to drive monocytes to differentiate into DC with suppressive potential and second; IFN-I targets these DC to directly induce the immunosuppressive factors IL-10 and PDL1. In parallel to induction of suppressive factors, IFN-I inhibits the emergence of DC with T cell stimulatory capacity, in essence shaping the immunosuppressive environment. Chronic IFN-I signaling, suppressive APC, immunosuppression and impaired T cell responses are not limited to persistent virus infections, but are also observed in other chronic diseases, including bacterial infections (e.g., <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>; <italic>Mtb</italic>) and cancer [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

</title><p>To explore the mechanisms underlying the generation and potentiation of immunosuppression during persistent virus infection, we used the LCMV model. Infection with the LCMV variant Clone 13 (Cl13) establishes a persistent infection due to increases in virus replication and receptor affinity that help to outcompete the developing immune response, thereby inducing immunosuppression and T cell exhaustion [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We first sought to determine the anatomical localization of IL-10 expressing cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and whether they localize to defined foci or are distributed throughout the tissue. Using IL-10 reporter mice[<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we observed that at day 9 after LCMV-Cl13 infection, IL-10 expressing cells were distributed throughout the red pulp and marginal zone of the spleen consistent with DC and macrophage localization of IL-10 at this time point during infection (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005356.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As infection progressed, the amount of IL-10 expressing cells decreased[<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but they were still largely observed in the red pulp and marginal zone, although there was also dispersal to other areas by this time (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Thus, as opposed to localized defined foci, IL-10 expressing cells are dispersed throughout the spleen and essentially form a &#x02018;blanket&#x02019; throughout the APC: T cell area during persistent virus infection.</p><fig id="ppat.1005356.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005356.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>

To overcome the reliance on IL-10 reporter mice, we identified a panel of markers increased on IL-10/PDL1 co-producing iregDC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). Compared to their stimDC counterparts, iregDC could be identified by their increased expression of CD95 (Fas) and CD39 (an ectoenzyme responsible for deactivating extracellular ATP [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) as well as high levels of pan-Caspase activity (including Casp1, but also other Caspases since high pan-Caspase activity is still observed in Caspase1-/- mice) (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>). Further, factors associated with phagocytosis and degradation such as CD172&#x003b1; and CD68, as well as CD73 that works in conjunction with CD39 to convert ATP to adenosine, were also increased on iregDC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). CD39+/CD95+ iregDCs expressed high levels of MHC and CD80/86 to interact with T cells, but unlike CD39-/CD95- stimDC that readily activated T cells and were not affected by anti-IL-10R or anti-PDL1 blockade, iregDC suppressed T cell activation in an IL-10 and PDL1 dependent manner (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). At day 30 after LCMV-Cl13 infection, the amount of IL-10 expressing iregDC decreased, but those that remained were still identified based on CD39 and CD95 expression (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Importantly, these markers could also be used to identify iregDC in LCMV-Cl13 infected Balb/c mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>), indicating that iregDC development is not C57BL/6 strain specific and establishing a panel of markers to distinguish suppressive DC without reporter mice.</p><p>To profile iregDC vs. stimDC molecularly, we performed RNA-seq analysis 9 days after persistent LCMV-Cl13 infection. Expression analysis indicated a large overlap between the two populations, with approximately 750 genes differentially expressed by 3-fold or more (assuming an RPKM cutoff of 2 in at least one of the samples) (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Interestingly ~150 genes were differentially expressed greater than 10-fold (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Gene ontology analysis indicated iregDC increased expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses, wound healing and phagocytosis/Fc receptor expression, while stimDCs were enriched for multiple pathways involved in cell cycle progression (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). These analyses further identified differential gene expression of key immunomodulatory cytokines, chemokines and T cell costimulatory molecules (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). iregDCs exhibited increased expression of T cell attracting chemokines [CXCL9 (RPKM 373) and CXCL10 (RPKM 582)] and monocyte attracting chemokines (CCL7, CCL8 and CCL12) which bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 (upregulated on iregDCs) and could serve to further attract iregDC to sites of inflammation (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Although expression of the costimulatory CD80 and CD86 proteins was similar on iregDCs and stimDCs (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), iregDC expressed decreased levels of multiple T cell costimulatory molecules that positively activate, modulate and sustain antiviral and antitumor T cell functions, including ICOSL, 4-1BBL, GITR and TACI and increased anti-inflammatory receptors, including Mertk and Axl (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Whereas WT iregDC expressed high levels of PDL1 and IL-10, IFN&#x003b1;R-/- iregDC (although present at the same amount) exhibited substantially decreased expression of PDL1 and IL-10 compared to WT mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting that although the generation of the cells with suppressive potential was not dependent on IFN-I signaling, IFN-I signaling is required for expression of their suppressive program. Interestingly, ireg phenotype DC that could not receive IFN-I signals lost their suppressive activity and now stimulated robust antiviral T cell responses similar to WT and IFN&#x003b1;R-/- stimDC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). In addition to a decrease in the overall amount of cells that divided, the substantial blockade of later cell divisions by WT iregDC (i.e., cells undergoing 3+ divisions) was not observed in IFN&#x003b1;R-/- iregDC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). CFSE dilution was calculated as described by Gett et al [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to accurately quantify the amount of divided cells. Thus, the expression of IL-10 and PDL1 by iregDC and their ability to subsequently suppress antiviral T cell responses is dependent on IFN-I signaling and in the absence of IFN-I, these otherwise suppressive DC now stimulate robust T cell responses.</p><p>To determine whether intrinsic IFN-I signaling was required for inducing the suppressive function by iregDC, we utilized 50:50 WT: IFN&#x003b1;R-/- bone marrow chimera mice wherein WT and IFN&#x003b1;R-/- cells are present within the same environment and exposed to the same signals. Interestingly, prior to infection, all subsets of WT cells analyzed except B cells were increased (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005356.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>), indicating that in competition, cells that cannot receive steady state IFN-I signals are hindered. Conversely, following LCMV-Cl13 infection, IFN&#x003b1;R-/- macrophages and particularly DCs were now present at much higher levels compared to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005356.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, IFN&#x003b1;R-/- CD4 T cells and B cells, two populations we have previously shown to be increased in IFN&#x003b1;R-/- mice and anti- IFN&#x003b1;R antibody treated mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], were not increased above their pre-infection levels following persistent infection of mixed bone marrow chimera mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>), indicating that their expansion in IFN&#x003b1;R-/- mice and anti- IFN&#x003b1;R antibody treated mice is not cell intrinsic. Similar to IFN&#x003b1;R-/- mice, the frequency of iregDC in mixed chimeras from the IFN&#x003b1;R-/- lineage was greatly reduced compared to WT cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). However, due to the advantage that IFN&#x003b1;R-/- DCs had compared to the WT DCs, there were numerically more IFN&#x003b1;R-/- iregDCs (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), again consistent with IFN-I being dispensable for iregDC generation. Further, the number of IFN&#x003b1;R-/- stimDCs were increased, indicating that the suppression of stimDCs is similarly directly mediated by IFN&#x003b1;R intrinsic signals. On the other hand, PDL1 expression was decreased on the IFN&#x003b1;R-/- iregDC in the mixed chimera mice and IFN-I treatment significantly upregulated IL-10 expression by DC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>), indicating that IFN&#x003b1;R signaling directly induced suppressive factors on pre-existing cells. Thus, the immunosuppressive impact of IFN-I signaling is two pronged: IFN-I signaling limits the expansion of the stimDCs population while endowing the iregDC population with the capacity to generate immunosuppressive factors and repress antiviral T cell stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>iregDC and stimDC are ontologically distinct</title><p>Since IFN-I signaling induces the suppressive program that inhibits T cell activation, but not the choice to become iregDC, an unanswered question is why do some CD11b+ DCs become iregDCs while others become stimDCs since IL-10 expressing cells are dispersed throughout the tissue and therefore are all present in the same environment?

At day 9 after LCMV-Cl13 infection, iregDC expressed increased levels of the monocyte-associated proteins CCR2 (C-C chemokine receptor type 2) and Fc&#x003b3;RI (CD64) in conjunction with the other monocyte-associated proteins Fc&#x003b5;R1&#x003b1;, Fc&#x003b3;RII/III, and Ly6C (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). RNA-seq global transcriptional profiles further placed iregDC as an intermediate population between na&#x000ef;ve monocytes and DC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting monocyte differentiation into DC-like cells. Conversely, stimDCs exhibited a gene ontogeny profile similar to na&#x000ef;ve DC and expressed higher levels of the DC associated marker FLT3 and transcription factor Zbtb46 (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). As persistent infection progressed, the CD39+ and CD95+ iregDC continued to express the monocyte-associated proteins CCR2 and Fc&#x003b3;RI, although at this point many monocyte-derived DC were now not iregDC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), consistent with the decreased IL-10 and PDL1 at this time point (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

MAVS-/- mice exhibited an increased number of stimDC, without a change in the number of iregDCs or IL-10 expression (although a small decrease in PDL1 expression on iregDC in MAVS-/- mice was observed; <xref rid="ppat.1005356.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005356.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D Fig</xref>), suggesting that MAVS signaling is important for the suppression of stimDC during persistent virus infection, but with minimal effect on iregDC differentiation.

In this study we (1) identify the origin of suppressive DC during persistent virus infection; (2) define the divergent mechanisms that lead to their generation and functional programming; (3) demonstrate that these process are separable events; (4) demonstrate that in the absence of IFN-I signaling, otherwise suppressive DC now exhibit robust T cell stimulatory capacity; (5) link the immunosuppressive DC observed in persistent LCMV infection to other persistent diseases; and importantly, (6) clarify many of the questions and controversies concerning suppressive DCs in persistent virus infection.</p><p>There has existed a significant lack of understanding of how immunosuppressive DC are generated during persistent virus infection. To address this issue, we identified markers to categorize suppressive DC without relying on their suppressive functions for characterization and demonstrated that specifically monocytes and not conventional DC gave rise to immunosuppressive DC during persistent virus infection. Further, differentiation of monocytes into suppressive DC required a direct two-hit mechanism. As virus titers and inflammatory signals continue to rise, namely IFN&#x003b3;, monocytes differentiate into moDC. These moDC are generally considered pro-inflammatory [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], however, in the presence of continued IFN-I production during persistent infection, the inflammatory moDC are induced to express PDL1 and IL-10. In addition to their suppressive functions, iregDC also express high levels of T cell attracting and interacting molecules to draw-in, interact with and suppress T cell activity. Considering that both IFN&#x003b3; and IFN-I are generally thought of as antiviral and immune stimulatory during viral infection, our data now provide a new mechanistic understanding that integrally links inflammation to balance immunosuppression during persistent virus infections.</p><p>In parallel to inducing suppressive factors, IFN-I production suppresses the generation of T cell stimulating cDC, further compounding the suppressive environment. IFN-I can limit the amount of DCs able to egress from the bone marrow [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and our data indicate that this is through mechanisms distinct from those that lead to IFN-I mediated upregulation of IL-10 and PDL1 expression, in particular requiring MAVS-mediated signaling. The decrease in cDC is consistent with other persistent infections in which DC functionality is diminished and an immunosuppressive environment is established [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In fact, what is perceived as the diminished DC function may in part be due to a shift toward monocyte-derived iregDC that are phenotypically similar to cDC, but are suppressive instead of stimulatory. Thus, by directly driving immunosuppressive factors and an overall population inversion from stimulatory to suppressive DC, we provide mechanistic insight by which interferons and distinct pathogen recognition pathways collaborate to shift and shape the environment toward suppression during persistent infection.</p><p>Why some APCs become suppressive while others in the same environment do not has remained unclear. Both iregDC and stimDC express similar levels of IFN&#x003b1;R and in theory are both in the same inflammatory and IFN-I containing environment [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our data now shed light on this matter by indicating that certain DC precursors can serve as targets for IFN-I mediated IL-10 and PDL1 upregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Without the precursor moDC population induced by IFN&#x003b3;, IFN-I does not have the target cell available to induce IL-10 and PDL1, although IFN-I antiviral and immunostimulatory aspects would still be present. Our data can further help explain the tissue restriction of IL-10 and PDL1 expressing cells and T cell exhaustion to sites of infection or cancer induced inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the presence of IFN-I induced by inflammation, the precursor moDC are signaled toward an immunosuppressive program, whereas in distant sites, even if moDC are present, the lack of infection or tumor growth would not induce IFN-I, or as a result, suppressive APC. MyD88 and IFN&#x003b3; have also been shown to guide monocyte differentiation into DC in other inflammatory systems [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], suggesting the mechanisms underlying moDC differentiation are a conserved response to inflammation. Interestingly, although MyD88 was required for moDC generation during persistent LCMV infection, the requirements were indirect and MyD88 sensing of infection formed a foundation to induce expression of additional factors that then led to iregDC differentiation. Thus, multiple pathogen sensing steps are required to ultimately lead to the generation of suppressive DC and underscore the intricate dependence of ongoing inflammation and immunosuppression.</p><p>The ability of transferred monocytes to differentiate into iregDC at the beginning and during persistent infection suggests that their conversion is a continual process. The increased expression of CD95 and activated Caspases by iregDC would render them highly susceptible to apoptosis and rapid turnover. Interestingly, DCs lacking CD95 expression were recently observed to be more potent at sustaining the immune response during persistent LCMV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although in our studies iregDC expressed the highest amounts of CD95, the lack of CD95 on conventional DC may enable longer life of the conventional DC that are generated and thus, limit the stimDC to iregDC inversion. Together, these data suggest a mechanism to facilitate the highly tunable immunologic system to respond rapidly to changing inflammatory and pathogen environments.</p><p>Although many of the suppressive factors are known, an understanding of where and how the suppressive cells localize <italic>in vivo</italic> is limited. We show that instead of forming distinct foci of immunosuppression, IL-10 expressing cells are widely distributed throughout the red pulp and marginal zone of the spleen and ultimately are also observed in the B cell follicle consistent with temporally increasing IL-10 expression from T cells and B cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During persistent infection, T cells overlap with areas of high IL-10 expression in the spleen and are present throughout the red pulp and marginal zone during persistent LCMV infection (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). Importantly, McGavern and colleagues [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 T cell immune exhaustion in persistent LCMV infection maps to the red pulp/marginal zone of the spleen where these cells are engaged in prolonged contacts, again consistent with positioning them to interact with IL-10 producing cells. Loss of IL-10 specifically from CD11c expressing DC led to an overall decrease in IL-10 levels [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further, our observation that the main IL-10 producing DC are of monocyte origin and express high amounts of LysM (Lyz2; <xref rid="ppat.1005356.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) may suggest an underestimate of the contribution from IL-10 expressing DC in studies that use myeloid specific promoters (LysM-Cre) to delete IL-10 [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Considering the breadth of cell types that are able to produce IL-10 in response to persistent LCMV infection, it is likely that each work in their own microenvironments and in concert to contribute to the IL-10 induced immunosuppressive environment. Ultimately, it will be interesting to tease apart the individual contribution of each toward establishing and sustaining the immunosuppressive environment.</p><p>There has been controversy over whether direct productive infection of the DC is required to generate its IL-10 production [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Through multiple techniques, we demonstrate that IL-10, PDL1 and iregDC generation are not specifically dependent on direct infection or recognition of intracellular viral replication by the LCMV sensors TLR3 or MAVS. Although only a fraction of iregDCs were infected, it was interesting that iregDC (i.e., moDC) are the main source of DC infection, with minimal infection of conventional CD11b+ DC. Thus, although IL-10/PDL1 producing iregDC are the main DC subset infected, their infection is not required for induction of the immunosuppressive program. It is possible that the low levels of LCMV RNA present in the GFP- iregDC are sufficient to induce robust levels of IL-10 expression. However, in the absence of IFN-I signaling the amount of IL-10 RNA drops dramatically in DC (<xref rid="ppat.1005356.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), whereas the amount of infected DC increases [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is not consistent with direct infection triggering IL-10 production. It is further conceivable that direct infection drives the IFN-I that then is restricted to function through an autocrine fashion to increase IL-10. However, then it would be expected that only infected GFP+ cells would produce IL-10 and that IL-10 levels would directly correlate to a cells level of infection, which is not the case. On the other hand, MAVS-/- mice exhibit an increased amount of stimDC, similar to IFN&#x003b1;R-/- mice, suggesting that intracellular, MAVS recognition of LCMV replication is a critical step in the IFN-I mediated suppression of stimDC. Together, these data indicate that induction of IFN-I signaling orchestrates multiple aspects of immunosuppression through distinct mechanisms during persistent infection.</p><p>The identification of multiple markers that effectively differentiate IL-10/PDL1 producing suppressive iregDC from their stimulatory DC counterparts enabled analysis of their origin and generation in multiple chronic inflammatory diseases. It is important to note that PDL1 in combination with these other markers is a reasonable approach to identify iregDC in situations where IL-10 reporter mice cannot be used, and the use of PDL1 as an identifier of iregDC was only unusable when investigating the mechanisms that regulate PDL1 expression itself. Monocyte-derived iregDC phenotype cells specifically expressing suppressive factors were observed in <italic>Mtb</italic> and HIV infection, and cancer, suggesting that suppressive DC arise from a monocyte origin in multiple situations of chronic disease characterized by continually high antigen loads, inflammation (i.e., IFN&#x003b3;, IFN-I) and immunosuppression mediated by IL-10 and PDL1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005356.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Importantly, the monocyte origin of suppressive DC was also observed in human cells using a humanized mouse model of HIV infection, suggesting that similar cellular ancestries and mechanisms of induction can occur in human persistent virus infections. Ultimately, targeting these underlying mechanisms of chronic inflammation may provide a potent therapeutic strategy to simultaneously and specifically dampen immunosuppression at its foundation to bolster T cell responses to control multiple chronic infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health, and local policies in the review and approval of animal care and use protocols.
