Firstly, they demonstrate that it is feasible to conduct large-scale clinical efficacy trials of vaccines against TB in high-burden settings and in the target population. Secondly, the results raise several fundamental questions relevant to the whole field, which has stimulated debate and generated innovative proposals for the evaluation of TB vaccine candidates in the future.</p><p>It is now evident that the variable and modest efficacy seen in preclinical animal models was not able to predict protection in BCG-vaccinated infants or HIV-infected adults. Several reasons have been suggested to account for the disparity between the animal data and the outcomes of human efficacy trials.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p><p>Species differences that may influence the predictive ability of animal models exist.

Immunogenicity studies are needed to assess different immune responses at various ages.</p><p>Secondly, there are significant differences in the nature of exposure between animal challenge experiments and natural infection in humans. In the former, laboratory strains of <italic>M. tb</italic> are used in a single exposure via a variety of challenge routes and at much higher inocula than that seen in natural infection. However, humans are likely to experience multiple low dose exposures of clinical strains, with the establishment of infection following one or several of these exposures (or, indeed, not at all).<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> Recent evidence from a study assessing the protection of BCG and a novel candidate vaccine against newly emerging, mostly highly virulent, strains of <italic>M. tb</italic> has highlighted the importance of the fitness of prevalent strains of <italic>M. tb</italic> at clinical trial sites when trying to show vaccine efficacy.<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref></p><p>There is, therefore, a need to develop experimental models of infection more comparable to natural challenge.</p><p>Thirdly, there are fundamental differences in study power, definitions and endpoints. The MVA85A efficacy trial was powered to detect a 60% improvement over BCG, however the magnitude of candidate vaccine efficacy in animal models was much lower than this and would not have been detected in clinical trials.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,37</sup></xref> Also, the definition of protection varies between human and animal models. In animals, protective efficacy of a candidate vaccine is assessed in terms of improvement in the extent of disease using markers such as organ bacillary load, severity of pathology or time to death. In contrast, human trials define efficacy as the prevention of disease. Clearly, there is a fundamental difference between these endpoints, which lack intuitive correlation. It has been suggested that changing animal trial endpoints from TB disease reduction to disease prevention should be considered and, still further, possibly establishing animal challenge models to show prevention of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection rather than protection from disease, which may be a more feasible endpoint in human efficacy trials.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> However, limitations of this approach include the need to use much larger numbers of animals, and the lack of validated biomarkers of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection to correlate parameters in animal models with human efficacy data. As discussed later, while to date the focus of human efficacy trials has been prevention of disease, the low number of endpoints requires large clinical trials which are both expensive and time consuming. Recently there has been renewed interest in using prevention of infection as a measure of candidate vaccine efficacy which would provide more endpoints but presupposes that the underlying immune mechanisms of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection and disease are similar and highlights the limitations of diagnostics and the definition of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref></p><p>Finally, there are several other aspects of variation in human clinical trial settings that contrast with the laboratory, such as nutritional status and diet, exposure to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), helminth infection and the effect of host genetic heterogeneity on susceptibility. For example, several studies have shown poor BCG vaccine efficacy in human populations with high levels of prior exposure to environmental (NTM).<xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56-59</sup></xref> A recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that the absence of sensitization with NTM was associated with higher efficacy of BCG against pulmonary (and also possibly miliary and meningeal) TB.<xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> It has been suggested that pre-existing immunity to NTM results in either &#x02018;blocking&#x02019; the effects of BCG vaccination by inhibiting the replication of BCG and preventing the induction of protective immune responses or &#x02018;masking&#x02019; the effects as BCG is unable to further boost background immunity induced by NTM. In addition, chronic helminth infections may also have an modulatory effect on vaccine efficacy, causing a shift toward Th2-type immunity, impaired antigen-specific and Th1-type responses and the induction of regulatory T cells producing transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; and other inhibitory cytokines which suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines. These responses have been associated with reduced efficacy of BCG in endemic settings.<xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61-64</sup></xref></p><p>Fundamental questions that remain are what is the magnitude of improvement in animal challenge models needed to predict the significant improvement in protection required in humans and which immunological parameters have the greatest predictive power for vaccine efficacy? Recent efficacy trial data have highlighted the need to establish biomarkers that correlate with vaccine-induced protection against TB disease as, without such biomarkers, the only way to safely assess vaccine efficacy is by large trials with the diagnosis of TB disease as the endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Biomarkers and correlates of protection &#x02013; what should we look for, how and in whom?</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Current concepts</title><p>Immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection are biomarkers that reliably predict the level of protective efficacy induced by a vaccine. A biomarker is a unique indicator of a biological process and a biosignature is a combination of independent biomarkers which markedly increases the power of an individual marker.<xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65,66</sup></xref> Biomarkers for vaccines are typically identified by assessing differences in immune parameters between vaccinated individuals who are protected and unvaccinated, unprotected, control groups.<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> At present there are no validated correlates to reliably assess the efficacy of candidate TB vaccines. Moreover, host biomarkers are urgently needed to improve TB diagnostics and for the development of more effective and shorter treatment regimens. The perfect biomarker or biosignature for TB would differentiate between patients with active disease and latent infection, return to baseline levels following successful treatment, reproducibly predict clinical outcomes, predict vaccine efficacy and provide endpoints for clinical trials.<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> As such, robust biomarkers would have significant utility as surrogate endpoints rather than relying on clinical endpoints. However, based on our current understanding and knowledge of the biological and immunological responses that underlie discrete states of TB immunopathogenesis, it is unlikely that such a perfect biomarker exists.</p><p>The lack of a correlate of protection is a significant obstacle in TB vaccine development and persists due to our incomplete understanding of the natural infection and mechanisms contributing to host immunity to TB. To date, the most common parameters measured to assess TB vaccine immunogenicity are those considered important for protection against infection or disease. These have been determined through observational studies of mycobacterial susceptibility in humans and experimental animal models. The importance of IFN-&#x003b3; production by T cells is demonstrated by the significant increases in rates of <italic>M. tb</italic> in conditions of immune deficiency. These may be primary (e.g., the syndromes of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, MSMD) or acquired (e.g. HIV infection) and reduce the number and/or function of CD4+ T cells or impair IFN-&#x003b3; signaling.<xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68-70</sup></xref> As such, the primary immunological readout of TB vaccine studies is antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; production by T cells, typically using ELISpot assays.<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> In addition, other Th1 cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and frequencies of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells, determined by multi-parametric flow cytometry, are also thought to be important.<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67,71</sup></xref> However, there is clearly a disparity between those immunological responses stimulated by vaccination (correlates of immunogenicity) and those associated with protection from TB disease (correlates of protection).<xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> Several studies have shown that while significant increases in antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and changes in polyfunctional T cell profiles may be induced by vaccination, these responses do not correlate with protection against <italic>M. tb</italic>.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,40,73-75</sup></xref></p><p>Thus far, the immune responses considered essential for protection may well be necessary but they are not sufficient and as such these parameters do not have utility as correlates of risk or protection in TB vaccine efficacy trials.

The role of B cells also remains to be defined.<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67,71</sup></xref> It is likely that rather than a simple effector or memory output (such as that for the serogroup C meningococcal vaccine), multiple factors deployed in a coordinated and balanced immune response will be crucial for effective protection and therefore should be assessed in concert.<xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref></p><p>Characterizing naturally induced protection in <italic>M. tb</italic> infection among household contacts exposed to patients with pulmonary disease could be used to identify biomarkers that correlate with protective immunity.<xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> Such contacts exhibit diverse immune responses that would be suitable to study using systems vaccinology and would improve our understanding of the spectrum of <italic>M. tb</italic> immunopathology. For example, it is hypothesized that, despite significant exposure to <italic>M. tb</italic>, some individuals have no evidence of immune sensitization which is likely due to inherent resistance or the elimination of infection through an effective innate immune response or non-primed adaptive immunity. In contrast, latently infected, asymptomatic individuals, probably exist on a spectrum of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection and exhibit immunological evidence of T cell priming and persisting quiescent infection which is controlled by the acquired immune response.<xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77,78</sup></xref> Within this heterogeneous group the host-pathogen relationship is highly dynamic and some individuals may eventually effectively eliminate the infection, others will maintain persistent, life-long infection, while another group will develop subclinical disease and progress to primary active disease or reactivation TB.<xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77,79,80</sup></xref> Household contacts therefore define a range of immune phenotypes that could help in characterizing correlates of risk and protection with application to TB vaccine development.

While targeted approaches assessing specific biomarkers such as cytokine production or the characterization of immune cell phenotypes in antigen-stimulated samples (e.g., whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells) have advanced our knowledge, they are insufficient. Moreover, peripheral blood samples, though easily obtainable, may not represent the complete immunological milieu at the principal interface between host and mycobacteria - the pulmonary granuloma.

Increased IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signaling, pro-inflammatory signaling through the Janus kinase pathway, and differential expression of Fc-&#x003b3; receptors, innate immune-related genes and gene clusters involved in apoptosis and natural killer cell activity have all been described.<xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr"><sup>91-101</sup></xref> Changes in the transcriptome during treatment, indicative of modulation of humoral responses, have also been reported.<xref rid="cit0102" ref-type="bibr"><sup>102</sup></xref> Interestingly, a recent combined &#x02018;meta-like&#x02019; analysis of all transcriptomic data reported in human TB pathogenesis showed a myeloid-derived inflammatory signature to be of particular importance.<xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr"><sup>103</sup></xref> There are undoubtedly unresolved issues in this area, such as the need to define disease-specific profiles and difficulties in comparing data from studies using different cohorts, experimental techniques and approaches to data analysis.<xref rid="cit0104" ref-type="bibr"><sup>104</sup></xref> However, there are also several exciting developments including the increasing availability of affordable RNA sequencing and growing interest in the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in TB and their potential utility as biomarkers and even as targets for therapeutic intervention.<xref rid="cit0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>105-111</sup></xref></p><p>Proteomic profiling of serum samples from TB patients using high-resolution mass spectrometry or protein microarrays has identified several peptides and antibodies that may have diagnostic potential.<xref rid="cit0112" ref-type="bibr"><sup>112-116</sup></xref> Most recently, mass spectrometry has also been used to isolate a novel antigen from human TB granulomas.<xref rid="cit0117" ref-type="bibr"><sup>117</sup></xref></p><p>Finally, metabolic profiling is the identification of small molecular metabolites (e.g. amino acids, lipids, fatty acid, sugars and nucleotides) in clinical samples using high-throughput methods.

Integrating large datasets from different techniques is computationally complex and advances in bioinformatics are needed to obtain the greatest value from these high-throughput data.<xref rid="cit0123" ref-type="bibr"><sup>123</sup></xref> Recent progress in this area includes the rationalisation of large numbers of genes into smaller, distinct immune modules in which the constituents are highly related and typically expressed in a coordinated way.<xref rid="cit0124" ref-type="bibr"><sup>124</sup></xref> This approach is logical as biological processes occur in a modular manner and it affords simpler data analysis and more intuitive interpretation. It has been applied successfully to several diseases and infections (including <italic>M. tb</italic>) and recently to vaccination studies.<xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr"><sup>91,125&#x02013;127</sup></xref></p><p>Systems vaccinology is an exciting development and potentially an extremely powerful tool for understanding vaccine-induced immunity and predicting vaccine efficacy. However, it will need further refinement and close collaboration between vaccinologists, immunologists and bioinformaticians if it is to yield truly valuable outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0003"><title>Alternative approaches to clinical efficacy trials</title><p>An alternative, but complementary approach, to testing vaccine efficacy in clinical trials is to identify correlates of protection using human pathogen challenge models. Such models have shown great utility in malaria, influenza, dengue, cholera and typhoid vaccine development.<xref rid="cit0128" ref-type="bibr"><sup>128-135</sup></xref> They also have the potential advantage of gating promising vaccine candidates at an early stage, with significant implications on cost and time.</p><p>Clearly, it is not possible to challenge volunteers with strains of virulent <italic>M. tb</italic>, however there is increasing interest in using BCG derived from <italic>M. bovis</italic> as a surrogate for <italic>M. tb</italic> infection in a human mycobacterial challenge model. The basis of this model in the hypothesis that an effective TB vaccine, which reduces or prevents <italic>M. tb</italic> replication, should have a similar effect on BCG replication. The benefits of using BCG in this model include that it has significant genetic sequence homology to live <italic>M. bovis</italic> (and therefore <italic>M. tb</italic>), it is a functional, replicating organism that results in limited infection in the immunocompetent host and, crucially, it is safe and licensed for use in humans by intradermal administration.<xref rid="cit0136" ref-type="bibr"><sup>136</sup></xref> Optimisation of a BCG human challenge model could be used to establish the clinical parameters for subsequent challenge models using attenuated <italic>M. tb</italic> strains.</p><p>A murine model has shown that live BCG can persist in skin for at least 4 weeks and in draining lymph nodes for up to 12 weeks, and that intradermal BCG vaccination consistently protects against a BCG challenge, independent of vaccine dose, route of challenge (intradermal or intranasal) or the interval between vaccination and challenge.<xref rid="cit0137" ref-type="bibr"><sup>137</sup></xref> Similar findings have been seen using a novel BCG intranodal challenge model in cattle.<xref rid="cit0138" ref-type="bibr"><sup>138</sup></xref> Other murine studies have demonstrated the efficacy of BCG vaccination against <italic>M. tb</italic> aerosol challenge.<xref rid="cit0139" ref-type="bibr"><sup>139-141</sup></xref> Taken together, these data suggest that intradermal BCG challenge may reflect a pulmonary vaccine effect, supporting the relevance of a mycobacterial skin challenge in predicting vaccine efficacy against <italic>M. tb.</italic> This approach has most recently been used in a human model in which healthy BCG-na&#x000ef;ve and BCG-vaccinated volunteers were challenged with intradermal BCG and BCG load was quantified from skin biopsy specimens. In previously BCG-vaccinated individuals, quantitative PCR analysis of biopsies reflected a degree of mycobacterial immunity to challenge.<xref rid="cit0142" ref-type="bibr"><sup>142</sup></xref> These data were supported by subsequent transcriptomic analysis showing that immune signatures, particularly IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 pathways, were strongly induced in previously BCG-vaccinated volunteers and correlated with reduced mycobacterial growth following BCG challenge.<xref rid="cit0143" ref-type="bibr"><sup>143,144</sup></xref></p><p>However, in early studies culture data were not supportive of the PCR findings in detecting a difference between na&#x000ef;ve and vaccinated groups, which may be due to an overestimation of the protective effect of BCG by PCR, or less contemporaneous and reliably comparable results obtained by culture.<xref rid="cit0142" ref-type="bibr"><sup>142</sup></xref> In addition, a major limitation to date has been low mycobacterial recovery which has reduced the sensitivity of the model and its ability to discriminate between individuals with differing levels of vaccine-induced anti-mycobacterial immunity. Optimisation studies addressing this issue by evaluating the effect of BCG strain and dose on mycobacterial recovery are in progress. Furthermore, confirmation that BCG challenge reflects pulmonary vaccine effect may ultimately require parallel intradermal and pulmonary challenge trials and comparison of validated immune correlates of protection. Interestingly, a novel intranodal BCG challenge model in cattle has previously shown that BCG vaccine effect is similar to that seen following aerosol challenge with <italic>M. bovis</italic>.<xref rid="cit0138" ref-type="bibr"><sup>138</sup></xref> While it is recognized that further optimisation and development of human BCG challenge models is needed, together with consideration of the target population and type of vaccine candidate that the model has greatest relevance to, the concept represents a promising development that warrants further investigation.</p><p>There is increasing interest in matching the route of vaccination to the route of natural infection and the first phase I trial assessing a candidate vaccine administered to humans by aerosol has been completed.<xref rid="cit0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>145</sup></xref> The rationale for this approach is that local protective immune responses may be enhanced following delivery of a TB vaccine directly to the respiratory mucosa, thus optimising protection against pulmonary disease. Similarly, the development of a human aerosol BCG challenge model, in a carefully controlled setting, would be more representative of natural infection and could validate an intradermal BCG challenge model.</p><p>Finally, in the future there will undoubtedly still be a need to conduct clinical efficacy trials of vaccines that have been highly selected and show greatest potential. Undertaking trials in high TB incidence settings may be of particular value. A study among adolescents in South Africa showed that 50% of the cohort had evidence of LTBI, as demonstrated by a positive IFN-&#x003b3; release assay (IGRA).<xref rid="cit0146" ref-type="bibr"><sup>146,147</sup></xref> It has been estimated that with a 10% annual conversion rate and 0.05% error, a vaccine trial powered to show a 60% effect against infection would need 1000 participants and one year of follow-up.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> In contrast to regions with low rates of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection where IGRA serial testing shows frequent conversions and reversions, among adolescents in a high incidence setting there is less IGRA variability, conversion rates are similar to those seen with TST and predict the development of active TB disease in subsequent years.<xref rid="cit0148" ref-type="bibr"><sup>148-150</sup></xref> Therefore, IGRAs may have utility as a biomarker for <italic>M. tb</italic> infection in such settings and offer an endpoint for vaccine trials.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref></p><p>However, several of the issues previously discussed that may impact vaccine efficacy in human clinical trials will be prevalent in these settings, such as exposure to NTM and helminth infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>TB remains one of the greatest burdens on global health and the importance of an effective vaccine in controlling the epidemic is undisputed. Over the past 20 years, much progress in TB vaccine development has been made resulting in several candidates in clinical assessment. While the results of recent efficacy trials have been disappointing, they have highlighted the need to overcome important obstacles which will be essential if we are to succeed in developing a vaccine against <italic>M. tb</italic>, such as the need to define and validate biosignatures of immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection. This has forced the field to re-evaluate its approach to TB vaccine design and evaluation which has been a positive outcome, complemented by the emergence of exciting and potentially very powerful technologies such as those of systems vaccinology. Despite the many challenges ahead, with continued coordination and collaboration within the TB vaccine community, iterative progress will be made.</p></sec>
