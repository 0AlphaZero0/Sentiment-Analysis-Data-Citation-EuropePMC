<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by various strains of mycobacteria, with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) being the most common causative agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is a serious global health threat with one-third of the world&#x02019;s population estimated to be latently infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Though about 90&#x000a0;% of those infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> are asymptomatic, possessing only a 10&#x000a0;% lifetime chance of developing active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], even in developing countries with established healthcare systems, TB is still a deadly disease.</p><p>In 2006, the World Health Organization launched a &#x0201c;Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis&#x0201d; that aims to save 14 million lives from TB by 2015. This objective is being hampered by the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The only currently available vaccine is bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The vaccine is often administered to children, but the effectiveness of protection decreases after about 10 years.</p><p>With TB being one of the most common causes of death from infectious diseases, the current challenge is developing a sensitive and efficient method for the detection of latent TB infection (LTBI). The disease begins in the lungs via infection from the blood stream or aerosol droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. After TB bacteria enter the bloodstream, they can spread throughout the body and infect various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], such as the heart skeletal muscles, pancreas, or thyroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, in LTBI, the bacteria remain dormant for several years before producing active TB. Even after treatment, the affected individual may still be susceptible to reactivation due to immunosuppression, or multiple-drug resistance in TB bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Substantial gene expression studies have revealed differences in the transcriptome between healthy controls and active TB or LTBI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These findings not only uncovered important genetic signatures indicative of active TB and LTBI, but also identified transcriptionally regulated markers that are diverse in functions. In particular, these candidate genes are responsible for various key biological processes including inflammatory responses, immune defense, cell activation, homeostatic processes, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, these studies demonstrated the importance of cytokine and chemokine responses in the progression from latent infection to active disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the overall gene expression array results vary due to diverse genetic background of the study population and differences in the study design.</p><p>Early diagnosis of TB is crucial for preventing its spread, but the detection of LTBI is a major challenge as the carriers are often asymptomatic. Sputum smear acid-fast staining, though fast and inexpensive, is not the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test. While the tuberculin skin test represents a common diagnostic method, it has a tendency to produce false-positive results in individuals previously inoculated with BCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Culturing of TB bacteria usually takes time and diagnosis based on the test results is not always accurate. The interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) seem to have the potential of becoming the gold standard for TB test. The assays have been introduced into clinical practice to measure the amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) released by blood cells infected wtih <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Unfortunately, this method is more expensive and requires blood samples with normal levels of viable leukocytes, which is not always possible in immunocompromised individuals. Consequently, an alternative quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was developed to detect the immune response to TB infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Yet, as most gene expression study results suggest, genetic background may influence the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.</p><p>Recently, Lu et al. (2011) conducted a gene expression microarray study to investigate the possibility of using mRNAs as biomarkers to differentiate active TB from LTBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, in their study, the expression of IFN-&#x003b3;, the biomarker used in IGRA, was not significantly different between the active TB and LTBI group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Instead, the combination of three genes, <italic>CXCL10</italic> (chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 10), <italic>ATP10A</italic> (ATPase, class V, type 10A) and <italic>TLR6</italic> (toll-like receptor 6) appeared to be effective at distinguishing between active and latent TB infection. In contrast, <italic>IL-8</italic> (Interleukin 8), <italic>FOXP3</italic> (forkhead box P3), and <italic>IL-12&#x003b2;</italic> (interleukin 12 beta) were demonstrated to be the best discriminating biomarkers for TB and LTBI by Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Discrepancies between the two studies may be attributable to the differences in genetic background. At the same time, these findings suggest that not only are gene expression biomarkers more significant indicators of active TB, but they may also represent a more sensitive detection method for LTBI. Nevertheless, the same combination of genetic markers may not be applicable in another population.</p><p>For the present study, we attempted to compare the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells among individuals with active TB, LTBI, and healthy conditions. We identified a panel of mRNAs that differed among these groups and subsequent validations with independent samples established the potential use of these gene expression biomarkers for the discrimination of LTBI from active TB in the Taiwanese population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Differentially expressed genes among TB, LTBI, and healthy controls</title><p>To identify candidate genes whose expression levels may differentiate among TB, LTBI, and healthy controls, we followed the workflow as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Variations in the transcriptional profile of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection are complex and can be attributed to multiple factors, including age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and study designs. Therefore, identifying distinct genetic signatures of active TB, LTBI, and healthy individuals that is population-specific becomes a challenging task.</p><p>In the current study, we examined the transcriptomes of active TB, LTBI, and healthy individuals, and uncovered specific molecular markers and pathways associated with each group. We found that there were more genes showing differential expression between the TB group and healthy controls as compared with LTBI versus healthy controls. GO and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the transcriptional profiles of TB individuals differed from those of healthy controls in immune system processes such as leukocyte and lymphocyte activation, differentiation, chemokine receptor activity. In contrast, although immune pathway alterations were indeed observed in individuals with LTBI at the transcript level, metabolic processes in these individuals also differed from the healthy controls. On the other hand, between TB and LTBI patients, the most important genes seemed to be mediators of inflammation, immune system responses, and apoptosis.</p><p>Our results support findings from other studies in that infection with <italic>Mtb</italic> triggers a relay of inflammatory signals and immune responses from the host. Upon entry, <italic>Mtb</italic> are recognized by various host receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors that are expressed on immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This host-pathogen interaction initiates a cascade of inflammatory responses, whereby alveolar macrophages produce cytokines and chemokines to alert the host of the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In response to this signal, T- and B-lymphocytes aggregate around the infected macrophages to form granulomas, a microenvironment to prevent bacterial spread and an isolated region for the lymphocytes to invoke apoptosis of the infected macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The bacteria have also evolved tactics to avoid this fate. After being engulfed by macrophages, the bacteria multiply in the phagosome, causing macrophage necrosis and allowing for their escape from the host defenses to infect other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is evident in our results in which a lot of the differences between TB and healthy controls were associated with mediators of immune responses.</p><p>In particular, our protein interaction analysis suggests that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may mediate the host defense against <italic>Mtb</italic>. It is known that TLR4 is important in modulating the balance between apoptosis and necrosis in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our analysis showed that TLR4 may interact with LY96 (lymphocyte antigen 96) and S1PR1 (Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1) in TB patients. LY96 is responsible for establishing the binding between the lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial cell membrane and TLR4 on the host cell surface, thus activating a series of immune responses in infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The bacterial strain <italic>Mtb</italic> has quite a few tricks to blunt the bactericidal mechanisms of infected macrophages so as to promote their persistence in the host. In latent TB infection, the bacteria manipulate the host antigen presentation processes and enter a non-replicating state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As a result, the bacteria remain dormant inside the phagosomes, and the granuloma became their safe hideout. This is evident in our observation that TB and LTBI differed not only in the regulation of immune responses, but also in the modulation of phagosome, autophagy and apoptosis. In fact, several apoptosis-associated molecules, such as decoy receptor 3, prostaglandin 2, and lipoxin, have been shown to correlate significantly with the status of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Compared with healthy controls, genes involved in cell cycle control seemed to be differentially regulated in individuals with LTBI. Our interaction analysis showed that this difference may be attributable to the interactions between mediators of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, such as JUN (Jun proto-oncogene), JUNB (Jun B proto-oncogene) and FOSB (FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), as well as regulators of translation. MAPK signaling is one of the pathways responsible for modulating the host&#x02019;s innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In fact, MAPK activation is important for inducing the expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses, but inactivation of MAPK activity is also important to prevent host tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, our interaction analysis also indicated that translational regulation represent important differences between LTBI and healthy individuals. It is known that bacteria can influence host tranlation in order to immobilize host defenses and promote their own survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, our finding supports that MAPK signaling and tranlsational control may underlie the differences between LTBI and healthy conditions.</p><p>In addition, alterations in the expression of genes involved in metabolic processes seemed to be a major difference between the LTBI group and healthy controls. Metabolism-related manifestations are known to be associated with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages would become lipid-loaded (foamy) in the granuloma, and the fatty acids accumulated as triacylglycerol represent the vital source of energy for dormant <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Also, certain immune-endocrine-metabolic alterations are thought to exist in TB patients, though molecular studies have yet to reach a consensus as to which molecules are the major players in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>To date, most identified biomarkers for active TB and LTBI are related to inflammatory and immune responses triggered by the pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, TB may be comorbid with various communicable diseases including influenza, bacterial pneumonia, HIV, syphilis, leishmaniasis, as well as non-communicable disorders such as diabetes, alcohol-related diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, cancer, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In fact, our gene set enrichment analysis mapped four genes, <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, that were differential expressed between LTBI and healthy controls to leshimaniasis-related pathways.</p><p>To avoid finding biomarkers that overlap with other diseases, we chose to verify differentially expressed genes that have not been identified as TB or LTBI biomarkers in independently recruited samples. We also included an established active TB marker, <italic>PTPRC</italic>, as a test reference. As a result, <italic>ASUN</italic>, <italic>DHX29</italic>, and <italic>NEMF</italic> were successfully confirmed to be differentially expressed among active TB, LTBI, and healthy individuals. Subsequent ROC analysis revealed the potential of <italic>PTPRC</italic>, <italic>ASUN</italic>, and <italic>DHX29</italic> in discriminating among TB, LTBI, and healthy conditions. Further classification experiments also indicated that combinining the three canidate biomarkers may be more effective in achieving accurate identification of the different disease states.</p><p>To be a biomarker, the gene should to be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. However, since functional analysis was not performed in this study, we try to postulate how these candidate genes may be involved in TB pathology based on their known functions. Among the validated genes, PTPRC is an essential regulator of host immune response through the modulation of T- and B-cell receptor signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the guinea pigs, <italic>PTPRC</italic> expression appeared to increase after exposure to <italic>Mtb</italic> and decrease after the infection persisted for a longer period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This is in line with our observation that <italic>PTPRC</italic> transcript level was decreased in active TB compared to LTBI and healthy state. <italic>ASUN</italic> is critical for the regulation of mitotic cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As the number of T-cells can determine whether an individual is susceptible to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection or active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], we suspect that the high level of <italic>ASUN</italic> expression in LTBI relative to the active TB and healthy controls may be associated with T-lymphocyte differentiation or proliferation. <italic>NEFM</italic> is a nuclear export mediator that have been implicated as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Nuclear export is an important process for the regulation of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. A recent in vivo study performed in mice suggested that autophagy can suppress the progression towards active TB by inhibiting <italic>Mtb</italic> growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Finally DHX29 is a helicase protein that participates in translation initiation, and its down-regulation has an inhibitory effect on cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which may be related to the altered cellular processes in TB.</p><p>Note that our study is limited by the small sample size and lack of functional studies to determine the roles that the identified candidate biomarkers play in the pathogenesis of TB. This might have also been the reason that we did not observe more genes associated with the TLR signaling pathway, an established mechanism underlying <italic>Mtb</italic> recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. As a result, this pathway was not the most enriched in any of the comparisons. Equally likely is that the changes in <italic>TLR</italic> genes might be dependent on treatment duration. It has been demonstrated that the increase in <italic>TLR4</italic> expression level appeared to be more significant compared to <italic>TLR2</italic> after 1 month of treatment in TB patients when compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In our study, samples were collected at the time of diagnosis. More evident changes might be observed if we had examined the temporal expression profiles of TB and LTBI patients during treatment. Also, our experiments were focused on blood cells, instead of lung tissues. Therefore, the results are more relevant to biomarkers associated with TB and LTBI, and perhaps indirectly related to the pathology of the disease in the lungs. Moreover, BCG is known to have an effect on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In Taiwan, BCG vaccine should be administered to every newborn; therefore, all of our study participants have been inoculated with BCG. This may make our finding specific to not only the Taiwanese people, but also to those who have received this vaccine. Finally, despite the fact that evaluation of the biomarkers yielded relatively good results, due to the limited sample size and the variable prevalence of TB and LTBI in different seasons, we could not eliminate the possibility that other diseases or environmental factors may affect the effectiveness of the candidate biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have performed a genome-wide gene expression study comparing the transcriptional profiles among TB and LTBI patients, as well as healthy controls. Gene set enrichment analyses have identified specific biological processes and pathways associated with genes that are differentially expressed among these groups. We have uncovered novel discriminatory biomarkers for TB and LTBI. Moreover, we have demonstrated, as a proof of concept, that the expression levels of <italic>PTPRC</italic>, <italic>ASUN</italic>, and <italic>DHX29</italic> may be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Validation of the diagnostic support system in a larger sample size would help confirm the discriminative potential of these biomarkers and facilitate the development of a cost-effective and sensitive molecular diagnostic platform for TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Clinical sample collection</title><p>The analytical flow of our study is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Written informed consents were obtained from all participants. For those who had reduced ability to consent (including minors), the carers or guardians gave written informed consents on behalf of these participants. Eligibility for entry into the study was based on clinical signs and symptoms of Mtb infection. All participants were interviewed and examined by a physician. Each subject received the sputum smear test, T-SPOT TB test, and took a chest radiograph. TB subjects were those who showed clinical signs of TB, in addition to having been tested positive on all tests. LTBI subjects were recruited from close contacts (&#x0003e;8&#x000a0;h/day for a total of &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;h of close contact) with active TB patients, tested negative on the smear test, positive on the T-SPOT TB test, appeared normal on their chest radiographs, and exhibited no clinical evidence of active TB. Healthy controls were individuals who had not been in close contact with TB or LTBI patients, obtained negative results on all tests and showed no clinical signs of TB or LTBI. Individuals with allergic diseases, diabetes, cancer, immune-compromised conditions, and co-infections with any types of infectious diseases were excluded. In total, seven healthy individuals, seven patients with active TB, as well as seven subjects with LTBI, were included in the microarray experiment. Additional participants (15&#x000a0;TB, 17 LTBI, and 15 healthy individuals) were recruited as independent testing samples for validation of the expression profiling results.
