<sec sec-type="intro" id="h0.0"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral malaria (CM) is associated with high case fatality rates, and a third of survivors develop epilepsy or other neurological sequelae (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Identification of novel strategies to decrease the high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with CM (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) in African children are needed (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). CM is defined as the presence of coma with confirmed <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection, exclusive of other identifiable etiologies of coma (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Microvasculature sequestration of late-stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) occurs in all <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic> clinical syndromes; however, in patients with CM, microvascular iRBC sequestration occurs in the brain, as well as other vital organs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). iRBC sequestration is accompanied by endothelial cell activation, upregulation of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and other endothelial cell receptors, alterations in endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), and deposition of platelets and fibrin in the brain microvasculature during CM (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This vasculopathy is associated with elevated inflammation, blood-brain barrier breakdown, severe brain swelling, and death in some individuals (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The identification of host factors that contribute to cerebral iRBC sequestration and vasculopathy could lead to novel therapies for CM to improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>Cerebral sequestration of iRBCs during pediatric CM occurs in 75% of cases and can be identified clinically through a retinal exam (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The presence of microvasculature abnormalities in the ocular fundus (&#x0201c;malarial retinopathy&#x0201d;) is strongly associated with the cerebral iRBC sequestration identified at autopsy (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Children with malarial-retinopathy-positive CM (Ret+CM) have a higher mortality rate than children with CM without malarial retinopathy (Ret-CM) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Specific CM-associated parasite proteins expressed on the iRBCs are associated with brain sequestration (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These CM-associated parasites are likely arbitrarily transmitted throughout the general population, yet only a small percentage of infections in young children result in cerebral iRBC sequestration. Therefore, we hypothesized that in addition to infection with CM-associated parasites, specific host factors modify the risk for iRBC sequestration in CM. To identify host factors associated with cerebral iRBC sequestration, we compared host whole-blood transcription profiles from Malawian children with Ret+CM to profiles from children with Ret-CM. Our data newly suggest that activated neutrophils play a role in Ret+CM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We studied Malawian children with CM enrolled in the Blantyre Malaria Research Project (BMP) as part of an ongoing longitudinal study (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). We performed whole-blood transcriptional profiling on 98 of the 205 blood samples obtained from patients at enrollment in the study during the 2009 and 2011 malaria seasons. There were no significant differences between patient characteristics of the hybridized samples and the complete cohort (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material).</p><sec id="s1.1"><title>Peripheral blood parasitemia is associated with whole-blood transcriptional profiles.</title><p>To first discover patterns in the whole-blood transcriptomes, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of 98 samples. We identified three transcriptional clusters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Most demographic, clinical, and laboratory features, including age and white cell subsets, were similar between the transcriptional clusters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), a parasite protein that can provide an estimate of the total body parasite biomass, was not significantly different between clusters (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In contrast, cluster 2 was significantly associated with high peripheral parasitemia, which represents circulating early stage parasites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 by the Mann-Whitney U test). Ret+CM and Ret-CM phenotypes were found in each cluster, though cluster 3 was significantly enriched for Ret-CM samples (<italic>P</italic> = 0.020 by the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test). Because of the association of peripheral parasitemia with global transcription, we adjusted each transcript by peripheral parasitemia to compare the transcriptional profiles between Ret+CM versus Ret-CM in our primary analysis.</p><p>We then compared the whole-blood transcriptomes from 64 Ret+CM patients and 33 Ret-CM patients.

A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to cerebral iRBC sequestration and vasculopathy may lead to the development of adjunctive therapies to improve clinical outcomes. We compared whole-blood transcriptional profiles and plasma protein levels in children with Ret+CM and Ret-CM and identified higher levels of activated neutrophils and inflammation and upregulation of ECM and coagulation pathways in Ret+CM patients. In contrast, the Ret-CM patients demonstrated lower concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and higher IFN-&#x003b1;2 levels and upregulation of alternative stress response pathways and TLR pathways. We speculate that multiple dysregulated pathways and higher levels of activated neutrophils and inflammation mediate critical changes in endothelial cells and platelets and/or coagulation to favor cerebral sequestration.</p><p>We employed whole-blood transcriptional profiling to obtain a comprehensive analysis of host physiology during CM by retinopathy status. This approach has provided insights into various infectious and vascular disease mechanisms (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We first evaluated the transcriptional profiles by unsupervised clustering and identified three transcriptional clusters that did not fully segregate by retinopathy status. Cluster 2 was associated with high peripheral parasitemia, lactate levels, respiratory rates, and mortality. This constellation of clinical features has been identified in previous studies (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our association of a distinct transcriptional pattern with these clinical features may further suggest a pathophysiologic subtype of CM. The peripheral parasite load contribution to transcriptional variation was also observed in a mild malaria blood transcriptome study in Benin children, which suggests that the peripheral parasite load plays a dominant role on host responses irrespective of the severity of disease (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). HRP2 levels were not associated with the clusters. This suggests that the circulating parasites have an important effect on host blood transcriptional responses, perhaps due to rupture and release of parasite antigens.</p><p>Our Ret+CM cohort had features known to be associated with cerebral iRBC sequestration, including lower platelet counts and hematocrits and higher HRP2 levels and mortality compared to Ret-CM patients (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The Ret+CM and Ret-CM cohorts had similar peripheral blood parasitemias, suggesting that the development of vasculopathy is unrelated to control of peripheral parasitemia. This is consistent with other studies in regions where malaria is endemic where the severity of malaria is not associated with peripheral blood parasitemia (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>The samples from Ret+CM patients were associated with alterations in ECM, dysregulation of the coagulation pathway, and heightened inflammatory responses, which are consistent with prior studies of CM (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Furthermore, we now demonstrate that these changes are associated with Ret+CM compared to Ret-CM. We also identified upregulation of platelet transcripts and platelet degranulation pathways in Ret+CM. Platelets are found in the microvasculature at autopsy in pediatric CM patients, and iRBCs can adhere to platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecules PECAM-1/CD31, suggesting that platelets can facilitate cerebral iRBC sequestration (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). However, platelets have also been found to have antimalarial activity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The harmful or protective role of platelets in Ret+CM remains to be determined. Overall, prior autopsy studies demonstrating fibrin thrombi and changes in microvascular endothelial cells reflect the pathways we found associated with Ret+CM (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the characterization of multiple pathways associated with Ret+CM, our novel finding is that higher levels of activated neutrophils are associated with cerebral iRBC sequestration and vasculopathy in Ret+CM patients. We focused on neutrophil biology, as activated neutrophils can mediate changes in endothelial cell receptors, platelets, and the coagulation cascade, which may be relevant to CM iRBC sequestration and pathology. There is scant information on the role of neutrophils in severe malaria. Prior studies have found an association of elevated serum lipocalin and HNE concentrations in severe malaria compared to mild malaria (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Neutrophil elastase was 2.9-fold higher in plasma samples from Ret+CM patients, and it can mediate endothelial cell disruption and damage (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Neutrophils produce superoxide anions in response to <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic>, which can decrease vascular integrity and endothelial cell function, upregulate endothelial cell receptors to facilitate iRBC sequestration, and enhance platelet activation (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Inhibition of neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species by superoxide dismutase or inhibition of neutrophil elastase with ONO-5046 Na could be examined to determine whether this inhibits iRBC sequestration to endothelial cells (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>).</p><p>Plasma PRTN3, a neutrophil product, was fivefold higher in Ret+CM patients, and it cleaves surface EPCR (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). PRTN3 could account for the reduced detection of EPCR and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble EPCR (sEPCR) reported in CM patients and contribute to the procoagulant state in Ret+CM patients (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). It is unknown whether neutrophils are an essential component in the development of Ret+CM. Neutrophil depletion studies in the animal model of malaria have shown protection against experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), though the interpretation of these data may be limited due to the concomitant potential depletion of non-neutrophil cell types (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Studies on how activated neutrophils alter endothelial cells and may enhance iRBC sequestration are under way.</p><p>Our study, like others, found neutrophils in the brain microvasculature only rarely, and furthermore, we did not detect any NETS (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The paucity of neutrophils at the site of malaria infection could be due to their generalized chemotactic dysfunction to both IL-8 and fMLP. The chemotactic dysfunction may result from the elevation in heme, which was greater in Ret+CM patients; however, the factors that mediate neutrophil recruitment into the microvasculature are complex (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Neutrophil chemotactic dysfunction has been previously reported in malaria, and neutrophils exposed to iRBC microparticles have been shown to migrate more slowly (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Neutrophil dysfunction has also been reported in sepsis and has been linked to inducible nitric oxide synthase, which can inhibit neutrophil migration (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Postmortem analysis cannot completely exclude the possibility that neutrophils are present locally in the microvasculature <italic>in vivo</italic> due to their short cellular life spans, and interestingly, neutrophil recruitment in the microvasculature has been detected in the <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA ECM model during intravital microscopy (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). </p><p>Why neutrophil activation and dysfunction are more elevated in children with Ret+CM is unclear. Children with Ret+CM had higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, a known inducer of neutrophil activation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Differences in TNF-&#x003b1; promoter polymorphisms or other host mutations mediating inflammatory responses could be driving the higher neutrophil activation state in Ret+CM patients (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). We examined only a limited number of host polymorphisms that are associated with reductions in risk of severe malaria; none of our patients with CM had &#x003b1;-thalassemia or the sickle cell trait, which is prevalent in the general population in Malawi (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). All of the patients in our cohort had the Duffy null polymorphism, which is associated with benign ethnic neutropenia. Why this allele is enriched in individuals with African ancestry is unknown, and it is intriguing to consider whether <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic> played a role in its selection (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The examination of other host mutations that control neutrophil activation or other aspects of neutrophil biology, such as the single-nucleotide polymorphisms in neutrophil-derived &#x003b1;-defensin and neutrophil elastase, could be examined (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>).</p><p>The Ret-CM patients provide a valid comparison group, because they also have severe illness and were infected with <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic>. These children also manifested an encephalopathy with similar clinical and laboratory features, but they lacked cerebral iRBC sequestration, and this is reflected in the lower levels of HRP2 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Ret-CM patients had lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and displayed a very distinct set of host transcriptional responses. They exhibited higher induction of TLR pathways which has been shown in other studies of malaria (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). We also found that a subset of patients with Ret-CM had higher levels of fetal hemoglobin transcripts. iRBCs with fetal hemoglobin exhibit decreased adherence to endothelial cells <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and further studies are needed to determine whether iRBCs from Ret-CM patients have higher fetal hemoglobin protein and are less adherent to endothelial cells (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).</p><p>Ret-CM was associated with higher concentrations of plasma type I IFN. The type I IFN pathway appears to play an important role in the host response to malaria, as mutations in the type I IFN receptor gene are associated with protection to severe malaria, and type I interferons may modulate changes in the endothelium to protect against iRBC sequestration (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). In the ECM model, mice treated with type I interferons have enhanced survival, reduced ICAM-1 expression in brain endothelial cells, and reduction in serum TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). The pathways associated with Ret-CM may provide insights into host protective mechanisms against brain sequestration in CM. Specific parasite <italic>var</italic> genes are also associated with brain sequestration (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Thus, targeted host response studies combined with parasite <italic>var</italic> gene analysis could identify novel mechanisms of protection from cerebral iRBC sequestration.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we examined the patients after their illness was under way, which restricts our ability to identify the pathological processes that mediate cerebral iRBC sequestration. Differences in the number of episodes of malaria prior to their presentation with CM could underlie the variation in host responses in Ret+CM and Ret-CM patients, and this information is unknown in our cohort (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Longitudinal studies of immune responses and clinical presentation in infant cohorts could characterize the effect of the timing and number of infections on the development of protective host responses in CM-related vasculopathy.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified host response pathways and heightened neutrophil activation in Ret+CM patients compared to Ret-CM patients. A threshold of heightened neutrophil activation may trigger downstream events to alter endothelial cell receptors and coagulation to facilitate cerebral iRBC sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). In contrast, children without vasculopathy have very distinct host responses which may be protective from cerebral iRBC sequestration. Further studies on the role of activated neutrophils in vasculopathy and the potentially protective host responses in Ret-CM children are needed to identify rational targets for adjunctive therapy.</p><fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>A model of cerebral iRBC sequestration in pediatric Ret+CM patients. A model for the role of activated neutrophils in the endovascular pathology of Ret+CM is shown. Our model proposes that multiple systemic factors modulate endothelial cell biology to result in the widespread endothelial iRBC sequestration seen in Ret+CM patients. Our data suggest a novel role of activated neutrophils in this process, and under conditions of inflammation and coagulopathy, the vascular endothelium is modified to facilitate iRBC adherence. Soluble neutrophil factors include the following. (1) Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1;, MCP-1) (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93&#x02013;96</xref>) that stimulate the endothelium to increase cell adhesion molecule expression (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1). (2) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) that impair endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97&#x02013;99</xref>) to promote a pro-inflammatory response, increase cell adhesion molecule expression, disrupt the endothelial blood-brain barrier, and cause endothelial cell dysfunction. (3) Proteinase 3 (PRTN3) and neutrophil elastase (HNE) can modify the endothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>), and PRTN3 cleaves endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), an endothelial cytoprotective and anti-coagulation mediator (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>), promoting coagulation cascade activation, fibrin formation, and activated platelet deposition (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) on brain vascular endothelium. (4) This systemic pro-coagulant and adhesive endothelium state leads to increased recruitment of immune host cell (e.g., monocytes, white blood cells) recruitment and widespread iRBC sequestration in the microvasculature of the brain and other vital organs, where local and systemic stimulation of endothelial and white blood cells causes an exacerbated host response leading to and perpetuating the vasculopathy of Ret+CM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0011626830005"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Patient population.</title><p>This study was conducted in Malawian children between the ages of 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;years with <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic> infection and a Blantyre coma score of &#x0003c;3 enrolled in the Blantyre Malaria Research Project (BMP) as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of CM (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
