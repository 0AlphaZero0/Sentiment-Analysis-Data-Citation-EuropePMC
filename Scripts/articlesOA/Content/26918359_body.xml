When studying the immune response in humans, researchers may have access only to the blood, and not the tissues where the ongoing infection or autoimmune processes are occurring. We demonstrate herein that gene expression changes observed in the tissue upon infection with the intracellular bacteria <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> also occur in blood, demonstrating the utility of transcriptional analysis of blood. In addition, we show that different changes in the gene expression profile in blood and tissues in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> as compared to WT mice are observed at varying times post-infection. In addition we show that genes are not only differentially expressed upon infection but also in the uninfected state in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> as compared to WT mice, which likely contributes to the net global expression changes, which we observe after infection. This may be explained by either changes in gene transcription in discrete cell types or changes in cell composition, such T cells, myeloid cells and plasmacytoid DC.</p><p>We show firstly that the immune-inflammatory transcriptional response during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection in a murine model system, as seen in whole blood, relates well to that occurring at major sites of infection such as the spleen. Upon infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> increases and decreases in gene expression were observed which were enriched for TREM1, IL-10 and Granulocyte Adhesion and diapedesis some of which are in keeping with previously reported mechanisms of protection or pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, differential expression of a large number of type II IFN-inducible genes was observed, which are known to be important for protection in the immune response against this intracellular pathogen, in part through activation of phagocytosis and bacterial killing in macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additional changes in expression of genes known to be downstream of type I IFN signaling, which is known to prevent bacterial control [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were also shown to be enriched in both blood and spleen of infected mice. This is in keeping with previous reports on the cross-regulation between these two IFN signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Down-regulation of lymphocyte signaling pathways were observed in the spleen and the blood of infected mice, which could be accounted for by a reduced proportion of T cells that we observed by flow cytometric analysis of the blood and spleen of infected mice. Previous findings have shown that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection induces the apoptosis of lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which may reflect this observed reduction in the relative percentage of T-cells in the blood and spleen and downregulation of T-cell signaling pathways observed at the transcriptional level. Although we could not see a difference in expression levels of general apoptotic genes this could be since at this time point post infection the cells expressing the apoptotic genes had already apoptosed as our flow cytometry data supports. This demonstrates the usefulness of blood transcriptional profiling to capture the global response to pathogens to reveal potential mechanisms of protection or pathogenesis in both mouse and man.</p><p>We sought to investigate further how abrogation of type I IFN signaling would impact blood and tissue transcriptional signatures occurring during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection using <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, to shed additional light on how type I IFN may negatively regulate bacterial clearance. The majority of transcripts which were identified to be significantly differentially expressed in WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> strains of mice were changed as a result of the infection at days 2 and 3 post-infection. A smaller proportion of transcripts were significantly differentially expressed as a result of the combination of infection and WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse strains at days 2 and 3 post-infection, where there was a significant difference in bacterial loads. By comparing the fold change response of transcripts to infection in WT or <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse strains, it was seen that the response was broadly comparable in the WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> despite the absence of type I IFN signaling. This also included the majority of genes found within the IFN IPA signaling pathway. Of note, the perturbation of blood transcripts at day 1 was most pronounced in WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice as a result of infection (approximately 42%), at a time-point when there was no difference in bacterial loads. Of the 42% of transcripts that were perturbed at day 1 post infection in the blood of <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> as compared to the WT mice, detailed IPA analysis showed increased expression of genes associated with antigen presentation, including <italic>Tap1</italic>, <italic>Nlrc5</italic>, <italic>Lmp2</italic>, and increased expression of <italic>Ifng</italic>, would suggest enhanced antigen presentation in the absence of type I IFN signaling. In addition increased levels of <italic>Ip10</italic>, <italic>Irf1</italic>, <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Icsbp</italic>, at day 1 post infection in the blood of <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> as compared to the WT mice is in keeping with type I IFN inhibition of Th1 responses and could explain the subsequent reduction in bacterial load in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> infected mice. Our findings that increased <italic>Ifng</italic> expression was accompanied by increased levels of <italic>Il10</italic> could suggest that Th1 cells which have been shown to produce both cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] are reduced in the WT possibly by type I IFN inhibition of IL-12 production by myeloid cells as we have previously demonstrated during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Changes in gene expression were also seen in the blood of the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> as compared to WT mice in the absence of infection (approximately 25%), suggesting that type I IFN signaling is already evident in uninfected mice. The small number of transcripts shown to be perturbed in the blood and tissue of <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> as compared to WT mice in the absence of infection were shown a cohort of genes dependent on IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R signaling. A proportion of these type I IRGs match known type I IFN responsive genes as identified in the Interferome v2 database. Amongst these genes dependent on IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R signaling in the uninfected mice were IRGs including OAS family genes, IRF genes, and <italic>Stat1</italic>. We found that many of these same genes had similar FC induction following infection, however given the lower expression in the uninfected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> compared to the WT their final expression remained lower in the infected <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> compared to the WT. This finding highlights the need to consider both the relative expression levels as well as the degree of gene induction (fold change) when interpreting expression data. Basal levels of <italic>stat1</italic> gene expression are reduced in the blood and tissue of uninfected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice as compared to WT controls. This effect on <italic>Stat1</italic> in uninfected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice has previously been described at both the mRNA and protein level in a variety of tissues [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; and type I IFNs require STAT1 for signaling [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; utilises the STAT1 homodimer (GAF) whereas type I IFNs utilise the heterotrimer of STAT1-STAT2 and IRF9 (ISGF3) to initiate transcription at their respective promoter sites [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This lower <italic>Stat1</italic> expression may explain in our system the observation of diminished type II IFN inducible gene expression in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> compared to the WT following infection.</p><p>Previous evidence has suggested that low-level type I IFN signaling occurs in the steady state [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and this type I IFN priming may be important for optimal responses to cytokines and cytokine production from immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150251.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, the commensal gut microbiota has been shown to signal in part via the type I IFN receptor and this signaling is important for the priming of the immune system and its subsequent response to pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our findings suggest that this basal priming of type I IFN signaling may contribute to the overall response to a pathogen and its resolution. Expression of <italic>Irf7</italic>, which is known to be one of the most inducible <italic>Irf</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was induced in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> upon infection to an equivalent degree as compared to the WT. However, its basal level of expression in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice was so low to start with that its final expression in blood and tissue upon infection remained lower than that seen in the WT mice before infection. Thus, although clearly inducible in the absence of type I IFN signaling (it can be induced by other factors [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]), it is clear that despite this the magnitude of the response is limited by basal priming by Type I IFN. In contrast <italic>Irf3</italic> expression was not affected by either infection or the absence of Type I IFN signaling. Expression of <italic>Irf1</italic> was increased in response to infection but in contrast to <italic>Irf7</italic>, <italic>Irf9</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic>, there was no difference in baseline or final expression in response to infection in WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice.</p><p>The expression levels of both type I and type II IFN inducible genes following infection as shown by the Molecular Distance to Health (MDTH) was reduced in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> compared to the WT mice at day 3 post infection where the bacterial load was much diminished in the infected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Thus this decrease in type I and type II IFN inducible transcripts may result from either a dependence on type I IFN signaling or a lower bacterial load. However, at day 1 post infection where the bacterial load was not affected in the infected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> the converse was true with an increase in both type I and type II IFN-inducible genes suggesting a direct role of type I IFN signaling in suppression of this response. Previous studies have shown that type I IFN production during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection suppresses macrophage activation by IFN-&#x003b3;, by decreasing <italic>Ifngr1</italic> mRNA and surface expression of the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. At the whole tissue level we do not see significant <italic>Ifngr1</italic> expression above background levels in either WT or <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (data not shown), which may highlight the complexities of studying multiple cell types within tissues in transcriptomic approaches. We observed increased expression of <italic>Stat1</italic> in the blood of infected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice versus WT controls at day 1 post infection when bacterial loads were similar, suggesting a direct of role of type I IFN signaling. However at day 3 post infection diminished expression of <italic>Stat1</italic> was observed across all three tissues, following infection in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> compared to the WT mice, which may be explained by a dependence on type I IFN signaling or may result from the lower bacterial load in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>.</p><p>The increase in the proportion of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes following <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection that we observe in the blood and spleen of WT mice is abrogated in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice probably as a result of the loss of IFN-inducible genes known for increasing numbers of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes. We also observed a significant decrease in pDC in the blood of uninfected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice compared to uninfected WT mice. Following infection there was a greater relative percentage of pDC in both the blood and the spleen of the WT mice compared to the <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. This observation may be due to the requirement of type I IFNs for pDC activation, migration and survival as it has been previously shown [<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150251.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>This study highlights the utility of using whole blood transcriptional signatures to profile the host transcriptional response in a model of infection. We show that the blood, spleen and liver signatures share similarity in their transcriptional response following infection and that these derived signatures are enriched for both type I and type II interferon signaling but differ according to the stage of infection. The role of type I and type II interferons in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection is complex with type II interferon signaling affording protection while type I interferon signaling promotes bacterial survival. This study also shows that the absence of type I IFN signaling alters the expression of multiple genes at the whole tissue level in uninfected mice. This lower expression may impact upon genes involved in more than one signaling pathway, the result of which in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection can result in a complex perturbation. These findings highlight the need to consider both the relative expression levels as well as the degree of gene induction when interpreting expression data and the temporal changes in gene expression, particularly in genetically manipulated cell lines or animals where the basal expression in a number of genes may be altered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All research was performed in strict accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and compliance was monitored closely by the Francis Crick Institute&#x02019;s Ethical Review Committee and the UK Home Office.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Mice</title><p>Female C57BL/6 mice and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background) were bred and housed in the specific pathogen-free facilities at The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London, UK.
