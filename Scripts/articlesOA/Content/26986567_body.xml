<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>One and a half million deaths are attributed to nine million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB) per annum [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most individuals infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) do not develop disease, but co-infection with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 substantially increases this risk, even before progression to advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HIV-1 associated TB presents more frequently as primary infection and extrapulmonary or disseminated disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], suggesting inadequate immunological control of Mtb. In addition, rare genetic immunodeficiencies show unequivocally that interferon (IFN)&#x003b3; responses and signalling pathways associated with CD4 T helper (Th)1 immunity are necessary for protection against mycobacterial infection generally [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, most people with active TB typically exhibit robust Th1/IFN&#x003b3; responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that may even contribute to immunopathology [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, factors other than Th1 immunity must contribute to protection. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mtb infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, and point to a putative detrimental role for type 1 IFNs [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Investigation of HIV-1 associated TB has focussed on deficient CD4 T cell responses which are evident before severe depletion of circulating CD4 T cells in AIDS [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, HIV-1 infection also causes persistent type 1 IFN responses and chronic immune activation by diverse mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, increased TB disease in HIV-1 infected patients may arise as a result of inadequate inflammatory responses that are unable to control bacillary growth, or exaggerated inflammatory responses that lead to increased immunopathogenesis. The latter are widely implicated in the mechanism underlying TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) which can occur after initiating treatment for HIV-1 with antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We hypothesise that unbiased genome-wide assessments of anti-mycobacterial immune responses in HIV-1 patients with and without IRIS may identify deficient responses that contribute to host protection against TB, or exaggerated responses that drive its pathogenesis. These may also extend our general understanding of immunological correlates of protection and pathogenesis in TB, and thereby allow better stratification of the risk of disease after Mtb infection, rational design of novel vaccines and development of host-directed therapies to radically shorten duration of treatment or mitigate against increasing TB drug resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Systems level assessments of human immunobiology in active TB have principally described changes in peripheral blood transcriptional profiles. Quantitatively these changes correlate with disease severity and resolve with treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, differences between patient populations in cross-sectional studies are likely to be confounded by differences in the bacillary burden and duration of infection, neither of which can be measured accurately. Moreover, recent longitudinal functional imaging studies in experimental non-human primate models and in patients with active TB revealed that different foci of disease within the same host show autonomous and discordant activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], indicating localised immunopathology within the tissue microenvironment which may not be represented faithfully by measurements in the systemic circulation. In order to address these limitations, we undertook whole genome transcriptional profiling of biopsies from the tuberculin skin test (TST) in order to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of human immune responses to TB at the site of a standardised experimental challenge. Clinical inflammation in response to the TST has been widely used as a measure of anti-mycobacterial T cell memory [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but we have previously shown that transcriptional profiling of the TST in healthy people provides quantitative and qualitative measurements of multivariate molecular components of innate and adaptive cell mediated immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Importantly, we were also able to detect changes in transcript abundance in the absence of clinical inflammation, and thereby identify immune responses in TSTs that would otherwise be described as anergic by conventional assessments. This offers unprecedented opportunities to assess immune responses to TB in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection who frequently exhibit clinically negative TST responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In this study we demonstrate that transcriptional profiling of the TST in patients with active TB accurately models molecular pathology within foci of pulmonary TB. We use this approach to identify changes to in vivo human immune responses to TB at different stages of HIV-1 infection in patients with clinically positive or negative TSTs and in patients with unmasking TB IRIS, each group representing different immunological states associated with increased risk of active TB or increased immunopathology. By taking a genome-wide approach, we test the hypothesis that the dysregulation of anti-mycobacterial responses in each of these states extends beyond selective deficiency or exaggeration of Th1 responses to other immunological components that may also contribute to increased risk of TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Molecular profiling of the TST in HIV-1 negative patients with active TB</title><p>We first sought to describe the response to 48 hour TSTs in HIV seronegative patients with active TB as early as possible after diagnosis and within one month of starting anti-mycobacterial treatment. The TST caused clinically evident inflammation and histology revealed leukocytic infiltrates consistent with a cell mediated immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A TST transcriptional signature was identified, comprising 1725 genes with significantly increased transcript abundance compared to biopsies of control saline injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) enrichment analysis was used to infer upstream regulation of the TST gene signature. Binding sites for NF&#x003ba;B family members showed most statistically significant enrichment, but enrichment of IRF2, STAT1 and STAT3 binding sites were also evident, consistent with innate immune, IFN and other cytokine stimulated signalling associated with each of these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s015">S1 File</xref>).

Although peripheral blood transcriptional changes in active TB have been reported within the first week of treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], differences in the duration of treatment of individual patients in the present study were not associated with segregated clustering of TST transcriptional signatures in principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

Cell type specific modules were derived by comparison of transcriptomes from selected purified immune cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s005">S5A</xref> Figs), and independently validated in data sets from purified cell types and diverse tissue specimens in which module enrichment was consistent with histological assessments of cellular composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s005">S5B&#x02013;S5G Fig</xref>). Cytokine or innate immune stimulus-specific modules were derived from differential transcriptional responses of monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) to selected cytokines associated with alternatively polarised T cell function and to selected innate immune stimuli associated with Mtb or alternative pathogens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Analysis of cellular modules showed selective accumulation of circulating leukocytes within the TST. T and NK cell, monocyte and neutrophil derived modules were most enriched, but there was significantly less enrichment of the B cell module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Cytokine specific gene modules showed greatest enrichment of IFN&#x003b3; inducible transcripts, which we infer to predominantly reflect Th1 activity. Some enrichment of TNF&#x003b1; activity, which is also thought to contribute to protection to immune protection in TB [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and IL4/IL13 activity associated with Th2 polarised responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were also evident to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Innate immune specific modules showed enrichment of genes exclusively upregulated by Mtb and TLR2 stimulation, but not genes exclusively upregulated by TLR4 or <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (Spn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Although TLR2 is a well-established innate immune receptor for both Mtb and Spn, TLR2 independent responses to Spn are also recognised [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, we interpret the absence of any modular enrichment for TLR4 and Spn exclusive responses as evidence for specific anti-mycobacterial innate immune responses within the TST rather than non-specific inflammation. In order to confirm that differences in duration of treatment or site of disease did not confound the TST transcriptome at systems level, we also showed that neither of these variables affected the expression of cell type or stimulus specific modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p><p>In order to test the validity of the TST as a model for TB immunopathology, we next assessed the expression of the TST signature within published genome-wide transcriptomes of human lung TB granulomas and healthy human lung [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The geometric mean expression for the TST gene signature was greater within TB granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and correlated precisely with the magnitude of genome-wide transcriptomic differences between granulomatous TB and healthy lung tissue, which was represented by molecular distance to health (MDH) for each of the granulomatous lesions. In contrast, a signature of the same number of randomly selected genes showed no correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Moreover, the correlation between MDH and the geometric mean of the TST signature was statistically stronger than that of any other cell or stimulus specific gene expression module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), suggesting that the TST signature better reflects variability at the site of disease than any of its component parts. Changes in peripheral blood transcriptomes of patients with active TB have also been associated with severity of clinical disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For comparison with the TST signature, we derived a peripheral blood transcriptional signature of genes with significantly increased expression levels in our patients with active TB compared to healthy volunteers, which also showed statistically significant correlation with MDH in pulmonary TB granulomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The blood derived signature showed some overlap with the TST signature at molecular and systems levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Importantly, however, the TST transcriptional signature included immune response genes that were not increased in the blood of patients with active TB. Notably, these included components of chemokine networks that can be expressed by endothelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] within tissue biopsy specimens and may contribute to immune cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Moreover, granulomatous inflammation in response to TB, which is dependent on immune cell recruitment, occurs exclusively in tissues rather than blood. Accordingly, within pulmonary TB granulomas, the TST signature was significantly more enriched and showed a statistically stronger correlation with MDH than the blood derived signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Taken together, these analyses show that the transcriptional changes within the TST reflect molecular changes at the site of active TB with much higher fidelity than changes in peripheral blood, and can be used to quantify cellular recruitment and specific innate and adaptive immune responses.</p><fig id="ppat.1005469.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005469.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Expression of the TST signature genes in granuloma at the site of disease in pulmonary TB.</title><p>Relative mean expression of the TST gene signature from HIV-1 negative patients with active TB, or equivalent number of random genes, in transcriptional data from human lung TB granuloma (n = 5) is compared to (a) data from healthy lung (n = 2), and to (b) genome-wide MDH in TB granulomas.

Therefore, we evaluated TST responses in three separate clinical phenotypes comprising patients with active TB and HIV-1 co-infection who either exhibited a clinically positive TST response, or those who exhibited a clinically negative TST response, or patients with possible unmasking TB-IRIS (<xref rid="ppat.1005469.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s013">S1 Table</xref>). The TST transcriptome of each group was compared to that of HIV seronegative patients with active TB, as a standard reference. We focussed on patients with active TB to overcome the difficulty in controlling for TB exposure in asymptomatic HIV-1 positive individuals for whom HIV-1 infection confounds peripheral blood interferon gamma release assays normally used to identify prior exposure [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, this approach allows assessment of immune dysfunction associated with IRIS. In view of the greatly increased risk of active TB in HIV-1 infection, and the increase in immunopathogenesis in IRIS, we hypothesised that features in the TST transcriptomes that were decreased in each of the groups of HIV-1 infected patients may represent immune correlates of protection, and that features that were increased may represent immune correlates of pathogenesis.</p><table-wrap id="ppat.1005469.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005469.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of demographic, clinical and laboratory data of study groups.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="ppat.1005469.t001g" xlink:href="ppat.1005469.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Participant characteristics</th><th align="justify" colspan="6" rowspan="1">Patients with active TB</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV&#x000a0;-ve healthy volunteers</th></tr><tr><th align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th align="justify" colspan="4" rowspan="1">TST</th><th align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Saline controls</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV&#x000a0;-ve</th><th align="justify" colspan="3" rowspan="1">HIV&#x000a0;+ve</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV&#x000a0;-ve</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV&#x000a0;+ve</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TST&#x000a0;-ve</th></tr><tr><th align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TST&#x000a0;-ve</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TST +ve</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB-IRIS</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Number</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Age (median &#x00026;

In contrast, recent data from non-human primate models suggest IL10 contributes to the optimal balance of host-protective immune responses within TB granulomas [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, we reported in vitro data showing that HIV-1 infection of macrophages attenuates IL10 responses to co-infection with Mtb, leading to exaggerated inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, increased risk of active TB in HIV-1 infected patients with preserved Th1 immunity, may principally arise from deficient IL10 immunoregulation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that this group of HIV-1 infected patients exhibit attenuated IL10 responses to the TST, in comparison to HIV seronegative patients, by using three independently derived modules for IL10 inducible genes. One previously published module was derived from IL10 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and two new modules we derived experimentally by stimulation of MDM with IL10 or by neutralising IL10 in zymosan stimulated MDM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s018">S4 File</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s009">S9A&#x02013;S9D Fig</xref>). In HIV seronegative patients with active TB, all three IL10 modules were enriched in the TST compared to control saline injection, confirming induction of IL10 activity in the host response to TST. Consistent with the hypothesis we derived from over representation of STAT3 TFBS amongst transcripts attenuated in HIV-1 infected patients, expression of each of the three IL10 modules was significantly less in HIV-1 infected patients with clinically positive TSTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

Nonetheless, changes in TST transcript abundance in 98 genes were evident in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

This finding was confirmed by modular analysis, in which only the specific module for IL4 and IL13 stimulated genes in MDM, to model Th2 activity, was significantly enriched in the TST transcriptome of TB-IRIS patients compared to both HIV seronegative patients with active TB, and to HIV-1 infected patients with clinically positive TSTs presenting with active TB that was not temporally associated with recent initiation of ARVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s010">S10C Fig</xref>). Further genome-wide comparisons of the TST transcriptomes of unmasking IRIS patients with those of non-IRIS TST positive HIV-1 infected patients also showed that unmasking IRIS was associated with an expanded TST transcriptome, with a subset of genes that show significantly higher transcript abundance enriched for Th2 associated pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). Once again, these transcriptional differences in the TST were not evident in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). We also sought to validate our observations in the TST transcriptome at the protein level by assessing IRF4, which is strongly implicated in induction of Th2 responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Increased transcriptional expression of IRF4 in the TSTs of unmasking TB-IRIS cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) was mirrored by increased protein expression demonstrated by immunostaining of IRF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005469.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat.1005469.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005469.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Exaggerated Th2 responses in HIV-1 infected patients with unmasking TB-IRIS.</title><p>In patients with active TB, the TST signature in HIV-1 negative patients with clinically positive TSTs (n = 16) and HIV-1 infected patients with unmasking IRIS (n = 3), relative to the mean of saline controls (n = 8), are compared by (a) Venn diagram, and (b) scatter plot of median gene expression showing correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) and covariance (slope), highlighting the genes that show statistically significantly increased expression in red.

Using this approach, we quantified Mtb specific innate responses, cellular recruitment and cytokine activity within the TST. We demonstrated that the same changes are evident in the transcriptome of human pulmonary TB granulomas, and were quantitatively correlated to the degree of immunopathology as measured by the MDH. Hence, the transcriptional profile of the TST provides an accurate model of the immune responses observed in TB lung granulomas, with better resolution than peripheral blood profiling. In order to undertake this analysis, we used the only five published transcriptional data sets from caseous pulmonary TB granuloma. More transcriptomic data comparing pathological lesions from the site of TB disease to normal tissue, and comparing TB granuloma at different stages of maturation, are necessary to consolidate our findings. In addition, we assessed the TST at 48 hours in line with clinical practice [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but measurements at earlier and later time points may help build a dynamic molecular model of its initiation, amplification and resolution, each of which may contribute to differences in outcome.</p><p>In order to understand the impact of HIV-1 infection on immune responses to Mtb, we reasoned that TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients with preserved clinical TST responses, those with clinically anergic TST responses and patients presenting with unmasking TB-IRIS, will each reflect distinct mechanisms of immune dysfunction that increase risk of active TB. HIV-1 infected patients with preserved clinical TST responses and relatively well preserved circulating CD4 counts experience 3-5 fold greater risk of active TB [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Their TST transcriptional signature showed less enrichment of the T cell module, but IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; activity, which are thought to mediate protective immunity to TB [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] were intact. Instead, we found evidence of deficient IL10 responses, which mirrored our previous report of deficient IL10 responses to Mtb by HIV-1 infected macrophages in vitro [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Given the immunoregulatory role of IL10 and recent focus on the importance of balanced immune responses in TB [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we propose that HIV-1 infected patients with preserved Th1 immunity may incur higher risk of active TB as a result of deficient IL10 immunoregulation. Whether attenuation of TST IL10 responses in this group of HIV-1 infected patients is due to decreased IL10 production by virus infected cells or indirect effects of virus infection on the immune system, requires further investigation. Nonetheless our data suggest that stratification of patients by this phenotype or trials of immunoregulatory therapies merit investigation in this group of HIV-1 infected individuals.</p><p>TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients with clinically anergic TSTs had significantly depleted circulating CD4 counts and their TST transcriptome revealed almost complete immunological anergy with markedly reduced cellular recruitment, cytokine activity and innate immune responses. Importantly, this is in striking contrast to healthy HIV seronegative people with clinically negative TSTs, in whom the full repertoire of prototypic cell mediated immune responses are evident at the molecular level [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The degree of immunological anergy in HIV-1 infected patients with clinically negative TSTs is likely to underpin the 20-30 fold increased risk of TB and atypical mycobacterial infection associated with advanced HIV-1 disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is interesting to speculate that immunodeficiency of this severity may also contribute to the relative failure of isoniazid preventative therapy in HIV-1 infected patients with clinically negative TSTs [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We infer that immune responses may therefore contribute to effective antimicrobial therapy, encouraging development of adjuvant host-directed therapies to improve TB treatment regimens. Remarkably, a type 1 IFN response to the TST was preserved in HIV-1 infected patients with clinically negative TSTs. This evidence extends human data for type 1 IFN responses to Mtb, and indicates that type 1 IFN responses may be uncoupled from the other innate immune responses that were severely attenuated in these patients. This finding is further supported by recent in vitro evidence for differential activation of IFN and inflammasome pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In view of the data that suggest type 1 IFN responses may compromise host immunity to mycobacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], these findings highlight the opportunity for specific therapeutic targeting of type 1 IFN activation pathways. Moreover, we hypothesise that increased proportions of type 1 to type 2 IFNs in this group of HIV-1 infected patients may further exacerbate their risk of active TB and contribute to the mechanisms of HIV immunodeficiency. Therefore, interest in targeting type 1 IFN activity to counteract chronic immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], may also help to protect against TB. A mechanism by which increased ratios of type 1:2 IFN activity may compromise host protective immunity in TB is thought to be mediated by upregulation of immunosuppressive IL10 responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Of note, we did not find a positive correlation between type 1:2 IFN activity and IL10 activity in the TST. In addition, we found no direct type 1 IFN induction of IL10 expression in MDM, which has been previously reported in human monocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, we conclude that this potential mechanism is unlikely to play a role in advanced HIV-1 infection.</p><p>HIV-1 infected patients presenting with TB two to eight weeks after starting ART, showed exaggerated transcriptional responses to the TST in keeping with the consensus case definitions for IRIS [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Both bioinformatic and independently derived gene module analysis provided entirely new insight into the immunopathogenesis of TB-IRIS, implicating a role for exaggerated Th2 polarised responses rather than increases in Th1 or innate immune responses. This Th2 bias was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. This phenotype was statistically significant despite our very limited sample of three patients, but clearly merits further evaluation in future studies as it suggests that in the context of TB-IRIS at least, strategies targeting Th2 responses specifically should be considered for therapeutic intervention and may underpin the beneficial effects of glucocorticoid therapy in TB-IRIS [<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005469.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, the effects of HIV-1 described above were specific to the site of immunological challenge and not evident in the steady state peripheral blood transcriptome of the same patients. Transcriptional profiling of the TST revealed differences in immune responses that were previously unrecognised by clinical assessments alone or previous laboratory investigations. Hence, we have identified novel and diverse molecular mechanisms by which human immune responses to Mtb are dysregulated in HIV-1 co-infected patients. Further validation of our observations in independent prospective cohorts is necessary. These data will inform rational development of host-directed adjuvant therapies to target specific immunological dysfunction in different patient groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Study approval</title><p>This study was approved by UK National Research Ethics Service (reference no: 11/LO/1045) and the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (reference no: 580/2012).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study population</title><p>HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative adult patients (&#x0003e;16 years age) attending TB clinics in London and TB inpatient facilities and clinics in Cape Town who fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005469.s013">S1 Table</xref>) within one month of starting treatment for active tuberculosis (TB) were invited to participate.

Histological scoring of inflammation was performed on a 0&#x02013;3 scale, where 0 represented no evidence of inflammation and 3 was the most inflammation within the spectrum of samples.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1005469.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Clinical and histological scoring of TSTs.</title><p>Comparison of (A) clinical TST responses and histological scores, and (B) CD4 counts in the different study groups indicated and relationship between CD4 counts and TST induration (data points represent individual subjects and median of each group, *p&#x0003c;0.05 Mann-Whitney test).
