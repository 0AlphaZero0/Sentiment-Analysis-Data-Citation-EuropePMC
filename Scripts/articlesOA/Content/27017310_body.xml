This compartment, although conveniently sampled, may not accurately reflect pathogenic events in the lung, primarily affected by tuberculosis disease. Regardless, circulating white blood cells can serve as sentinels of lung pathophysiology, as transcriptional changes occur when the cells migrate through this organ.

Four genes assayed exhibited nominal expression differences (unadjusted p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05) and, when combined, two genes, IL-13 and AIRE, fit the data (ROC AUC fit = 0&#x000b7;8). The association between these genes and tuberculosis progression was not validated in a test set or independent cohort; none of the four genes exhibited differences between progressors and controls in our whole blood RNA-Seq datasets.</p><p id="P89">Our results, demonstrating that blood-based signatures in healthy individuals can predict progression to active tuberculosis disease, pave the way for the establishment of diagnostic tools that are scalable and inexpensive. An important first step would be to test whether the signature can predict tuberculosis disease in the general population, rather than the select populations included in this project; for example, the risk of TB disease in our populations was much higher than the lifetime risk of 10% encountered in the general population. The newly described signature holds potential for highly targeted preventive therapy, and therefore for interrupting the global epidemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS773529-supplement-1.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1178" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>01</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS773529-supplement-01.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1182" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec>
