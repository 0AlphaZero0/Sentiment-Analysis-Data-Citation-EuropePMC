<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) caused the death of 1.5 million people in 2013 despite potential for an 86 % treatment success rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. New drug regimens are needed to maintain and improve therapy for tuberculosis, shortening treatment duration and targeting drug-resistant bacilli which complicate 3.5 % of new and 20.5 % of previously-treated TB cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The standard chemotherapy regimen for drug-sensitive TB uses combinations of 4 drugs over 6 months. The recommended treatment for multidrug-resistant TB lasts 18&#x02013;24 months or more, with increasingly toxic combinations of second-line drugs. Extended periods of chemotherapy are required to remove sub-populations of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.tb</italic>) bacilli that persist through the early phase of antimicrobial drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent treatment shortening trial failed to show non-inferiority despite evidence that the experimental regimens were more bactericidal in the first 4 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Evidence for the existence of persister populations recalcitrant to treatment is accumulating; quantitation of mycobacteria in serial sputum samples during treatment with regimens containing isoniazid display a characteristic biphasic pattern of killing, indicative of the presence of multiple populations of <italic>M.tb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The exposure of sputum-derived bacilli to resuscitation-promoting factors unmasks a previously-unculturable drug-tolerant population of <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and sub-populations of bacilli that only grow in liquid culture and not on solid media may represent 90 % of bacilli in sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar <italic>M.tb</italic> populations have also been identified in chronic murine tuberculosis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and generated in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Microfluidic systems have revealed heterogeneous mycobacterial responses to antibiotic exposure in genetically-homogenous populations, providing a basis for the generation of such sub-populations in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is unlikely that the duration of tuberculosis chemotherapy will be reduced until drug regimens are identified that can kill these persister sub-populations.</p><p>Success in tuberculosis chemotherapy is measured by the proportion of patients who fail therapy or who relapse after treatment is completed; therapy is monitored by counting <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputum and assaying markers of drug toxicity. Clinical or microbiological parameters, such as number of lung cavities or extent of lung cavitation, <italic>M.tb</italic> culture positivity at 2 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or bacterial load in sputum before the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], are associated with early treatment success but are poor predictors of treatment outcome. For example, use of a combination of biomarkers, culture negativity at 2 months and low extent of cavitation by X-ray, failed to be predictive of individuals where treatment could be shortened from 6 to 4 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, molecular profiling assays, such as those used to identify tuberculosis disease from patient blood transcriptional signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], have not been applied to bacteria during patient drug therapy to assess the predictive power of dynamic bacterial responses to antimicrobial drug exposure.</p><p>The transcriptional signature of <italic>M.tb</italic> reflects the bacterial physiological state and offers insight into the mechanisms required to survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An increased understanding of which <italic>M.tb</italic> bacterial phenotypes survive chemotherapy during natural infection will aid the design of novel intervention strategies. To this end, <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli have been profiled from in vitro models that mimic hypothesized features of <italic>M.tb</italic> persister populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Investigation of the mRNA signature of <italic>M.tb</italic> derived from human sputa revealed a slow/non-growing gene expression pattern alongside an accumulation of lipid bodies, a &#x02018;fat and lazy&#x02019; phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, by mapping the differential expression of <italic>M.tb</italic> respiratory pathways, the microenvironment surrounding bacilli was predicted to be, at least in part, hypoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This observation was confirmed by 3-dimensional PET-CT imaging of human lungs that highlighted the hypoxic and dynamic nature of lesions within an individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Transcriptional profiling the response of bacilli to drug exposure in vitro has helped to define antimicrobial drug class of action and mechanisms that may influence drug efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These drug-inducible signatures, used as a bioprobe, may also identify drug-tolerant <italic>M.tb</italic> populations by classifying divergent responses to drug exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>This study profiles sputum <italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional responses during the first 14 days of standard anti-tuberculous therapy, testing the hypothesis that persister-type bacilli are the dominant population in human sputum. Drug-induced changes in <italic>M.tb</italic> gene expression were observed 3 days after the start of chemotherapy that were not evident at 7 or 14 days. Furthermore, the profile of bacilli derived from sputum one or two weeks after drug therapy resembled pre-treatment sputum bacilli. This suggests that bacilli with a phenotype able to survive drug therapy were already present prior to the commencement of treatment. Bacteria with a drug-responsive phenotype during days 0 to 3 were no-longer present by day 7 and were presumably killed. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the diverse pathology of human disease influences the phenotype of <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli in sputum. We show that microbiological (bacterial load) and clinical (number of cavities) measures of disease were predicted from the changing <italic>M.tb</italic> sputum signature over time, as were parameters with prognostic value (positive TTP or MBL TB test, and bacterial load at 2 months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient sample collection, clinical and molecular parameters</title><p>Subjects with active pulmonary tuberculosis (HIV negative, sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB) were recruited in primary healthcare tuberculosis clinics in the Western Cape Province, South Africa following local ethical approval (Stellenbosch University Health Research Ethics Committee, Study no 99/039).

To investigate whether the gene expression trajectories over the first two weeks of therapy followed classifiable patterns, the patients (k) were divided into two classes based on the variance of the PC data points along the principal component axis: <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212; 1, <italic>if var</italic>(<italic>PC</italic>1)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>var</italic>(<italic>PC</italic>2) <italic>and y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, <italic>otherwise</italic>.

Stability selection yielded a set of stable, most predictive features of a particular clinical variable, which was used to train a regression or classification model. To optimize the number of features and to determine the predictive performance of the models, nested leave-one-out cross-validation was carried out, in which the inner loop determined the optimal number of variables and the outer loop the error of the model (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S1).

A total of 1083 genes were significantly differentially expressed in sputum-derived bacilli (day 0) compared to log phase growth, which revealed adaptations to respiratory and metabolic pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>/<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2 and Figure S3). The sputum transcriptional signature was dominated by the repression of genes involved in intermediate metabolism (II.A) and ribosome synthesis (II.A.1). These functional categories (defined by Cole et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) were significantly over-represented amongst down-regulated genes (hypergeometric probabilities of 9.4x10<sup>-15</sup> and 3.1x10<sup>-30</sup>, respectively). This drop in markers of cellular activity was accompanied with the repression of central metabolism and lipid biosynthesis, including the citric acid cycle (<italic>gltA2</italic>, <italic>kgd</italic>, <italic>mdh</italic>, <italic>korA/B</italic>, <italic>sucC</italic>, <italic>rv0247c/48c</italic>, f<italic>umC</italic> and <italic>mqo</italic>), FAS-1 (<italic>fas</italic>), FAS-II (<italic>fabD</italic>, <italic>acpM</italic>, <italic>kasA</italic>/<italic>B</italic>, <italic>fabG1</italic> and <italic>inhA</italic>), and mycolic acid synthesis and modification (<italic>mmaA2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>/<italic>4</italic>, <italic>cmaA2</italic>, <italic>pcaA</italic>, <italic>fadD32</italic> and <italic>pks13</italic>) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Conversely, genes involved in the glyoxylate shunt pathway and methylcitrate cycle (<italic>icl</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic> and <italic>rv1129c</italic>), catabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the predicted triacylglycerol synthases (<italic>rv1425</italic>, <italic>rv1760</italic>, <italic>rv3087</italic> and <italic>rv3371</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] were induced in sputum-derived bacilli. Thus, the <italic>M.tb</italic> sputum transcriptome suggests that central carbon metabolism and general metabolic activity is reduced in bacilli expectorated from the lungs of tuberculosis patients, with an increased emphasis on lipolytic pathways. The transcriptomic evidence also predicted that the respiratory state of bacilli was altered in sputum with the down-regulation of NADH dehydrogenase I (<italic>nuoD</italic>/<italic>E</italic>/<italic>F</italic>/<italic>G</italic>/<italic>K</italic>), cytochrome C reductase (<italic>qcrA</italic>/<italic>B</italic>/<italic>C</italic>) and aa3 cytochrome C reductase (<italic>ctaC</italic>/<italic>D</italic>/<italic>E</italic>) pathways that are utilized in aerobic and microaerophilic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Correspondingly, genes involved in nitrate reduction (<italic>narK2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>) were induced, indicating the potential for a switch to alternative electron acceptors and anaerobic respiration. These adaptations are likely to be mediated in part by the transcriptional regulator DosR (DevR) that is induced by hypoxia and nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], with several DosR-regulated genes significantly up-regulated in sputa (<italic>nrdZ</italic>, <italic>narK2</italic>, <italic>rv1738</italic>, <italic>pfkB</italic>, <italic>hspX</italic>, <italic>hrp1</italic>, <italic>rv3126c</italic> and <italic>rv3128c</italic>). Energy metabolism was also affected as ATP synthase genes (<italic>atpA</italic>-<italic>G</italic>) were repressed in sputum-derived bacilli; unsurprisingly the functional categories for aerobic respiration (1.B.6.a) and ATP-proton motive force (1.B.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were significantly enriched in those genes down-regulated in sputum (hg p-values 6.5x10<sup>-5</sup> and 3.2x10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively).

A direct comparison of day 7 or day 14 transcriptional profiles to day 0 revealed that <italic>M.tb</italic> gene expression was predominately repressed with time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>/<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>); 37 genes were significantly down-regulated at day 7 compared to day 0, and 37 genes were repressed at day 14 (29 overlapping with day 7 signature), with five genes induced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>/<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Of the genes that were down-regulated over time, 88 % were also repressed in sputum relative to log phase bacilli, suggesting that the non/slow-growing phenotype of sputum-derived bacilli was further enhanced over time and through chemotherapy. These genes encode ribosomal proteins (<italic>rpmH</italic> and <italic>rpsJ</italic>), ribonucleotide reductase subunits (<italic>nrdH</italic> and <italic>nrdI</italic>) involved in the generation of precursors for DNA synthesis, and type VII secretion system elements (<italic>esxA</italic>, <italic>esxB</italic>, <italic>esxH</italic>, <italic>esxN</italic>, <italic>esxO</italic>, <italic>esxV</italic>, <italic>espD</italic> and <italic>espG</italic>3). In contrast, <italic>prpC</italic>, a methylcitrate synthase up-regulated in day 0 bacilli relative to log phase bacilli was down-regulated with drug therapy, indicating that specific modifications to metabolic pathways may occur over time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Evidence of anti-mycobacterial drug action 3 days into treatment</title><p>An inflection point at day 3 of chemotherapy was identified by mapping significantly represented temporal gene expression profiles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Of the eight significantly represented gene curves describing the <italic>M.tb</italic> response to early drug therapy, six were modified at day 3 in comparison to day 0, 7 or 14 time intervals. The inference from this observation, that the mRNA signature 3 days after the start of chemotherapy was distinct from the other sputa time points, was reinforced by hierarchical clustering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4) and significance testing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>/<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). A total of 83 genes were significantly up-regulated 3 days after the start of drug treatment compared to pre-chemotherapy bacilli. The majority of these genes were also induced at day 3 relative to both 7 and 14 days of drug therapy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5) suggesting that the day 3 transcriptional pattern represented a short-lived response to the start of drug treatment. This mRNA signature consisted of a diverse subset of genes involved in intermediary metabolism (<italic>argF</italic>, <italic>bkdC</italic>, <italic>galU</italic>, <italic>hisA</italic>, <italic>hisF</italic>, <italic>icl1</italic>, <italic>moaD1</italic>, <italic>pfkB</italic>, <italic>phoT</italic> and <italic>pstC1</italic>), cell wall metabolism (<italic>alr</italic>, <italic>fbpD</italic> and <italic>murC</italic>) and response to oxidative stress (<italic>alkB</italic>, <italic>cyp136</italic> and <italic>rv0547c</italic>). The alternative sigma factor <italic>sigG</italic>, induced as part of the RecA-independent DNA damage response and implicated in the regulation of detoxification systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], was also up-regulated. Perhaps importantly, three genes involved in the export of antimicrobial drugs were induced at day 3: 1) <italic>rv1218c</italic>, encoding a putative ATP-dependent efflux pump regulated by RaaS (rv1219c) that is functionally significant in the response to antimicrobial drugs in non-permissive growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]; 2) <italic>rv2688c</italic>, a predicted ABC fluoroquinolone efflux pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; and 3) r<italic>v3066</italic>, a mycobacterial transcriptional regulator of the multidrug efflux pump Mmr (Rv3065) that has been shown to influence mycobacterial resistance to multiple toxic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Ten gene clusters (responsive to drug exposure) were identified to overlap with sputum transcriptional signatures exclusively after drug treatment had started. Transcriptional patterns reflecting exposure of bacilli to pyrazinamide and rifampicin were observed providing molecular evidence of in vivo drug action. Of the ten enriched drug responsive gene clusters, six were only significant at day 3. Quantitative RT-PCR of genes that are highly up-regulated after <italic>M.tb</italic> exposure to cell-wall inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], exemplified by <italic>iniB</italic> and <italic>efpA</italic>, were specifically induced at day 3 compared to drug-free day 0 bacilli (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The expression of these benchmark genes for the activity of isoniazid and ethambutol decreased at 7 and 14 days relative to day 3. Thus, the transcriptional signature of bacilli 3 days into chemotherapy may reflect in vivo drug-induced changes; however, many of these responses to drug action were short-lived and were not evident 7 or 14 days after the start of drug therapy. We hypothesize that these signatures represent the killing of a drug-sensitive <italic>M.tb</italic> population after 3 days chemotherapy, and reveal the presence of a pre-existing drug-tolerant <italic>M.tb</italic> population that persists through early drug treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional signatures reflect patient disease and predict treatment progress</title><p>All patients in this cohort were treated successfully for tuberculosis: nine of 15 patients were culture negative at 2 months, and all patients were culture negative at 3 months. Microbiological time-to-positivity scores (TTP) and molecular bacterial load (MBL) estimates were recorded alongside clinical parameters measuring severity of disease (chest radiograph score and the number of observable cavities) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) plotting the first and second principle components of the <italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional signatures from each patient over the first 2 weeks of treatment time showed that <italic>M.tb</italic> responses followed distinct trajectories (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This suggested that <italic>M.tb</italic> responses to drug therapy may differ between patients and that these bacterial mRNA signatures may reflect patient disease severity or predict treatment progress. Interestingly, two directions of travel emerged at 0&#x02013;3 days with South-North and East-West trajectories most common (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S6). Therefore, the PC trajectories were grouped into two classes according to the direction of movement in principal component space (South-North or East-West). Unsurprisingly, since the PCA patterns are a representation of the transcriptional responses, support vector machine classification (SVM) confirmed that PC trajectory class could be predicted from the gene signatures (classification error of 8 %, linear kernel). Furthermore, SVM was performed to test whether clinical or microbiological parameters collected for each patient would affect <italic>M.tb</italic> profiles such that the patient&#x02019;s membership in the South-North or East-West class could be forecasted. The number of observed cavities in the lung (at diagnosis) and the bacterial load at 8 weeks (MBL measurement) predicted PC trajectory class with a classification error of 13 %, a success rate of 87 %. These observations demonstrated that the expression profile of <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputum was associated with specific measurable patient parameters, that variability in clinical and microbiological manifestations of disease could be detected in the bacterial sputa signatures, which may also be of prognostic value.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The associations between patient clinical and microbiological parameters and <italic>M.tb</italic> sputa transcriptional signatures. <bold>a</bold>

The fitted compared to true data are plotted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>/<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, alongside the predictor gene set.

Notably, <italic>M.tb</italic> sputa signatures also predicted measures of early treatment response. The rate of decline in bacterial load from day 0 to day 3 (measured by MBL) was forecast with a Gaussian SVM model with a classification error of 3 %. TB test positivity at week 8 (positive wk 8 TTP or MBL assay) was correctly classified using a Gaussian SVM with a classification error of 11 % (successfully calling treatment progress 89 % of the time). Similarly, a high or low molecular bacterial load at week 8 could be determined from the sputa transcriptional dataset using SVM with a classification error of 0 %, 100 % test accuracy.

In this study we were able to use genome-wide transcriptional profiling to map the mRNA signatures of <italic>M.tb</italic> from the sputa of clinically well-defined patients through the first 2 weeks of treatment, offering insight into the phenotypic state of bacilli that persist through chemotherapy. This contributes to our understanding of the in vivo efficacy of combination drug regimens and may aid novel anti-mycobacterial drug development programs targeting drug-persistent bacilli. The pre-chemotherapy <italic>M.tb</italic> signature defined here extends and validates the findings of a previous microarray study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], confirming the <italic>M.tb</italic> sputa profile in a larger cohort of clinically-defined patients collected independently in a different country and assayed using a complementary profiling methodology. In addition, single gene inferences were verified by qRT-PCR using a panel of benchmark indicator genes.</p><p>The <italic>M.tb</italic> mRNA signatures 7 and 14 days after the start of drug therapy were most similar to that of bacilli before drug therapy had begun, as evidenced by hierarchical clustering and differential gene expression analysis. Transcriptional changes at 7 and 14 days also indicated that the <italic>M.tb</italic> day 0 sputum phenotype was enhanced with chemotherapy, with transcriptional markers of an active metabolic state further repressed over time. This mirrors findings from a recent study of <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputa using multiplex qRT-PCR that showed transition to a slow-growing low-metabolic activity phenotype after the start of drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The broad changes in <italic>M.tb</italic> sputum physiology reflected in these transcriptional patterns were conserved between studies, where day 14 signatures were more similar to day 7 than day 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] or day 3 (this study). However, we argue here that by using a well-defined log phase <italic>M.tb</italic> population as a comparator (as applied in many studies) enabled the pre-chemotherapy (day 0) <italic>M.tb</italic> population to be characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], allowing us to propose that a pre-existing, slow/non-replicating and likely drug-tolerant <italic>M.tb</italic> population dominates sputum before, and after, early drug treatment. This conclusion is supported by evidence from other studies identifying large non-culturable on solid media or rpf-dependent <italic>M.tb</italic> sub-populations in sputum prior to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>An inflection point in the mRNA profile 3 days after the start of drug treatment, of stress-responsive genes including mediators of drug efflux, likely represents the effects of anti-TB drug action, using bacterial mRNA responses as a bioprobe for cidal drug action during natural disease. This transcriptional signature was only observed 3 days into therapy and was absent after 7 or 14 days, where the mRNA patterns were more similar to sputa bacilli before treatment. We hypothesize that the mRNA signature at day 3 marks the killing of a drug-sensitive sub-population of bacilli, since these responses are not detected after drug exposure in phenotypically drug-tolerant bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. By mapping previously-characterized in vitro <italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional responses to antimicrobial drugs, we were able to define the in vivo action of standard regimen chemotherapy in a clinical setting. The expression of isoniazid-inducible benchmark genes (<italic>iniB</italic>, <italic>efpA</italic>) at day 3 alone suggest that the sputum bacterial population profiled here 1 week after the start of chemotherapy no longer respond to the antimicrobial actions of isoniazid. This finding supports the Walter et al. study that detected an isoniazid response in sputa bacilli 2 days after the start of drug therapy that disappeared 7 days into treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and mirrors evidence describing the bimodal early bactericidal activity of isoniazid in combination regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>This study should be seen as capturing changes in <italic>M.tb</italic> mRNA abundance rather than differential transcriptional regulation since the structure of the underlying <italic>M.tb</italic> population is unknown. Therefore, the transcriptional read-out described here represents the average changes in gene expression from shifting mycobacterial sub-populations found in sputum. As such, lack of a response to drug therapy might reflect limited exposure of bacilli to antimicrobial drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and/or the presence of drug-tolerant bacterial populations that are able to survive drug treatment. The development of mycobacterial phenotypic drug tolerance has been described in many in vitro models for tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and is often associated with a slow/non-replicating bacterial state, such as that inferred from the sputum <italic>M.tb</italic> mRNA signature. Moreover, recent observations using single cell reporter technology described the development of non-growing but metabolically-active mycobacterial sub-populations during murine infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our study further emphasizes the significance of drug-tolerant bacilli in human tuberculosis, identifying a transcriptionally-active <italic>M.tb</italic> population that persists through 2 weeks of standard chemotherapy.</p><p>Modelling <italic>M.tb</italic> gene expression in the sputa of patients over time revealed that the transcriptional pattern of bacilli varied from patient to patient with drug treatment. Correlation of patient indices of disease severity with bacterial mRNA signatures showed that basic microbiological (time-to-positivity, bacterial load at day 0) and clinical (chest radiograph score) parameters were reflected in the divergent <italic>M.tb</italic> responses. These associations suggest that factors such as bacterial load and disease pathology influence the host-pathogen interplay and, thus, the phenotypic state of bacilli, which in turn might affect the natural history of patient disease. Importantly, this demonstrates for the first time that the diverse pathology of tuberculosis affects measurable changes on the phenotype of <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli in sputa. Notably, transcriptional signatures were also identified that predicted measures of early treatment success (rate of decline in bacterial load over 3 days, MBL or TTP positivity at 2 months, bacterial load at 2 months). Although this study was not significantly powered to test these signatures, these observations highlight the potential use of assaying dynamic bacterial phenotypes through drug therapy as biomarkers for treatment efficacy. These data are supported by recent evidence suggesting that higher percentages of lipid-body-positive acid-fast bacilli 3&#x02013;4 weeks after the start of treatment, rather than initial baseline counts, correlated with treatment failure or relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].
