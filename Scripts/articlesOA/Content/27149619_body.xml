<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that has a substantial impact on global health.</p><p>Notably, outbreaks of influenza infection are usually associated with an increased incidence or severity of secondary bacterial infections responsible for high levels of morbidity during seasonal influenza episodes. We and others have previously shown that IFN-Is play a critical role in the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since their discovery in 1957, IFN-Is have been recognized as the central antiviral cytokines in vertebrates [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The type I IFN family mainly consists of numerous subtypes of IFN&#x003b1; and a single IFN&#x003b2;, whose induction appears to be ubiquitous in most cell types. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated IFN-I induction plays a key role in facilitating antiviral responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IFN-Is bind to a common heterodimeric receptor, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor (IFNAR), composed of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Binding activates the JAK/STAT pathway, which induces pro-inflammatory genes that inhibit viral replication and boost adaptive immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and regulates the transcription of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A recent study has shown that influenza infection can alter the composition of the intestinal flora, resulting in immunological dysregulation that may promote inflammatory gut disorders [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The mammalian gut harbors a complex microbiota that plays a key role in host health through its contribution to nutritional, immunological, and physiological functions. Intestinal commensals are required for maintaining gut homeostasis through dynamic interactions with the host&#x02019;s immune system [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Resident microbiota promote gut immune homeostasis by regulating T regulatory cells (Tregs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and T helper 17 cells (Th17) [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The gut microbiota can inhibit infection through direct microbial antagonism or by stimulating several host effectors and injury responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the intestinal commensals also pose an enormous challenge to the host that needs to remain &#x0201c;ignorant&#x0201d; to a selection of microbial antigens and keep the bacterial load anatomically contained, while remaining responsive to its dissemination [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Reciprocal interactions between gut microbiota and the host immune system shape the microbial community and influence imbalances that can lead to disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These changes are often characterized by a reduction of obligate anaerobic bacteria, and a proliferation of facultative anaerobic <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, some people with pulmonary influenza infections also experience symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders, especially children [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Influenza RNA is rarely recovered from their stool [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], so it is unclear whether the symptoms develop from swallowed respiratory secretions or from active infection of the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>In order to investigate the role of IFN-Is induced during influenza infection in modulating the endogenous intestinal microbiota, we established a model of influenza pulmonary infection using genetically modified animals with defective IFNAR signaling (<italic>Ifnar1</italic>
<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>mice). Remarkably, we found that influenza infection alters the intestinal microbial community supporting gut Proteobacteria pathobionts through a mechanism dependent on IFN-Is.</p><p>While the importance of IFN-Is in antiviral defense is well established, their role during bacterial infection is more ambiguous. Moreover, we wanted to test whether primary influenza infection can predispose the host to secondary intestinal bacterial infections. We therefore developed a model of sequential influenza pulmonary infection followed by secondary <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced colitis using <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>mice to investigate the effects of IFN-Is induced during influenza infection on intestinal host defense against <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Interestingly, we found that lung induced IFN-Is enhanced the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the inflamed gut and increased its systemic dissemination to secondary sites. Furthermore, we found that influenza pulmonary infection resulted in a profound inhibitory effect on the intestinal antibacterial and inflammatory responses against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection in a IFN-I dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Influenza-induced IFN-Is alter the intestinal microbiota</title><p>Previously, it was shown that influenza infection causes intestinal injury through microbiota-dependent inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Considering that IFN-Is are essential components of the host antiviral response, we hypothesized that these molecules might also mediate changes in the intestinal microbiota during viral influenza infection. To study this, we infected wild-type (WT) and <italic>Ifnar1</italic> knockout (<italic>Ifnar1</italic>

MiSeq Illumina analysis of microbial DNA extracted from fecal samples confirmed observations reported by others [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that the mouse intestinal microbiota, independent of the genotype, consists of two major bacterial phyla, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005572.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), with the most relevant classes being Bacteroidia and Clostridia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005572.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). No statistical differences were found in the fecal microbiota composition between WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, either before infection at day 0 or after mock infection at day 9. Moreover, we observed low abundance of Proteobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of the uninfected and mock-infected mice, previously reported by others [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], independent of the mouse genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005572.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Furthermore, at day 9 post PR8 infection, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were still the most dominant colonizers in both mouse genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005572.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Our findings, however, uncovered a significant blooming of Proteobacteria at day 9 after PR8 infection only in the WT mice, whereas no significant increase was noted in the <italic>Ifnar1</italic>

Although IFN-Is have been shown to protect against and limit infection with certain bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], they can also impair the clearance of others [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This suggests a complex and bacterium-specific mechanism of action.</p><p>Influenza virus is a major cause of respiratory illness in humans, with the potential to cause lung damage and sensitize the host to secondary pulmonary infections [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although gastroenteritis symptoms have been reported during infection, the mechanism through which influenza virus would affect the gut is not completely clear. Our studies have shown that influenza pulmonary infection has an effect on the mouse fecal microbiota and promotes secondary infection with the intestinal pathogen, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Importantly, we have shown that these effects are dependent on IFN-Is, which are induced in the lungs during influenza pulmonary infection. These in turn can alter the gut microbial composition and suppress host immunity to a secondary <italic>Salmonella</italic> intestinal infection.</p><p>In line with a previous study [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we found that PR8 infection and poly I:C treatment increased the relative abundance of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and decreased the number of <italic>SFB</italic> in the fecal content of WT mice. However, we found that the relative abundance of these bacterial groups remained unchanged after PR8 infection or poly I:C treatment in mice deficient in IFN-I signaling, demonstrating that IFN-Is play an essential role in regulating their numbers. Based on these results and consistent with previous observations [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we speculate that IFN-Is might regulate the populations of the major bacterial phyla within the intestinal tract. Moreover, our analysis showed that only particular members of the fecal microbiota were affected by PR8-induced IFN-Is. While anaerobes, such as Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, make up the majority of the healthy microbiota, IFN-Is released during influenza infection promote the blooming of indigenous Proteobacteria pathobionts to the detriment of restricted anaerobic commensals, leading to significant intestinal disbyosis. This is in accordance with previous findings that show that bacterial imbalance characterized by an enrichment of Proteobacteria is observed during intestinal inflammatory disorders in humans, including Crohn's disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and enteropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>In addition, we show that influenza- and poly I:C-induced IFN-Is promote the intestinal overgrowth of the bacterial pathogen <italic>S</italic>.

Typhimurium has been shown to induce the expression of IFN-Is by macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], along with improved host survival and enhanced control of <italic>S</italic>.

<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice in a necroptosis-dependent mechanism [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. While there were differences between <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-only infected WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, these differences were strongly exacerbated when mice were previously infected with PR8, indicating the contribution of IFN-Is produced during influenza infection to secondary <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection.</p><p>Considering that the number of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium that disseminated systemically was greatly increased following influenza infection in WT, but not in <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, this suggests that IFN-Is may potentially relax the intestinal barrier to allow for <italic>Salmonella</italic> systemic dissemination. In support of this, we found that the host inflammatory and antimicrobial responses against <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium were reduced in the intestine after influenza infection in a mechanism dependent on IFNAR. Host inflammatory responses are essential to keep <italic>Salmonella</italic> localized to the gut and to limit the systemic spread of the pathogen. The immunosuppression mediated by IFN-Is would diminish local host surveillance, resulting in poor control of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the gut and enhanced bacterial dissemination. We demonstrated that the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; was decreased at the transcriptional level in the inflamed cecum and at the protein level systemically in an IFN-I-dependent manner. This is important given the key role IFN-&#x003b3; plays in intestinal antibacterial immunity, host survival and resolution of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>The host inflammatory response against <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the gut [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] includes the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, some of which may possess a secondary function as regulatory molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Two critical components of the mammalian nutritional immune response against <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium are lipocalin-2 and calprotectin, which are both highly induced by this pathogen in the inflamed gut. Lipocalin-2 and calprotectin sequester essential nutrients from microorganisms and exert an antimicrobial effect against several bacteria, including intestinal commensals. Both antimicrobials were dramatically suppressed in the inflamed gut after PR8 infection in a mechanism that depended on IFNAR signaling. Paradoxically, we know that the metal deficiency induced by high levels of both antimicrobials can be evaded by <italic>Salmonella</italic> through expression of high-affinity metal transporters [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, metal starvation may still have a critical defensive role against <italic>Salmonella</italic> by forcing infected host cells in the local microenvironment to undergo apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], thereby destroying the internalized <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Furthermore, both antimicrobial peptides act as crucial paracrine chemoattractants to recruit neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which play a major role in preventing systemic dissemination of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, as suggested by clinical and experimental data [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Additionally, the induction in the gut of anti-inflammatory <italic>Il10</italic> after influenza infection might, not only inhibit the bactericidal response of macrophages, but also cause infected macrophages to function as hosts for bacterial replication, as previously shown [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. IL-10 has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and regulation of subsequent host immune responses. IL-10 levels are elevated in susceptible strains of mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] suggesting that those strains producing IL-10 at high levels cannot adequately control <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Moreover, the relevance of the anti-inflammatory role mediated by IFN-Is in the gut during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection was confirmed by histopathology, which underscores the concept of the double-edged sword IFN-Is represent during secondary intestinal infections. Although IFN-I-mediated effects promote <italic>Salmonella</italic> intestinal colonization and systemic dissemination, they also limit the damage triggered by exacerbated inflammation induced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Furthermore, several clinical trials could not completely define the therapeutic effects of IFN-Is in patients with ulcerative colitis, an IBD with a complex etiology that includes genetic and environmental factors leading to chronic inflammatory responses against the gut microbiota [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This raises important questions about the potential mechanisms of action of IFN-Is in IBDs such as ulcerative colitis. Notably, IFN&#x003b2; therapy markedly attenuates the course and severity of disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies previously showed that IFN&#x003b2; induced the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 from lymphocytes acquired from patients with MS [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], which might indicate that IFN&#x003b2; could eventually induce an anti-inflammatory response in the colonic mucosa as well.</p><p>Many investigators have reported a variety of both beneficial and detrimental immune functions for IFN-Is during bacterial infections, and this clearly expands the old misguided notion that IFN-Is serve &#x0201c;only&#x0201d; as antiviral cytokines. Specifically, we have examined the effects of IFN-Is induced by pulmonary influenza infection in intestinal bacterial homeostasis and during secondary enteric infection. We propose that during influenza infection, this family of cytokines alters the intestinal microbiota composition, leading to an overgrowth of pathobionts which puts the host at risk to develop intestinal bacterial disorders. This is particularly significant as IFN-Is are currently being used as anti-inflammatory therapies for several immunological disorders such as IBD and MS.</p><p>Furthermore, we propose that influenza-induced IFN-Is enhance susceptibility to <italic>Salmonella</italic> intestinal colonization and dissemination during secondary <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced colitis through suppression of host intestinal immunity.</p><p>Our work highlights the critical importance of further studies that clarify the roles and effects IFN-Is play in balancing host susceptibility to bacterial infection and inflammatory control, as well as the potential risk associated with influenza infection in predisponing the host to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections and intestinal disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Bacterial strain and culture conditions</title><p>IR715 is a fully virulent, nalidixic acid-resistant derivative of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Typhimurium WT isolate ATCC 14028 [<xref rid="ppat.1005572.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].
