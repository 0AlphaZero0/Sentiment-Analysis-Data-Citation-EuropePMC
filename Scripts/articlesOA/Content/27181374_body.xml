They were also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes by Elie Metchnikoff in 1893<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. After a 14&#x02010;day maturation in the bone marrow, neutrophils can be provisionally stored in a pond before being released into the blood<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, where they circulate as dormant cells<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. When activated, neutrophils are the first cells to be recruited to the locations of inflammation, and provide the first line of defense. They have traditionally been considered as short&#x02010;lived effector cells (just 8&#x02013;12 h in the circulation and 1&#x02013;2 days in tissues), possessing limited capacity for biosynthetic activity and releasing granules and reactive oxygen species (ROS)<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. However, this classical view was challenged by the development of more sensitive approaches and research tools. It has recently been shown that neutrophils have a longer circulatory life span (up to 5 days) than first suggested (Figure <xref rid="jdi12469-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. As an important element of the inflammatory response, neutrophils direct and guide the innate immune response by engaging in complex interactions with macrophages, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and through cross&#x02010;talk with most of the cellular effector mediators<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Stimulated by type I interferons (IFNs), neutrophils can contribute to the host response towards intracellular pathogens by involving gene expression<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. After activation, neutrophils can promote an innate immune response through releasing soluble pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), which have the capacity to augment phagocytosis, stimulate complement and modulate inflammation. They can also secrete a diversity of cytokines, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and microorganism&#x02010; and tissue&#x02010;damaging molecules to participate in innate resistance<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Through a combination of these cytotoxic substances, neutrophils not only eliminate inflammation, but also damage cells and tissues of the host. Additionally, neutrophils are implicated in the activation, recruitment, programming, and modulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells, and can help mediate the initiation of specific T and B cell immunity through soluble mediators or by direct cell&#x02013;cell contact<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Accordingly, an aberrant neutrophil response can exacerbate and even initiate a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies&#x02010;mediated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="jdi12469-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Neutrophil&#x02010;derived multiple effector molecules. During the process of maturation or on stimuli activation, neutrophils can express and/or release numerous cytotoxic substances. Three categories of granules, including azurophil granules, specific granules and gelatinase granules, are discharged during the degranulation process and are recognized as the basis content of their enzyme. Apart from these classical granules, neutrophils contain highly mobilizable secretory vesicles that serve as a reservoir primarily for plasma membrane receptors. Simultaneously with their degranulation, the initiation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity (a part of the cellular respiratory burst) in neutrophils occurs, and then various reactive oxygen species (<styled-content style="fixed-case">ROS</styled-content>) are generated. Furthermore, neutrophils can produce numerous cytokines, which are considered to be the most critical effectors because of their vast and diverse of biological activities.

Furthermore, neutrophils were observed to infiltrate the pancreas in type 1 diabetes patients; (iii) neutrophil toxic tools, such as neutrophil elastase, were proved to increase in type 1 diabetes patients and associate with the pathogenesis of &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell autoimmunity as well as diabetic complications; and (iv) related antineutrophil treatments were shown to dampen and reduce the development of insulitis and autoimmune diabetes.

It has been concluded that increased levels of circulating neutrophils could be caused by immoderate enlistment from the bone marrow and/or the return of marginated cells to the circulatory pond<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. However, more recent studies showed that circulating neutrophil numbers decreased in patients with type 1 diabetes and healthy autoantibody&#x02010;positive subjects, which might be associated with &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell specific autoimmunity<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Reduced numbers of blood neutrophils in type 1 diabetes could be a result of abnormal neutrophil yield and maturation, peripheral consumption or damage, and tissue detainment.

The discrepancy in alterations of neutrophil counts from different studies might result from the discoveries from different stages of diabetes or different ethnic groups. Further investigations are required to explain the variance in the changes of neutrophil counts, and a more comprehensive and longitudinal study might clarify the difference. Neutrophil functions were also reported to change at different steps in type 1 diabetes.

ICAM&#x02010;1 expression on vascular endothelial cells was reported to increase in the pancreatic islets of the NOD mouse<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0107" ref-type="ref">107</xref>, as well as in individuals with new&#x02010;onset type 1 diabetes<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">108</xref>. Serum levels of circulating ICAM&#x02010;1 were also significantly increased in recent&#x02010;onset type 1 diabetes patients and their first&#x02010;degree relatives when compared with healthy controls<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. Among these subjects, soluble ICAM&#x02010;1 levels in prediabetics with positive autoantibodies were relatively higher than in patients with clinical diabetes, and were positively correlated with ICA and glutamicacid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA) values<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref>. These aforementioned advances, together with research reporting that neutrophils were found to infiltrate in the pancreatic islets, suggest that neutrophil&#x02013;endothelial cell interactions are undoubtedly involved in the accumulation of inflammatory neutrophils into the pancreas and the destruction of pancreatic islets, but the mechanism that controls the process remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12469-sec-0012"><title>Neutrophils and Platelets</title><p>Platelets and leukocytes, the latter of which consist of neutrophils, have been proven to regulate and influence each other's function by platelet&#x02013;leukocyte contact and releasing soluble effector mediators<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">109</xref>. Activated platelets promoted neutrophil activation and recruitment through expressing selectins, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">110</xref>.

It was also found that an increase of platelet&#x02013;neutrophil aggregation in patients with diabetes might be one of the factors leading to serious cardiovascular disease<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">120</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jdi12469-sec-0013"><title>Antineutrophil Therapy</title><p>The previous studies showed that neutrophils play important roles in the progression of autoimmune type 1 diabetes, raising the possibility that neutrophils might be a candidate for therapeutic interventions for the disease. The processes of neutrophil activation, binding to the endothelium, transendothelial migration, emigration into the pancreatic islet and release of cytotoxic products, are all potential targets towards which pharmacological therapy can be achieved. Therapies directed against neutrophil&#x02010;mediated injury in diabetes include direct inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and anti&#x02010;adhesion therapy.</p><p>Recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation into the pancreas is necessary for these cells to infiltrate in the pancreatic islet and bring about their effects. It was reported that macrophages and &#x003b2;&#x02010;cells recruit CXCR2&#x02010;expressing neutrophils by producing chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">98</xref>. Blockade of neutrophil recruitment by CXCR2 antagonist can depress diabetogenic T&#x02010;cell response and dampen the subsequent progression of autoimmune diabetes. As aforementioned, neutrophil adhesion to endothelial venules within pancreatic sections is an important early step in the inflammatory response, and is considered as one of the essential steps in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes. Therefore, blocking different adhesion molecules, such as selectins and integrins expressed on neutrophils by specific antagonists, might be an effective approach to reduce the migration of neutrophils to the inflamed pancreas, thus inhibiting the development of insulitis. Antibodies of anti&#x02010;L&#x02010;selectin and anti&#x02010;VLA&#x02010;4 were reported to delay the appearance of insulitis by inhibiting leukocyte adhesion to the inflamed blood vessels and interpreting the recruitment of leukocyte to the islets<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>. Administration of anti&#x02010;&#x003b1;4&#x02010;integrin and/or anti&#x02010;LFA&#x02010;1 antibodies has been found to lead to an inhibition of &#x003b2;&#x02010;cells destruction, and protect against spontaneous and adoptively transferred diabetes in NOD mice<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">121</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0122" ref-type="ref">122</xref>. Combination treatment with the two monoclonal antibodies might have a longer delayed influence in the initiation of diabetes<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>. Furthermore, long&#x02010;term inhibition of both LFA&#x02010;1 and &#x003b1;4&#x02010;integrin not only prevents diabetes during treatment, but also has a persistent resistance to the disease long after the interference has ceased, suggesting that adhesion molecule inhibition can reduce islet insulitis by affecting effector cell functions through stimulation of suppressor cells involved in immunoregulation<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>. In addition, a short&#x02010;term blockade of the LFA&#x02010;1/ICAM&#x02010;1 pathway at critical periods was shown to induce a unique peripheral tolerance against &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell Ag(s) at an early age in NOD mice, resulting in complete protection from autoimmune diabetes<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0123" ref-type="ref">123</xref>. Therefore, adhesion molecules, such as L&#x02010;selectin, VLA&#x02010;4 and LFA&#x02010;1, play significant roles in the development of type 1 diabetes, and the disease can be prevented by blocking these adhesion pathways. However, it is known that adhesion molecules are expressed not only on neutrophils, but also on lymphocytes, monocytes and natural killer cells<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0124" ref-type="ref">124</xref>. Studies have shown that anti&#x02010;LFA&#x02010;1 treatment can ameliorate neutrophil&#x02010;mediated injury by reducing the adhesion, recruitment, accumulation and infiltration of neutrophils into tissues<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0125" ref-type="ref">125</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0126" ref-type="ref">126</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">127</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0128" ref-type="ref">128</xref>. In addition, the activation of neutrophil respiratory burst can also be restricted by anti&#x02010;LFA&#x02010;1 interference<xref rid="jdi12469-bib-0129" ref-type="ref">129</xref>. Therefore, further exhaustive studies are required to better understand the preventive effects of neutrophil&#x02010;specific anti&#x02010;adhesion therapies in the progression of spontaneous diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12469-sec-0014"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Progress over the past decades shows that neutrophils play essential roles in the onset and progression of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Recently, exciting discoveries have provided new insights into the actions of neutrophils in the initiation of the disease, which found that neutrophils can induce type 1 diabetes through infiltrating into the pancreatic islets and interplaying with other immune cells. Unfortunately, only a few studies have specifically concentrated on the relationship between neutrophils and diabetes, though neutrophils are known to the most abundant cell type in the circulation and the first cells recruited to the site of inflammation. Detailed studies are required to elucidate how neutrophils are activated and recruited to cause damage to pancreatic islets through neutrophil&#x02010;derived toxic substances or interactions with other cells. A better understanding of the role of neutrophils in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis will provide additional information for early diagnosis, therapy and even for the prevention of the disease. Although many challenges still remain in exploring the correlation between neutrophils and autoimmune type 1 diabetes, it is an encouraging and interesting research topic that deserves to be focused on.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12469-sec-0016"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec>
