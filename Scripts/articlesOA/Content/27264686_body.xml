<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is a highly complex response initiated by the host to a large variety of stimuli such as damaged and dying cells, chemical irritants, injuries and pathogens. Inflammatory responses are critical because they not only alert cells to mount effective immune responses during infections but also initiate wound repair and healing programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> In contrast, excessive un-resolved inflammation can lead to tissue damage and disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Therefore, understanding the unique properties of a given inflammatory response is paramount to gain new perspectives on disease pathogenesis and novel treatment strategies.</p><p>Given the diversity of inflammation-inducing insults and variations in both exposure route and duration, qualitatively and quantitatively distinct inflammatory responses must be generated that are fine-tuned to achieve the optimal response to a given stimuli. Thus, each type of inflammatory response is comprised of unique sets of molecular events, lipid mediators, cytokines and specialized cell types that nucleate inflammation, followed by equally tuned steps to ensure resolution of inflammation. We suggest here that depending on the type of insult and the ensuing inflammatory response, distinct classes of inflammatory pathways can be delineated. Moreover, we propose that the innate cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and type I interferons (IFNs) are the pillars of two major types of inflammatory responses. We discuss how the type I IFNs and IL-1 cytokine pathways represent distinct and specialized classes of innate inflammatory responses and how these mediators antagonize each other. Moreover, we highlight how studies on the innate inflammatory response to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> infection, a major global health threat, uncovered key-aspects of this special antagonistic relationship between IL-1 and type I IFNs.</p></sec><sec><title>Interleukin-1 driven inflammatory responses</title><p>IL-1 is the prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokine and the classic fever-inducing endogenous pyrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> IL-1 mediates highly inflammatory responses via two cytokine species, IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, respectively, which can be expressed by most cell types and signals on cells of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic in origin.
