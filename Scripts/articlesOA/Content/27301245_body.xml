<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) presently ranks tuberculosis (TB) as the leading cause of death due to infectious disease worldwide, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths from TB in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) accounted for more than 3&#x000a0;% of newly diagnosed TB cases, and over 10&#x000a0;% (190,000) of all TB-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Further, 12&#x000a0;% of individuals diagnosed with TB were also co-infected with HIV, comprising more than 20&#x000a0;% (390,000) of deaths due to TB in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current WHO guidelines for MDR-TB treatment recommend the use of combination TB drug therapies that target <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>). These drugs, several of which have serious side effects, have to be taken for a period of 12&#x02013;18 months, with the long duration resulting in poor patient compliance. Furthermore, current MDR-TB treatment regimens cure only 50&#x000a0;% of MDR-TB cases and impose a huge financial toll on national health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other important limitations of current MDR-TB treatment include drug interactions and insufficient drug concentrations in patients&#x02019; lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] as well as aberrant or excess host inflammatory responses to <italic>M. tb</italic>, resulting in lung tissue destruction, compromising the body&#x02019;s ability to eradicate the <italic>M. tb</italic> bacilli, and leading to permanent lung tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Pulmonary pathology observed in patients with all forms of TB can be attributed to intrinsic exaggerated inflammatory responses to <italic>M. tb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since HIV co-infection is the major comorbidity associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with active TB, early restoration of immune cells in HIV-TB patients following antiretroviral therapy (ART) can result in the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In TB-IRIS, existing <italic>M. tb</italic>-specific T cells proliferate uncontrollably, consequently perpetrating local and systemic overt immune reactions and potentially leading to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-18, and interferons alpha and beta (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;), invariably perpetrate tissue damage in active TB as well as TB-IRIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although TB-IRIS is more closely associated with drug-susceptible TB patients starting on ART, it has been reported in South African patients with MDR-TB and HIV co-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An exigent need therefore exists to develop new strategies to treat and prevent harmful inflammatory responses in MDR/extensively drug resistant-TB patients to avoid long-term, if not permanent, lung damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Considering these limitations and intricate clinical scenarios in TB, host-directed therapies (HDTs) have emerged as a new and promising intervention avenue against all forms (drug-sensitive and drug-resistant) of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. HDTs generally target clinically relevant biological pathways in the host to modulate and rectify pathological immune responses. In TB, HDTs may neutralise excessive inflammation in organs and decrease <italic>M. tb</italic> proliferation while facilitating tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Therapeutic targeting of immunological and cellular processes in MDR-TB</title><p>Over the past several years, extensive preclinical and clinical studies have revealed a myriad of immunological pathways and biomarkers that either influence the outcome of <italic>M. tb</italic> infection or indicate the state of disease, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These pathways include cytokine-mediated signalling, intracellular antimicrobial processes, and establishment of long-term immunological memory as well as physiological homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The use of immunomodulatory agents as HDTs for TB treatment has therefore garnered great interest as a means of improving clinical outcome of therapy, based on previous experience with other infectious diseases and cancer.

Overt immune responses characterise the pathological outcome in tuberculosis (TB). Neutralisation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, VEGF and IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;, as well as anti-inflammatory IL-4 during severe pulmonary disease may help reduce ongoing parenchymal damage in the lung. Alternatively, suboptimal activation of anti-TB immune responses due to regulatory T cell activity can be reversed by the use of the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide. Drugs with anti-TB potential, such as metformin, imatinib, ibuprofen, zileuton, valproic acid, and vorinostat as well as nutraceuticals such as vitamin D3 not only abate bacterial burden via host-dependent mechanisms, but may also fine-tune the immune response to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>). These drugs increase phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria, improved emergency myeloid response and increased autophagic and apoptotic killing of bacteria, subsequently editing the T cell response in favour of the host.

For example, interventional use of glucocorticoid receptor agonists, i.e., prednisone and dexamethasone, has mortality-reducing effects in community-acquired pneumonia, concomitant with lowering of pro-inflammatory cytokine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the clinical outcome of prednisone therapy in pulmonary TB has been inconclusive; further studies are required to ascertain a clear beneficial effect in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Eicosanoid regulation dependent on arachidonic acid (ARA) metabolism has been associated with modulation of clinically relevant immune responses and pathology in patients with active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Two major arms of enzymatic reactions carry out ARA catabolism: the first involving cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX1 and 2) and the other, lipoxygenases (LO). Breakdown of ARA by COX enzymes progresses to prostaglandin synthesis, while LO metabolise ARA to produce leukotrienes, lipid mediators responsible for fever induction during active infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. COX2 is particularly associated with regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and inflammation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Leukotrienes are also involved in initiation of inflammation, angiogenesis and progression of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown in TB that balance between concentrations of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and leukotrienne B4 controls subsequent TNF-&#x003b1; release by activated immune cells in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Overproduction of LXA4 may instead cause immunosuppression, highlighting that maintenance of this axis in TB is pivotal in determining patient survival or death. The use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) inhibits COX2 activity, thus enhancing LXA4 synthesis, which in turn would decrease TNF-&#x003b1; levels and subsequently neutralise pulmonary inflammation in TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The same may be achieved with ibuprofen (another NSAID), which has been shown to improve survival of experimental mice with severe lung TB by dampening tissue pathology while reducing <italic>M. tb</italic> load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Ibuprofen also has direct anti-<italic>M. tb</italic> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Zileuton is an anti-inflammatory drug currently licensed for the treatment of asthma that exerts its effects by inhibiting 5-LO activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As opposed to NSAIDs, zileuton blocks LO-mediated leukotriene production, facilitating COX2 activation and PGE2 synthesis. In a mouse model of TB, zileuton was shown to dramatically abate IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; levels in the lung to improve lung pathology, in addition to reducing <italic>M. tb</italic> load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Statins can reduce IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated MHC-II upregulation, and thus CD4 T cell activation &#x02013; having clinical benefits in cardiac transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Statins may also downregulate TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; release via activation of the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), as well as reduce IL-6, IL-8 and CCL5 secretion by myeloid cells and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Prior use of statins has been shown to ameliorate inflammation-induced organ damage, thus reducing mortality among patients with sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The therapeutic potential of statins has been evaluated in TB.

Clinically, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on statin therapy (as well as anti-diabetic therapy) seem to be at lower risk of developing active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Metformin (MET) is an essential drug used in the treatment of T2DM, which acts by affecting the mitochondrial respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In a recent preclinical study, MET was evaluated as an adjunct therapeutic for drug-susceptible (DS)-TB and MDR-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. MET treatment induced superoxide anion production in macrophages infected with DS or MDR <italic>M. tb</italic> in an-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, MET therapy potentiated the activity of the first-line anti-TB drugs isoniazid and ethionamide in a mouse model of TB, commensurate with improved anti-TB CD8 T cell responses, reduced concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and lung pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A retrospective evaluation of patients with T2DM receiving MET therapy showed that they are less prone to develop cavitary pulmonary TB. In addition, T cell non-reactivity to ESAT-6 in a T-SPOT IFN-&#x003b3; assay also suggested less incidence of latent TB infection among these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Cell types expressing low amounts of aldehyde dehydrogenase are most susceptible to CP treatment since its enzymatic activity neutralises drug-derived cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high cellular levels of ATP-binding cassette B1, which binds CP, thus making these cells especially vulnerable to the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Conversely, aldehyde dehydrogenase overexpression can promote resistance to CP toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Prior CP administration to patients participating in a clinical trial of a renal cell cancer vaccine candidate (IMA901) led to Treg decline in peripheral blood of the participants, afforded better CD8 T cells priming and improved overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Histone acetylation mediated by HDIs has been clinically beneficial in cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) was licensed in 2006 for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and valproic acid (VPA, currently in use for epilepsy and bipolar disorder) is in clinical trials for solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], while many others are in late-stage clinical trials for a plethora of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].

The effectiveness of HDIs in infectious disease has been evaluated against HIV infection and West Nile virus infection. VPA or vorinostat treatment of CD4 T cells from individuals latently infected with HIV-1 can reactivate viral progeny, making virus-infected cells highly susceptible to ART as well as CD8 T cell-mediated immune attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. These observations have led to investigating the clinical efficacy of HDIs in HIV-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In a mouse model of West Nile virus infection, co-treatment of vorinostat with an experimental antiviral drug candidate ameliorated brain inflammation and neuronal damage in addition to reduction in viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Evaluation of phenylbutyrate (PBA), another HDI, against intracellular <italic>M. tb</italic> has been shown to potentiate pro-inflammatory signalling (upregulation of CASP1, IL12, and VDR genes, among others), antimicrobial peptide production, reduced <italic>M. tb</italic> survival, thus implying enhanced anti-TB&#x000a0;T cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Clinical evaluation of PBA and vitamin D3 treatment in patients with pulmonary TB resulted in quicker sputum smear conversion and increased production of cathelicidin by peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Blockade of cytokine signalling</title><p>As previously mentioned, the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, drives destructive immunopathology and severe lung disease in TB. The use of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy (adalimumab) in a patient with severe pulmonary TB proved to be life-saving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and set the stage for anti-cytokine therapy in clinical management of TB. IL-6, a major player in exacerbating disease severity in patients with TB, is another potential candidate for clinical blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], further confirmed by reduction of IL-6 serum levels in TB patients post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Preclinical evaluation of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade in a mouse model of TB improved specific anti-TB&#x000a0;T cell responses in conjunction with less severe pathology and reduced <italic>M. tb</italic> burden in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the IL-6/IL-6R pathway are currently endorsed for treatment of immune-mediated diseases such as idiopathic juvenile arthritis and Castleman&#x02019;s disease in humans (anti-IL-6, siltuximab; anti-IL-6R, tocilizumab) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and are currently under investigation for cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Blockade of the IL-6/IL-6R pathway may, therefore, be considered for clinical management of severe pulmonary MDR-TB. Preclinical evaluation of bevacizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody) in a rabbit model of TB showed that inhibition of VEGF-A was commensurate with modified angiogenesis in the granuloma, which improved penetration of a small molecule dye (representative of an anti-TB drug) as well as oxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Oehlers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] showed that VEGF promotes granuloma formation in <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected zebrafish, while pharmacological inhibition of VEGF activity with pazopanib reduced neovascularisation as well as the mycobacterial burden in the animals.

Further, VD3 has been implicated in immunological control of TB in humans involving orchestration of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-32 and IL-15 signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Recent evaluation of the therapeutic potential of VD3 in combination with PBA has shown improved anti-mycobacterial effects and faster conversion to AFB-negative sputum by the participating TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In vitro evaluation of <italic>M. tb</italic>-infected macrophages treated with VD3 resulted in upregulation of a collage of anti-inflammatory (IL-10, ARG1) and pro-inflammatory (IL1B, TNF) genes over a 72-hour exposure period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] &#x02013; this profile was relatively unchanged with PBA co-treatment. However, other clinical studies have not found a correlation between VD3 therapy and improved treatment outcome in TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].

This strategy activates and mobilises tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes as well as those in peripheral blood of patients with metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Although immunologically purposed to regulate T cell responses for avoiding immune hyper reactivity, PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression on tumour-specific T cells abrogates anti-tumour effector functions and renders the T cells irresponsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Tregs have abundant expression of PD-1 on their surface; interaction of this molecule with its ligands (PD-L1/2) on target cells leads to expansion and dampening of antigen-specific effector T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Importantly, a myriad of cytokines, including IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, type 1 interferons, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15, are actively involved in enhancing the expression of PD-1 on T cells and its ligands on antigen-presenting cells and tumour cells at sites of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. CTLA-4 binds to CD80 and/or CD86 to control the activation state of effector T cells in the aftermath of a successful immune response, and initiates tolerance by abrogating IL-2 production and downstream activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p>Results from clinical trials assessing monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab/nivolumab) and CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) in cancers other than melanoma, i.e., lung cancer and ovarian cancer, have been very promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab) has been fruitful also in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, resulting in a dramatic reduction in viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. There are several ongoing clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy (avelumab, MEDI4736) in cancer (e.g., but not limited to, NCT02572843, NCT02584829, NCT02588131, NCT02088112). Several clinical studies have evaluated the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in the pathogenesis of TB. PD-L1, the main ligand for PD-1, is markedly expressed on human macrophages upon infection with virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. In vitro blockade of PD-L1 with monoclonal antibodies induced IFN-&#x003b3;-triggered killing of the infected cells by autologous peripheral blood T cells from patients with pulmonary TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>].
