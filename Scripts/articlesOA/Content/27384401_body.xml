While the role of STAT3 was established in TB immune response, there is little information regarding its implication in the intracellular adaptation of the bacteria during the first hours following human macrophage infection. To address this question, we investigated the role of STAT3 signaling within human primary macrophages during the 24 first hours of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that STAT3 was quickly activated following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> uptake. Strikingly, STAT3 activation also occurred in bystander macrophages lacking intracellular <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. We showed that the rapid STAT3 activation is initiated by IL-10 signaling. We further identified that STAT3 repressed the early production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; as well as NO production.

To identify which of the two interleukines specifically stimulates STAT3 activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, hM&#x003a6; were treated with blocking anti-IL-6 and/or anti-IL-10 antibodies before being infected with H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>).

STAT3 has been previously described to play multiple roles during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Indeed, STAT3 is not only involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory response in myeloid cell but also in the differentiation and proliferation of inflammatory T-cells. However, the mechanism by which STAT3 modulates macrophage response, at the early stage of the infection, is still incomplete. We demonstrate here that the early activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 occur in primary human macrophages in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv infection and that STAT3 signaling spreads through cell-to-cell communication. Although IL-6 and IL-10 were both secreted in the first hours of infection, IL-10 mainly mediates the activation of STAT3 signaling in infected macrophages. It was previously reported that the distinction between IL-6- and IL-10-dependent STAT3 signaling was differentially modulated by SOCS3 which preferentially inhibit IL-6 receptor signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In contrast to IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) carries the signal transducer gp130 involved in the STAT3 phosphorylation. IL-6 signaling is selectively inhibited owing to the binding of SOCS3 to the IL-6R subunit gp130, which consequently blocks the IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3 while IL-10-dependent activation of STAT3 is not restricted by SOCS3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Similarly as STAT3, SOCS3 is expressed in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected human macrophages as early as 3&#x02009;hours post-infection and remains highly detectable up to 24&#x02009;hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). The IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> uptake suggests that the initial wave of STAT3 activation from IL-6 may be quickly blocked by SOCS3, giving priority to STAT3-induced anti-inflammatory response through IL-10 signaling. In the mouse model, the IL-10-dependent anti-inflammatory response requires STAT3 to activate the expression of genes involved in the expression of inflammatory genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Similarly to the mouse model, we demonstrated in human macrophages the crucial role of IL-10 in early STAT3 signaling, which then mediates an anti-inflammatory response aiming to antagonize pro-inflammatory signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. To avoid any misinterpretation due to the macrophage stress induced by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> uptake, we observed the consequence of STAT3 silencing 24&#x02009;hours post-infection. Accordingly, we found that abolition of early STAT3 signaling in macrophages strongly modifies the gene expression and the immune responses. In particular, abrogation of STAT3 signaling during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection led to an enormous increase in TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA levels, correlating with a higher secretion. Surprisingly, STAT3 silencing also led to a strong increase of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA production which contrasted with a really low detection of secreted IFN-&#x003b3;. The ability of myeloid cells, including primary macrophages, to produce IFN-&#x003b3; is controversial. One of the major concerns regarding the detection of IFN-&#x003b3; in primary macrophages is the possible contamination of macrophage cultures by lymphocytes. However, in our study, the method used to purify human macrophages provides a CD14+/CD206+ macrophage purity &#x0003e;99%. Moreover, several studies including some performed at single-cell level; point out the ability of macrophages and dendritic cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to various stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>In the early stage of infection, STAT3 also strongly represses the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, while enhancing secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10.

We also found that STAT3 controls the secretion of multiple immune factors such as MIP1&#x003b2;, IL-15, G-CSF and GM-CSF, which are involved in recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of dendritic cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes. In particular, G-CSF controls the production and mobilization of neutrophils. In addition to macrophages, neutrophils also constitute a first line of defense against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The STAT3 &#x02013;dependent repression of G-CSF release by macrophages suggests that STAT3 limits early migration of neutrophils at the infection site supporting that STAT3 may be essential for the coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses.</p><p>The IL-10 dependent anti-inflammatory response was proposed to be linked with the ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to evade the immune response and mediate long-term infection in the lungs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> produced several factors suppressing various cell death pathways such as apoptosis, pyroptosis or autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. On the macrophage side, inflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF-&#x003b1;, have been shown to increase macrophage defense against intracellular <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by inducing apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. We thus investigated the role of STAT3 in the regulation of genes involved in cell death/survival pathways. At the early stage of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, STAT3 signaling modulates macrophage response at transcriptional level and may participate to the control of macrophage stability. In particular, we showed that STAT3 negatively regulated expression of pro-necroptotic deubiquitinase Cylindromatosis (<italic>CYLD</italic>) and the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 modifying factor (<italic>BMF</italic>) in infected macrophages. In contrast, STAT3 also induced an up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes such as Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (<italic>BIRC3</italic>) and <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic>, also called Osteoprotegerin (<italic>OPG</italic>). Surprisingly, we did not observe a clear increase of macrophage death in absence of STAT3 signaling suggesting that other components are responsible for the complex regulation of infected-macrophage longevity. However, the implication of these genes upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> macrophage infection has not been previously reported, and their potential involvement in the regulation of human macrophage longevity during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection has to be further studied. Nonetheless, STAT3 has previously been described, in mouse model, as a strong modulator of cell death pathways, acting either as pro- or anti-apoptotic inducer suggesting that its pleiotropic function is conserved in human macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Among the anti-mycobacterial molecules produced by host macrophage, free radical NO is one of the most efficient ones capable to restrain <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In mice, NO plays a key role in innate immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Induction of NO production in IFN-&#x003b3;- or L-arginine-activated macrophages led to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth inhibition and killing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Consistently, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitors presented higher bacterial burden, mortality and tissue damages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.

In contrast to murine model, the role of NO in the inhibition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth is controversial in human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. For instance, neither exogenous IFN-&#x003b3; treatment nor competitive inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, by L-NMMA, have any effect on mycobacterial growth in human primary macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that NO production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected human macrophages or macrophage-like cell lines induces bacteriostatic activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. NO production in infected-alveolar macrophages from healthy control subjects was also shown to be correlated with inhibition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> intracellular growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. However, it is important to note that the authors observed marked variation between healthy subjects suggesting genetic background may influence antimycobacterial activity of NO. Although INF-&#x003b3;-induced NO in human macrophage provides a questionable effect on the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> intracellular growth, the induction of NO by exogenous vitamin D, or in combination with INF-&#x003b3;, presented a potent antimycobacterial activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. This suggests that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> susceptibility to NO may be dependent on the molecular cascade engaged. For instance, the antimycobacterial activity of Dipterinyl calcium pentahydrate (DCP), have been correlated with a MIP1&#x003b2;-dependent production of NO in human macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.</p><p>We demonstrated here that STAT3 repressed the expression and secretion of both IFN-&#x003b3; and MIP1&#x003b2;. Accordingly, we showed that STAT3 limited the production of intracellular NO in both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected and non-infected bystander human primary macrophages. Corroborating this, knock-down of STAT3 resulted in a significant increase of intracellular NO production which is correlated with a significant decrease of intracellular mycobacterial load.</p><p>According to our data, we propose that, in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected human macrophages, STAT3 regulates the expression of multiple cellular pathways, limits macrophage inflammatory response and controls NO production. The pleiotropic functions driven by STAT3 tend toward curbing macrophage response, which favors <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> intracellular adaptation. Furthermore, in absence of STAT3 signaling, virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> appeared to be more sensitive to NO suggesting that, in human macrophages, STAT3 may modulate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> susceptibility to nitric oxide.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Polyclonal rabbit anti-PY<sup>705</sup>-STAT3 (#9145), anti-STAT3 (#4904) and anti-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin (#2148) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
