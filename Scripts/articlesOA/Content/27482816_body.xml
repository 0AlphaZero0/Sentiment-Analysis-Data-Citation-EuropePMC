<sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cavitation of pulmonary lesions is a defining event in individuals with tuberculosis (TB), with negative implications for the individual and for society (<xref rid="DMM025643C2" ref-type="bibr">Benator et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C4" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C14" ref-type="bibr">Dorman et al., 2009</xref>). For the individual, cavitary TB is associated with poor treatment outcomes, including delayed sputum culture conversion, relapse after treatment and development of drug resistance. For society, cavitation greatly increases the risk of person-to-person transmission. For these reasons, more effective means to treat and prevent cavitary TB are crucial for efforts to shorten the duration of TB treatments, limit the development of drug resistance and reduce transmission. Such efforts would be aided immensely by better understanding of the processes leading to cavitation, and the factors driving reduced treatment responses in patients with cavitary TB.</p><p>Cavitation is a consequence of the distinctive caseation necrosis that is the pathological hallmark of human TB. As a result, efforts to develop animal models of cavitary TB have focused on species that exhibit caseation necrosis upon infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex, especially rabbits (<xref rid="DMM025643C10" ref-type="bibr">Converse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C39" ref-type="bibr">Manabe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C42" ref-type="bibr">Nedeltchev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C56" ref-type="bibr">Subbian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C58" ref-type="bibr">Via et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C63" ref-type="bibr">Wells and Lurie, 1941</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C65" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura, 1958</xref>) and non-human primates (NHPs) (<xref rid="DMM025643C8" ref-type="bibr">Capuano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C59" ref-type="bibr">Via et al., 2013</xref>). However, use of these larger animals is often cost prohibitive, and, in the case of rabbits, is challenged by the limited availability of reagents. Furthermore, these models require infection with specific strains (<xref rid="DMM025643C10" ref-type="bibr">Converse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C56" ref-type="bibr">Subbian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C59" ref-type="bibr">Via et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C63" ref-type="bibr">Wells and Lurie, 1941</xref>), prior sensitization with heat-killed bacilli, and/or bronchoscopic infection to create cavitary disease (<xref rid="DMM025643C42" ref-type="bibr">Nedeltchev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C65" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura, 1958</xref>). Even then, cavitation can be an infrequent event (<xref rid="DMM025643C37" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). A reliable murine model of cavitary TB would be much more economical and afford a wide array of reagents for investigation of disease mechanisms.</p><p>Mice have been overlooked as models of cavitary TB because commonly used mouse strains do not exhibit caseous pathology after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. However, C3HeB/FeJ mice were discovered to develop caseous lung lesions after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="DMM025643C48" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2005</xref>); these lesions are now known to be hypoxic (<xref rid="DMM025643C15" ref-type="bibr">Driver et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C22" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 2012</xref>) and to undergo calcification similar to human TB (<xref rid="DMM025643C45" ref-type="bibr">Ordonez et al., 2015a</xref>). C3HeB/FeJ mice are not deficient in the activation of Th1 cytokine-producing T-cells or their migration to the lungs, and they are able to control infection with Bacille Calmette&#x02013;Guerin vaccine strains (<xref rid="DMM025643C66" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2007</xref>). Their susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is determined primarily at the <italic>sst1</italic> locus, which regulates the macrophage innate immune response to infection with intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="DMM025643C48" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C49" ref-type="bibr">Pichugin et al., 2009</xref>). Macrophages of C3HeB/FeJ mice have a reduced ability to restrain multiplication of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and these cells preferentially undergo cell necrosis rather than apoptosis, which is associated with activation of the type I interferon pathway and an exaggerated host inflammatory response (<xref rid="DMM025643C23" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C48" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). Mounting evidence that type-I-interferon signaling pathways are upregulated in active TB (<xref rid="DMM025643C3" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>), as well as evidence associating TB with polymorphisms in <italic>SP110</italic>, the closest human homolog of the candidate <italic>Ipr1</italic> gene of the mouse <italic>sst1</italic> locus, indicates the likely relevance of this mouse strain (<xref rid="DMM025643C1" ref-type="bibr">Abhimanyu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C23" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C57" ref-type="bibr">Tosh et al., 2006</xref>).

However, to date, there has been no demonstration that cavitation can be produced consistently enough to support such usage. For this study, we utilized serial computed tomography (CT) imaging to detect pulmonary lesions and cavitation in C3HeB/FeJ mice after aerosol infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> while evaluating the impact of methods to promote cavity formation. Detailed post-mortem histopathological and immunological analyses were also performed to characterize the TB lesions and to probe for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are implicated in the process of cavitation (<xref rid="DMM025643C44" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C52" ref-type="bibr">Salgame, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Incidence of cavitary disease</title><p>In a series of experiments, C3HeB/FeJ mice infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv were imaged using CT at predetermined time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="DMM025643TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). In one experiment, 4 of 9 untreated mice imaged at 8&#x02005;weeks post-infection (wpi) had cavitary lesions. In other experiments, 14 of 31 mice and 10 of another 20 mice had cavities at 10 and 14&#x02005;wpi, respectively. Thus, the combined proportion of untreated mice developing cavities by 8-14&#x02005;weeks post-infection was 47% (28 of 60). Because cavitary disease is classically associated with reactivation TB, we also evaluated the incidence of cavitation during relapse after non-curative drug treatment. At 6 weeks after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv, mice received standard TB treatment [8&#x02005;weeks of rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide (RHZ), then another 4&#x02005;weeks of RH]. CT was performed 4&#x02005;weeks after completion of treatment (22&#x02005;wpi), at which time 11 of 18 (61%) mice had cavities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="DMM025643TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) (<xref rid="DMM025643C46" ref-type="bibr">Ordonez et al., 2015b</xref>). These mice (with cavitation) appeared substantially healthier than those that developed cavities in the context of untreated infection.

One-quarter of un-sensitized mice died within 44&#x02005;days post-infection (dpi), whereas no sensitized mouse died before 93&#x02005;dpi. The improved survival among sensitized mice was associated with better immune containment of infection.

Reliance upon <italic>M. bovis</italic> or specific <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages could limit generalizability to human TB. One example is the intrinsic resistance of <italic>M. bovis</italic> to pyrazinamide &#x02013; a first-line TB drug that is also a critical component of novel drug regimens under development. The impact of caseous pathology on pyrazinamide's activity and its contribution to combination chemotherapy has recently been elucidated in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice (<xref rid="DMM025643C34" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix et al., 2016a</xref>,<xref rid="DMM025643C35" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Similarly, sensitization with heat-killed bacilli and bronchoscopic <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection promotes cavitation in rabbits, but also increases the cost and complexity of the model.</p><p>We utilized serial CT imaging to rigorously quantify and characterize pulmonary cavitation in C3HeB/FeJ mice after aerosol infection with two <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains. Radiological imaging has been used extensively to assess pulmonary TB (<xref rid="DMM025643C11" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C31" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C37" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C46" ref-type="bibr">Ordonez et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C58" ref-type="bibr">Via et al., 2012</xref>) and, more recently, as a biomarker of treatment responses in humans (<xref rid="DMM025643C9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C51" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Austin et al., 2015</xref>). It is noninvasive and provides rapid, three-dimensional views of the whole organ. It also has the fundamental advantage of longitudinal assessments to monitor disease progression in the same individual, which could also provide new insights into the pathophysiology of disease that are not feasible with conventional methods. We observed pulmonary cavities in 47-61% of C3HeB/FeJ mice, a rate that may be ideal to study the factors associated with cavitation and the impact of cavitation on treatment outcomes. The cavitation rate after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> HN878 (East Asian lineage) infection (40%) was similar to that observed with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Euro-American lineage) (47%), although mice infected with HN878 were more likely to require euthanasia prior to the first imaging time point. Further work is needed to determine whether other <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains cause cavitation at similar rates. We also evaluated the effect of sensitization with heat-killed bacilli prior to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> HN878 (Beijing subfamily). Unlike prior observations in rabbits (<xref rid="DMM025643C42" ref-type="bibr">Nedeltchev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C65" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura, 1958</xref>), sensitization was protective in C3HeB/FeJ mice, leading to increased survival, lower pulmonary bacterial burdens, and lower rates of cavitation during progressive disease and relapse compared to un-sensitized animals. It is likely that the lower rates of cavitation in sensitized mice was the result of an immunizing effect of the sensitization procedure that restricted initial bacterial growth, as evidenced by the lower lung CFU counts of sensitized mice, and reduced the number and size of caseating lesions in favor of cellular granulomas that do not caseate and thus do not cavitate (<xref rid="DMM025643C25" ref-type="bibr">Irwin et al., 2015</xref>). BCG vaccination has been associated with reduced bacillary burden at the early stages of infection in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice, with delayed formation of necrotic granulomas (<xref rid="DMM025643C66" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that immunization in this model may delay, but not prevent, the formation of cavitary granulomas, as well. Additional longitudinal studies using live imaging are required to clarify the impact of immunization on the progression trajectories of individual granulomas. Similar responses that limit <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burden at the site of primary infection (mostly lungs) are noted in primary disease in children who were administered BCG (<xref rid="DMM025643C64" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2011</xref>). Rabbit models of cavitary TB in which sensitization promotes cavitation employ higher infectious doses (i.e. 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> CFU) that are delivered in a liquid vehicle to a small area of the lung by bronchoscope (<xref rid="DMM025643C31" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C42" ref-type="bibr">Nedeltchev et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, our study of the effect of sensitization in C3HeB/FeJ mice was limited to an infectious dose of &#x0003c;10<sup>2</sup> CFU distributed via aerosol throughout the lung. Because higher infectious doses might circumvent the initial growth-restrictive effect of prior sensitization, it would be premature to conclude that sensitization does not promote cavitation in C3HeB/FeJ mice until higher challenge doses closer to those used in sensitized rabbit models are studied.</p><p>Given that cavities are typically observed in adult (reactivation) TB (<xref rid="DMM025643C41" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Miller, 1993</xref>), we evaluated the incidence of cavitation after non-curative combination chemotherapy, and observed that 11 of 18 (61%) mice developed cavities. Importantly, mice developing cavities during relapse appeared to be substantially healthier than those that developed cavities in the context of untreated infection (e.g. less activity, ruffled fur, weight loss). Mice that were held for a further 4-8&#x02005;weeks after observing a cavity via imaging were seen to remain healthy, without clinical worsening, suggesting the potential for a chronic, cavitary TB model.</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is notable for complex interactions with the host. Multiple lesion types can occur simultaneously in the lungs of individuals with active disease, including pneumonic lesions, caseating and non-caseating granulomas, and cavitary lesions (<xref rid="DMM025643C24" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C36" ref-type="bibr">Lenaerts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C43" ref-type="bibr">Nuermberger, 2008</xref>). Softening of caseous lesions leading to liquefaction and cavitation is associated with explosive growth of tubercle bacilli, resulting in very high bacillary burdens (10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> CFU) (<xref rid="DMM025643C7" ref-type="bibr">Canetti, 1965</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C28" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2003</xref>), and with a significantly higher sputum bacillary load (<xref rid="DMM025643C47" ref-type="bibr">Palaci et al., 2007</xref>). If these lesions or their associated host microenvironments are important for the pathogenesis of human TB or the response to TB drug therapy, it may be essential to experiment in animals that can reliably replicate these pathological states. The cavities observed in C3HeB/FeJ mice share features of human TB &#x02013; air-filled lesions with caseous debris in various stages of liquefaction and mixed inflammatory cells lining the cavity wall, and encircling fibrotic rims. The cellular infiltrate lining the cavity wall is rich in macrophages (C11b+) and neutrophils (Gr-1+). Multinucleated giant cells and cholesterol crystals, characteristic of human TB lesions (<xref rid="DMM025643C24" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2011</xref>), are also observed. CT imaging revealed cavities communicating with major airways containing intraluminal cellular and necrotic debris with numerous intra- and extra-cellular acid-fast bacilli, indicating that the cavities in this model developed when liquefied caseum was evacuated from these lesions through the airways. Serial imaging and necropsies revealed cavities within the necrotic center of organized caseous lesions situated within larger zones of caseous pneumonia, findings described in other models of cavitary TB (<xref rid="DMM025643C31" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C59" ref-type="bibr">Via et al., 2013</xref>), and in affected humans (<xref rid="DMM025643C6" ref-type="bibr">Canetti, 1955</xref>). Moreover, lesions in various stages of development with multiple pathologies &#x02013; pneumonia, necrosis and cavitation &#x02013; were often seen within the lung tissue of the same mouse, suggesting lesion-specific progression of pathology as described in humans and NHPs (<xref rid="DMM025643C6" ref-type="bibr">Canetti, 1955</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C29" ref-type="bibr">Kaushal et al., 2012</xref>). However, the development of necrotic granulomas from progressive and coalescing pneumonic lesions cannot be entirely ruled out. The presence of multiple different pulmonary lesions in C3HeB/FeJ mice was described recently (<xref rid="DMM025643C25" ref-type="bibr">Irwin et al., 2015</xref>), but cavitation was a rare event under the conditions evaluated. Because several TB drugs with differing physicochemical properties have been shown to partition differently into these lesions in a manner similar to observations in humans and/or rabbits (<xref rid="DMM025643C12" ref-type="bibr">DeMarco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C26" ref-type="bibr">Irwin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C30" ref-type="bibr">Kjellsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C35" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C50" ref-type="bibr">Prideaux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C62" ref-type="bibr">Weinstein et al., 2012</xref>), and because the activity of some drugs might be modulated by conditions within large caseous lesions (<xref rid="DMM025643C33" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="DMM025643C34" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>), the more tractable and economical C3HeB/FeJ mouse model that exhibits these multiple lesion types provides an important new tool for TB drug development research.</p><p>Destruction of lung extracellular matrix is a prerequisite for cavity formation. MMPs, a family of zinc-dependent proteases, are known to degrade several components of the extracellular matrix (<xref rid="DMM025643C20" ref-type="bibr">Greenlee et al., 2007</xref>). The role of MMPs in TB is well summarized in recent reviews (<xref rid="DMM025643C44" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C52" ref-type="bibr">Salgame, 2011</xref>) and multiple MMPs have been associated with TB pathogenesis. In particular, previous studies have implicated MMP-1 (collagenase), MMP-9 (gelatinase) and MMP-7 (matrilysin) in active TB and cavitation (<xref rid="DMM025643C54" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). We qualitatively assessed MMP activity using optical imaging with MMPSense 680, an <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging agent activated by key MMPs, including MMP-9. Optical imaging clearly demonstrated MMP activity, which colocalized with TB lesions seen on gross pathology. Although wild-type mice do not express an ortholog of MMP-1 (<xref rid="DMM025643C16" ref-type="bibr">Elkington et al., 2011</xref>), they do express MMP-7 and MMP-9. The absence of an MMP-1 homolog in mice indicates that this MMP is not essential for cavity formation in this model. Therefore, other collagenases (MMP-8, MMP-13) may play a role in degrading the fibrillary collagen of the lung extracellular matrix in this mouse model. MMP-9 is known to degrade primarily collagen type IV present in the basement membrane of alveoli (<xref rid="DMM025643C19" ref-type="bibr">Gioia et al., 2009</xref>). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of MMP-9 surrounding cavitary lesions as well as in and around necrotic lesions, which decreased with TB treatment. This was corroborated by robust MMP-9 activity in infected lung tissues, which was abrogated by known MMP inhibitors (EDTA and doxycycline) (<xref rid="DMM025643C18" ref-type="bibr">Gendron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), as well as by a highly specific MMP-9 inhibitor, SB-3CT (<xref rid="DMM025643C21" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). These and other MMP-9 inhibitors warrant evaluation as inhibitors of cavitation and lung destruction during TB infection. We and others have previously demonstrated that necrotic TB lesions in C3HeB/FeJ mice are hypoxic (<xref rid="DMM025643C15" ref-type="bibr">Driver et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C22" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 2012</xref>), and MMP-7 is induced by hypoxia (<xref rid="DMM025643C5" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we also investigated MMP-7 in this model, which was similarly expressed surrounding cavitary and in and around necrotic lesions. Other MMPs (e.g. MMP-8) (<xref rid="DMM025643C53" ref-type="bibr">Sathyamoorthy et al., 2015</xref>) and proteases such as cathepsins (<xref rid="DMM025643C10" ref-type="bibr">Converse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C32" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="DMM025643C31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) may also have significant roles, and their evaluation will be the focus of future studies. Our results indicate that C3HeB/FeJ mice could also be useful to develop novel host-directed TB treatments, especially those targeting MMPs.</p><p>Given the well-established role of macrophages and growing evidence that neutrophils are also key mediators of inflammation in necrotic and cavitary TB lesions (<xref rid="DMM025643C3" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C13" ref-type="bibr">Dorhoi and Kaufmann, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C17" ref-type="bibr">Eum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C40" ref-type="bibr">Marzo et al., 2014</xref>), we evaluated the spatial location of MMPs and their relationship to macrophages and neutrophils <italic>in situ</italic> in three dimensions. Because MMPs are secreted extracellularly, they are not easily amenable to flow-cytometric analyses. Therefore, we immunostained and digitally scanned 36 consecutive sections through a pulmonary cavitary lesion from a representative <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mouse and re-constructed a three-dimensional stack with multiple channels. We analyzed high-resolution images from several consecutive sections across macroscopic dimensions to control for sampling bias. MMP-9 and MMP-7 demonstrated significant colocalization with CD11b+ cells (Chi-square <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), suggesting that macrophages are an important source of MMP-7 and MMP-9 in this model, and consistent with published literature (<xref rid="DMM025643C60" ref-type="bibr">Volkman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM025643C61" ref-type="bibr">Volpe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that C3HeB/FeJ mice reliably develop cavitary pulmonary TB after aerosol infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Serial CT imaging could non-invasively detect cavitary lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> and their communication with major airways. Post-mortem analyses demonstrated that pulmonary lesions in C3HeB/FeJ mice share several key pathological features of human TB, including the presence of multinucleated giant cells, and the simultaneous presence of multiple pathologies &#x02013; granulomatous pneumonia, necrosis and cavitation &#x02013; in the same animal. MMP-9 is significantly expressed in cavitary and necrotic lesions, and predominantly associated with CD11b+ cells.
