<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) continues to be a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2013 there were 9 million cases of active tuberculosis (TB) resulting in 1.5 million deaths worldwide, of these active TB cases approximately 15% were notified as extra-pulmonary TB [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Common sites of extra-pulmonary TB infection include the pleura, lymph nodes, meninges, bone and genito-urinary tract [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Extra-pulmonary TB can be challenging to diagnose compared to pulmonary TB as it is often not considered during clinical evaluation and diagnostic samples can be more difficult to obtain [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Whole genome expression analysis of human whole blood as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has been widely used to profile the host transcriptional response in active TB and identify potential biomarkers for use in diagnostics (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). An interferon-dominated 393 transcript signature was identified from human whole blood which was present in active TB and absent in the majority of healthy and latently infected individuals and was shown to correlate with the extent of radiographic lung disease [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This finding of enrichment for interferon signalling has since been reported in multiple subsequent studies [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other studies have, in addition to interferon signalling, identified immunological pathways that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of active TB such as TLR signalling, complement as well as enrichment for T- and B-cell function gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two large studies have included extra-pulmonary TB patients within their active TB cohort, but no sub-group analysis was undertaken to determine if there was a transcriptional signature unique to extra-pulmonary TB [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Sarcoidosis patients all had mediastinal disease with compatible histology and clinical/radiological features to support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and negative mycobacterial cultures.

TB in the UK tends to be diagnosed from the immigrant population, in particular those from the Indian subcontinent [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with extra-pulmonary TB being more common in those of Asian and African origin [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence the differences in ethnic composition between our clinical groups are likely to be due to a combination of these factors. These differences in group composition did not affect the transcriptional responses observed in our study. Similarly, whole blood cell composition in this study at the group level was found to be altered in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB compared to healthy controls with increased monocytes and granulocytes and decreased lymphocytes as has been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Extra-pulmonary TB represents <italic>Mtb</italic> infection which has spread haematogenously or via the lymphatic system from the lung. It is hypothesised that this spread happens during initial infection and that extra-pulmonary disease may represent reactivation rather than primary disease [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has long been recognised that there is variation in symptoms and bacterial load dependent on site of disease, hence differences in the transcriptional signature may reflect variation in bacterial burden at the site of disease [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], or in the site specific host immune response which may be reflected in the blood. Gene expression signatures of TB patients have previously been linked with bacterial burden, with a prior study showing reduced sensitivity of a whole genome expression derived disease risk score with decreased culture positivity in children [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Equally, with respect to complement which has been identified as one of the key findings in several microarray studies, <italic>C1q</italic> expression levels correlated with sputum smear positivity and diminished with treatment [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our findings of differences in MDTH (and symptoms) based on the site of disease may therefore be linked to differences in bacterial burden or the host site specific immune response. Integration of both host transcriptional response and more accurate quantitation of total mycobacterial burden may result in a better understanding of what drives the blood host transcriptional response.</p><p>Whilst it was possible to again here to distinguish pulmonary TB from sarcoidosis using our previously described gene set [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it was not possible to distinguish sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB by hierarchical clustering. The inability to distinguish sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB, is possibly due to the lower symptom status of mediastinal extra-pulmonary TB cohorts versus pulmonary TB cohorts. This would fit with our findings that the magnitude of the transcriptional response as measured from the blood is mainly associated with the presence or absence of symptoms. Previous studies which had identified differentially expressed genes between sarcoidosis and TB had used only pulmonary TB patients as their comparator group [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We show that compared to healthy controls the gene expression signature of TB (including pulmonary and extra-pulmonary patients) is very similar to sarcoidosis. We show that individuals from each disease state (Pulmonary TB, Extra-pulmonary TB or sarcoidosis) can lie anywhere along this spectrum of gene expression including some clustering together with healthy controls. However when taken at the group level differences in magnitude of expression can be observed between pulmonary TB and the other disease states.</p><p>Both TB and sarcoidosis are granulomatous diseases, and together with another granulomatous disease melioidosis they have been shown to have similar gene expression signatures to TB [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Despite these similarities, it may still be possible using clinical parameters and risk stratification to utilise mRNA expression based diagnostics to differentiate between diseases as has been done for active and latent TB [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>We show here for the first time that blood based transcriptional signatures in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB differ as a result of the symptom status and site of the disease in each individual. These findings have implications for design and implementation of mRNA expression tools to support diagnostics and treatment monitoring of TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162220.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Molecular Distance to health.</title><p>Molecular distance to health (MDTH) calculated for each individual (from 3409 transcripts which represent the transcripts of the 38 annotated modules shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162220.g002">Fig 2A</xref> (Control group for molecular scores&#x02013;healthy controls). <bold>(A)</bold> MDTH for TB patients by ethnicity (no significant difference between groups) (ISC; Indian sub-continent). <bold>(B)</bold> MDTH for extra-pulmonary patients&#x02013;there was no significant difference in MDTH status (Mann-whitney U) dependent on culture status.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162220.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162220.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Identity of 380 genes expressed in blood of active TB patients from metaanalysis distinguish active TB patients from healthy Controls.</title><p>List of genes identified in earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0162220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] now by by hierarchical clustering of the dataset (healthy controls, pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB patients only) revealed that this 380 meta-signature genes separate healthy controls from the majority of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB patients.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162220.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162220.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Numbers of patient within the cohorts of pulmonary TB, extra-pulmonary TB and sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162220.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162220.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Numbers of patients with different forms of TB in different body sites, their <italic>Mtb</italic> culture status, histology and clinical diagnosis status.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162220.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162220.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Lists of 694 commonly expressed genes in the blood of TB and sarcoid patients as compared to healthy controls; unique TB genes and unique sarcoid genes expressed in blood as compared to healthy controls.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162220.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec>
