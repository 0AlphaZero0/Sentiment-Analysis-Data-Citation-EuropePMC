It was determined that the hypovirulent CDC1551 was highly immunogenic which contributed to rapid and stable control of lung bacillary loads and subsequent improved survival. In contrast, the hypervirulent HN878 failed to induce a significant Th1 response which translated into increased bacilliary load and early death. This virulence was associated with the presence of a phenolic glycolipid (PGL) that was able to suppress proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-12,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> however it was eventually revealed that although it modulates the immune response, it does not itself confer hypervirulence.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Further research revealed that the cytokine response initiated by both hypo-and hypervirulent strains is not predictable (reviewed by<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>). Thus our understanding of the processes involved in the acute and chronic inflammatory response during TB infection is still inadequate and it is therefore necessary to find other components which may be associated with virulence. Much work has been performed in an attempt to define the immune response to infection,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4-7</sup></xref> however these studies focus on strains which differ genetically and therefore pin-pointing factors associated with virulence becomes challenging.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the early transcription profiles of the interplay between the host and 2 genetically closely related <italic>M.tb</italic> Beijing genotype strains with vastly different pathogenic characteristics. In doing so we were able to assess a subtle difference in the host response to infection with these strains. We also evaluated in more detail a select number of differentially regulated gene products in the context of their functional role during infection in a mouse <italic>in vitro</italic> model and repeated this with human THP-1 cells to ensure that the response we were observing was not species specific. We observe that during the early stages of infection, the hypervirulent strain induces a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine response characterized by the secretion of IL-6, IL-12B and IL-1B, as well as the RANTES. Additionally we isolated <italic>oasl1, ier3</italic> and <italic>saa3</italic> as early response genes that have largely unknown roles during <italic>M.tb</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The characterization of virulence in <italic>M.tb</italic> can be related to various bacterial cell components, however characterizing virulence in the context of the host response to infection is challenging. Studies attempting to elucidate a particular host response to hypo and hypervirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> infection have used strains that are not closely associated with one another and are often from entirely different lineages. Here we present an infection study using 2 closely related <italic>M.tb</italic> strains that possess very different pathogenic characteristics with regards to their ability to transmit and cause disease in humans and kill mice.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9-11</sup></xref> A previous study determined that mice infected with the hypervirulent Beijing strain did not survive 5 weeks post-infection whereas more than 80% of mice infected with the hypovirulent strain survived 4 months post-infection,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> indicating significant differences in virulence. Both of these strains are members of sublineage 7 and only differ by 2 IS6110 insertions,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> thus when comparing the 2 host responses, the differences we observe are more likely to be related to the virulent phenotype, thus excluding any other host responses which would otherwise be induced due to differences in lineage and other genotypical and phenotypical variances.</p><p>To this end, we assessed the early host response to infection (MOI = 1) with both strains using RNAseq at 12&#x000a0;h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). No significant difference was observed in the uptake of both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on filtered gene expression data with the circles representing individual samples that are visualized according to infection status (uninfected BMDMs, BMDMs infected with either R5527 hypervirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> or R1507 hypovirulent <italic>M.tb</italic>). PCA shows that each infection state (infected/uninfected) is distinctly clustered. Additionally, PCA indicates that the RNAseq-derived transcriptome profile of BMDMs infected with the closely related Beijing <italic>M.tb</italic> strains indicate a differential transcriptional host-response to infection. The adjacent heat map indicating differentially expressed genes was generated using 3 replicate samples of control (uninfected), BMDMs infected with hypervirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> and BMDMs infected with hypovirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). When comparing uninfected BMDMs (control) to BMDMs infected with hypervirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> using the filters described (Materials and Methods), 2241 differentially expressed genes were identified (Table&#x000a0;S1). When uninfected BMDMs were compared to BMDMs infected with hypovirulent <italic>M.tb</italic>, 2488 differentially expressed genes were identified (Table&#x000a0;S2). RNAseq comparisons of the 2 infected-state transcriptome profiles recovered 69 differentially expressed genes between the cell infection models (Table&#x000a0;S3).

</p><p>The canonical pathways were then compared in BMDMs infected with both strains. Canonical pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>) reveals activation of similar pathways during infection with both hypo and hypervirulent strains, apart from growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (Gadd45) signaling which is induced by infection with the hypervirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> strain. This family of genes, including <italic>Gadd45</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>Gadd45</italic>&#x003b2;, and <italic>Gadd45</italic>&#x003b3;, are stress sensors that modulate responses of mammalian cells to physiological stresses.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,13</sup></xref> It is thus growth inhibitory under conditions of stress and suggests that infection with the hypervirulent <italic>M.tb</italic> strain is perceived as threatening to the host cell, a response which is not observed by infection with the hypovirulent strain.

False discovery rates (FDR) were also calculated and only regions with a minimum coverage of at least one were considered. All data was normalized using the FPKM method. Only regions with a FDR &#x0003c; 0.05 and fold change &#x02265; 2 or &#x02264; &#x02212;2 were considered for hierarchical clustering. Both the samples and the genes were clustered.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-0006"><title>Pathway analyses</title><p>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) was used to assess the canonical pathways regulated during hypo- and hyperviruelnt <italic>M.tb</italic> infection in BMDM cells. Curated pathways from the IPA Knowledge Base that were significantly associated with the dataset were revealed as well as cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators and their predicted activation under the infection conditions described in Materials and Methods.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-0007"><title>Quantitative qPCR</title><p>For cDNA synthesis, 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g RNA was converted to cDNA using the Quantitect&#x000ae; Reverse Transcription Kit (Cat. No. 205311, Qiagen, Limburg, Netherlands). To ensure the removal of genomic DNA, &#x0201c;gDNA wipe-out buffer&#x0201d; was added to RNA (included in the kit) prior to the RNA conversion step. qPCR amplification was performed in 96-well plates and run on a LightCycler&#x000ae; 96 system (Roche, Germany). LightCycler&#x000ae; 480 SYBR Green I Master (Cat. No. 04887352001, Roche, Germany) was used for various differentially expressed genes using QuantiTect&#x000ae; primer assays (Qiagen, Limburg, Netherlands - See Supplementary Materials S1) at a reaction volume of 20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l. The reference genes <italic>ubc, b2m</italic> and <italic>g6pd</italic> were chosen according to stable expression levels from RNAseq data and confirmed through qPCR. The amplification procedure entailed 45 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;s followed by 60&#x000b0;C for 10s and finally 72&#x000b0;C for 10s. Gene expression fold-changes were computed for hypovirulent infected, hypervirulent infected and uninfected macrophages using calibrated normalized relative quantities using the equation N = N<sub>0</sub> &#x000d7; 2<sup>Cp</sup> (LightCycler&#x000ae;96 software, Roche). All qPCRs were done on RNA extracted from 3 additional experiments. All biological replicates were run in triplicate with a positive control (calibrator) and a non-reverse transcription control in accordance with the MIQE Guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-0008"><title>Cytokine and chemokine ELISAs</title><p>ELISArray for human (CMEH0707A) and Mouse (CME0708A) cytokines were purchased from Qiagen (Limburg, Netherlands) specific for TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-6, RANTES, MCP-1, IL-12, IL-1B, IL-10. After the infection period, cell culture medium was removed and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis.
