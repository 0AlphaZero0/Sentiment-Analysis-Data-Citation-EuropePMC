<sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> bacilli spread through the air, and the lung parenchyma is the main site of infection. Despite the availability of effective treatment, new tuberculosis (TB) cases are commonly mis- or under-diagnosed, leading to delayed initiation of chemotherapy and, consequently, to high morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Golub et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Belay et al., 2012</xref>). The diagnosis of pulmonary TB relies on the combination of clinical and epidemiological features associated with chest radiographic changes and microbiological findings (detection of acid-fast bacilli, culture growth or nucleic acid detection; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sia and Wieland, 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the sputum smear lacks in sensitivity (50&#x02013;70%), and the more sensitive culture (80&#x02013;89% sensitivity), the gold-standard method, is time consuming as 4&#x02013;8 weeks is required for visible colonies to appear (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Reichman and Hersfield, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sia and Wieland, 2011</xref>). The availability of commercial automated rapid molecular tests (Xpert<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> MTB/RIF) has overcome this problem, providing results within 2 h and showing moderate to high accuracy (61.1&#x02013;100% sensitivity; 90.9&#x02013;100% specificity; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Rachow et al., 2011</xref>). However, the use of any of these tests to investigate suspected cases of pulmonary TB is more complicated if sputum is of low quality or quantity, routinely requiring a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Khalil and Butt, 2015</xref>). Thus, the global search for fast, more accurate and non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for TB continues.</p><p>As the transcription of genes is a very dynamic process, modulation of their expression is the first major regulatory change in many biological processes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Riedmaier and Pfaffl, 2013</xref>). Correspondingly, prominent gene expression regulation has been found in blood cells of patients with pulmonary TB or LTBI (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Esterhuyse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Laux da Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zak et al., 2016</xref>). The potential applications of biomarkers for TB include not only the improvement of the current diagnostic tests, but also the possibility of assessing the response to drug therapy and targeted screening of eligible subjects for new TB vaccines and therapeutic trials. However, most previous exploratory attempts are based on array techniques for mRNA expression, which may have contributed to a high redundancy among studies, usually revealing mRNAs whose products correlate with the human immune response to TB: type-I and type-II interferon signaling, Toll-like receptors, T- and B-cell functions, and neutrophil influx (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Blankley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Deffur et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, even though some of the presented biomarkers/biosignatures showed high accuracy for TB detection, the lack of validations in cohorts from different geographical areas and/or the proposed use of combinations of a number of genes (from sets of 3 to 100s), hinder their use in clinical routine.</p><p>The advent of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) technology allowed the simultaneous measurement and profiling of the transcriptome of a biosample, avoiding biases introduced during microarray hybridization (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). The aim of the present study therefore was to identify new mRNA biomarkers for TB in whole blood specimens. For this purpose, in an exploratory investigation, a small set of recent close TB contacts (rCt) exposed to a bacillary index case, and TB patients, were submitted to whole blood transcriptomic profiling via RNAseq (unpublished data); the raw transcriptome data can be found at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession code GSE84076. Mining these data, highly prominent regulation of <italic>DOCK9, EPHA4</italic>, and <italic>NPC2</italic> mRNA expression was observed in the TB samples. Following a first validation by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in a cohort of rCt and TB cases from Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, expression data from previous microarray studies (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) were also used for an independent validation of these potential mRNA biomarkers in populations with different levels of TB incidence and diverse genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics Statements</title><p>The study protocol was approved under the registration codes 560-10, 183-10, and 190/12, by the Ethics Committee of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital (CFFUH) and Polyclinic Augusto do Amaral Peixoto (PAAP), respectively. Participation in this study was voluntary and only subjects &#x02265;18 years of age who gave informed written consent were eligible.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>All participants were recruited from March 2010 to November 2013 at CFFUH and PAAP, both located in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, a TB endemic area with an incidence rate of 60.9/100,000 inhabitants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Equipe Ger&#x000ea;ncia de Pneumologia Sanit&#x000e1;ria SES/RJ, 2014</xref>). Demographic characteristics were gathered via a structured questionnaire.</p><p>According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health policy recommendations for TB/LTBI screening, all rCt recruited underwent a clinical exam, the Mendel-Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST), and chest X-ray examination at enrollment (T<sub>0</sub>). Besides clinical and epidemiological data, the diagnostic criteria for TB among rCt or index cases were at least one acid-fast bacilli-positive sputum sample for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and/or positive sputum culture.</p><p>After TB was excluded, TST results were read after 72 h, and any rCt showing an induration &#x02265;5 mm were considered as LTBI. The rCt TST negative individuals (TST<sup>neg</sup>) were followed up and retested after 12 months (T<sub>12</sub>). For those rCt showing a positive TST (TST<sup>pos</sup>) or conversion (increase in induration of the TST reaction of at least 10 mm) at any time-point, a free-of-cost prophylactic treatment for LTBI (tLTBI) was offered, as well as the appropriate treatment for individuals who developed TB (TB progressors).</p><p>For the pilot RNAseq investigation a group of rCt from the Brazilian cohort was stratified according to the response to both TST and in house interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) under ESAT6:CFP10 stimulation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Araujo et al., 2014</xref>). Control and LTBI groups comprised 12 and 16 participants with TST<sup>neg</sup>/IGRA<sup>neg</sup> or TST<sup>pos</sup>/IGRA<sup>pos</sup>, respectively. Six confirmed TB cases were also included.</p><p>The validation by RT-qPCR was performed using a larger cohort of rCt where IGRA results were not available. As the participants presented different baseline and follow-up responses to TST, they were allocated into groups according to the probability of having LTBI: (i) G.I (<italic>n</italic> = 12), very low: no TST reaction (0 mm) at baseline and at any of the follow up retests; (ii) G.II (<italic>n</italic> = 24), low to moderate: baseline TST<sup>neg</sup> (0&#x02013;4 mm) who did not return for skin test re-evaluation (16/24, 67%) or converted to TST<sup>pos</sup> (8/24, 33%); and (iii) G.III (<italic>n</italic> = 48), high: baseline TST<sup>pos</sup> (TST &#x0003e; 5 mm). The majority of TB samples (26/45, 58%) were from treatment-naive participants, and together with those treated &#x02264;2 days comprise the group G.IV (<italic>n</italic> = 29). G.V (<italic>n</italic> = 12) comprises samples from TB cases with 3&#x02013;6 days of anti-TB treatment, and G.VI consists of samples from TB cases with 7 days (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 2) of anti-TB treatment.

(2010)</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-07-01586-g005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous whole blood genomic-scale studies pointed to a 144 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) or 393 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>) gene-transcript signature (including <italic>DOCK9</italic> and <italic>EPHA4</italic>) for TB, showing 61.7&#x02013;94.1% sensitivities and 93.8&#x02013;97% specificities (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the use of 100s of genes for transcriptional profiling in clinical practice is currently impractical. <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. (2011)</xref> proposed a smaller combination of genes, <italic>CXCL10. ATP10A</italic> and <italic>TLR6</italic>, which showed 71% sensitivity and 89% specificity to discriminate between latent and active TB. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2016)</xref> with a similar objective showed excellent AUROC ( = 1.0) for the comparisons between LTBI (<italic>n</italic> = 7) or active TB (<italic>n</italic> = 7) vs. HD (<italic>n</italic> = 7) using peripheral blood <italic>ASUN</italic> or <italic>PTPRC</italic> mRNA levels. Even though this accuracy was independently validated (AUROC &#x02265; 0.94), the assayed cohort had a small sample size (15 TB, 17 LTBI, and 15 HD; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In a separate study, gene expression differentiation between TB and other pulmonary diseases was also described, which was based on another set of three genes (<italic>GBP5. GZMA</italic>, and <italic>CD64</italic>) and had a 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Laux da Costa et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zak et al. (2016)</xref>, in a prospective African contact tracing study that featured a study design similar to ours (RNAseq for target-gene screening and RT-qPCR for biomarker validation), proposed a 16 gene-based transcriptional biosignature for risk of disease progression with 80.6% specificity, but with low sensitivity (66.1%) in the 12 months preceding TB diagnosis.</p><p>In the present study, we describe, for the first time, an up-regulation of <italic>NPC2</italic> mRNA levels in the blood of tuberculous subjects, as well as the transcription profiles of <italic>DOCK9. EPHA4</italic> and <italic>NPC2</italic> among Brazilians recently exposed to a TB index case. As 25% (1/4) of the untreated subjects from G.III progressed to active TB during the 1-year follow up period (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>), the prophylactic treatment might have compromised the evaluation of the proposed biomarker in the early detection of TB. Another limitation of this study is the lack of an unexposed control group among the Brazilian donors. However, in high TB-burden scenarios, as Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, it is difficult to rule out a previous exposure to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, even in subjects with no reported contact with a TB index case. To overcome this, we opted to group the enrolled participants according to baseline and follow up response to TST, a highly sensitive LTBI test (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Schluger and Burzynski, 2010</xref>), and evaluated HD expression profiles in other cohorts. Notably, a one-gene biosignature, <italic>NPC2</italic><sup>high</sup>, showed high sensitivity (85%) and specificity (92%), via RT-qPCR, for TB detection. In addition, a reanalysis of expression data from public repositories showed a similar sensitivity (82&#x02013;100%) and specificity (94&#x02013;97%) in populations with different genetic backgrounds (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, the monitoring of <italic>NPC2</italic> mRNA levels in blood could be used as a screening tool for the detection of active TB. On the other hand, by RT-qPCR or microarray reanalysis, <italic>DOCK9</italic> (13&#x02013;82%) and <italic>EPHA4</italic> (24&#x02013;75%) usually showed poor-to-moderate sensitivities but, interestingly, they exhibited a dichotomous median expression profile among the different TB groups in comparison to the respective control: down-modulation in populations from the UK and South Africa (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>), but the contrary among Brazilians (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref></bold>) and Germans (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). A bimodal <italic>DOCK9</italic> and <italic>EPHA4</italic> mRNA expression profile was also observed, principally in the TB groups from Brazil (G.IV and G.V, <bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref></bold>), UK cross-sectional (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref></bold>) and the follow up cohorts (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). This bimodal transcription, in response to physiological disturbances, was previously described for other genes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bessarabova et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, according to <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bessarabova et al. (2010)</xref> the presence of a bimodal gene expression profile could correspond to different disease subtypes. Thus, further studies are needed to assess whether different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains, infection sites, previous infections, host genetic background or co-morbidities can affect <italic>DOCK9</italic> and <italic>EPHA4</italic> mRNA expression profiles. Interestingly, this bimodal behavior was not observed for <italic>NPC2</italic>.</p><p>Anti-TB chemotherapy usually requires a 6-months standard regimen to eradicate the infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jindani et al., 2004</xref>). The observed change trend in the median expression levels for all target genes toward an uninfected control-like transcriptional profile, in the beginning of treatment (G.VI, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>), and more pronounced in the TB-T<sub>12</sub> group (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>), is an indication that these modulations are dependent on the presence of viable bacilli in the host system.</p><p>The exact physiological role of the dedicator of cytokinesis 9 (Dock9) protein has not been totally defined yet. According to <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gadea and Blangy (2014)</xref>, it is possible that Dock9 plays a role in the activation of Cdc42, a Rho GTPase that can affect TGF-beta1-mediated transcriptional responses. Dock9 has also been implicated in the epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the regulation of cell polarity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gadea and Blangy, 2014</xref>). Previous studies have pointed to the role of Epha4 and its receptor, Ephrin A1, in the process of lymphocyte and monocyte adhesion (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Poitz et al., 2015</xref>). The Eph/Ephrin-system, among others, was described to influence Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that these proteins have a common pathway in the recruitment of immune cells to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection sites.</p><p><italic>NPC2</italic> plays roles in cholesterol and glycolipid trafficking and/or transport, and mutations in it are causally related to Niemann-Pick disease, a life-threatening lysosomal storage disease (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2003</xref>), but studies on its role in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis are scarce. Recently, knockdown experiments demonstrated that adding all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA), the biologically active form of vitamin A, to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected human monocyte cultures resulted in an <italic>NPC2</italic>-dependent decrease in total cellular cholesterol, associated with a consequent increase in antimicrobial activity through lysosomal acidification (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wheelwright et al., 2014</xref>). The authors postulated that decreasing levels of <italic>NPC2</italic> expression might favor <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> persistence. In contrast, we observed an up-regulation of <italic>NPC2</italic> mRNA in whole blood from patients with active TB and LTBI subjects, indicating that increased <italic>NPC2</italic> expression is part of the host response to TB infection but does not confer protection in all cases. As we could observe in the incident case (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S2</xref></bold>), and in the subcohort of <italic>NPC2</italic><sup>high</sup> TB patients in whom disease progression could not be prevented, expression of this gene was still high. Our data indirectly demonstrate that upon the persistence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, systemic modulation of gene expression may occur even in asymptomatic, but latently infected subjects. Nonetheless, it is still necessary to investigate which genotypic or phenotypic features could be responsible for the <italic>NPC2</italic><sup>low</sup> expression profile in a few TB patients. Moreover, it is also necessary to clarify whether NPC2 up-regulation is specific for TB infection among patients with respiratory symptoms. In two of the reanalyzed studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) samples from other pulmonary diseases were also included (data not shown). The <italic>NPC2</italic><sup>high</sup> blood expression profile was detected in only 1/6 (17%) pneumonia patients and 1/8 (13%) lung cancer patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) but, in 50% (<italic>n</italic> = 9/18) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2012</xref>) and 56% (<italic>n</italic> = 9/16) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) of patients with active sarcoidosis. As sarcoidosis is a low incidence disease (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nunes et al., 2007</xref>), of which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is a possible aetiological agent (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">van Enschot and van Balkom, 2013</xref>), the observed relatively frequent detection of the <italic>NPC2</italic><sup>high</sup> biomarker should not compromise the application of this marker for the screening of active TB cases.</p><p>Considering the limitations of available routine methods for screening of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection among respiratory symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, which hamper the control of this important illness, the profiling of <italic>NPC2</italic> mRNA expression in blood seems to be an attractive alternative, since it has demonstrated an excellent accuracy using a fast methodology such as RT-qPCR for single-gene quantification in blood specimens. The additional similar results, obtained with populations of various genetic backgrounds and from different TB-burden scenarios, encourage us to stress the need for further validations of this biomarker in new cohorts, evaluating its modulation during disease progression and treatment success. In the meantime, the roles of <italic>DOCK9. EPHA4</italic>, and <italic>NPC2</italic> genes in TB pathogenesis also merit further investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LA, FP, and MS designed the study.
