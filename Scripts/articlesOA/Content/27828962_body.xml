<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infections with the protozoan parasites <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> or <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum (chagasi)</italic> result in clinical outcomes that range from asymptomatic infection to active visceral leishmaniasis (VL). When disease occurs, symptoms often include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cachexia, pancytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while the lethality of VL correlates with severe symptoms such as secondary infections, hemorrhage, liver failure and cardiotoxicity due to treatment [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Depressed cellular immunity is considered a hallmark of VL, which is evidenced by the inability of VL patients to develop a positive delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in Montenegro skin tests in spite of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with leishmanial antigens [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the other hand, whole blood assays showed that VL patients do not lack the ability to mount <italic>Leishmania</italic> specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, peripheral blood or splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes from VL patients produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to leishmanial antigens, which is also crucial to limit parasite replication in splenic aspirate cultures [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These findings indicate that progression of VL involves other molecular mechanisms besides failures in activation and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. Development and severity of VL have been associated with several pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory factors such as cytokines [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], lipopolysaccharide [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], mannan-binding lectin [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], C reactive protein and patterns of IgG Fc N-glycosylation [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, studies addressing features of infected asymptomatic individuals point towards a fine regulation of several immune compartments thought to control parasites without damage to the host [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, particular clinical outcomes after infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> are influenced by complex multi-factorial immunological processes.</p><p>Re-circulation between central and peripheral lymphoid organs has a major impact on effective immune responses and infections and inflammation cause cell migration via lymphatic and circulatory systems [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During physiological or pathological events in which factors are released systemically, features of peripheral cell re-circulation provide an informative platform to study the human immune system with molecular methods of genomic scale, which have been used to investigate blood transcriptional and immunological profiles during human infections, including parasitic diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Genome-wide profiling strategies have been employed to evaluate <italic>in vitro</italic> systems of infection with <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of VL [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while studies in humans are limited to biopsies from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Compared to uninfected controls or asymptomatic infected individuals, up-regulated DEGs from VL patients were enriched in pathways such as: "antigen presentation by MHC class I" (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005123.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), "differentiation and clonal expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells" and &#x0201c;Granzyme A signaling&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g002">Fig 2C</xref>&#x02014;left panel).

Moreover, these results also represent the first evidence of an increased activity of type I interferon signaling in humans infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Compared to VL patients, up-regulated DEGs from patients under remission were enriched in pathways such as: "integrin inside-out signaling in neutrophils", and "Notch signaling pathway" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g002">Fig 2C</xref>&#x02014;left panel).

Therefore, the transcriptional profiles of the study subjects were graphically represented for individual modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Those results demonstrate coordinated expression of genes retained in specific clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and also suggest differential activity of gene modules among distinct clinical-epidemiologic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To further address this question, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using WGCNA modules as customized gene sets and a FDR &#x0003c;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Compared to uninfected controls and asymptomatic individuals, we highlight that the transcriptional profiles of VL patients were associated with a positive regulation of gene modules annotated as: "TCR signaling and antigen presentation" (blue module) and "antigen presentation" (light-green); at the same time, transcriptional profiles of VL patients were associated with a negative regulation of gene modules annotated as: "cell adhesion and neutrophil migration" (brown module), "Notch signaling pathway" (gray60 module) and "cell adhesion and LTBR1 signaling" (light-cyan module) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Of note, a negative regulation of the module annotated as the "B lymphocyte related module" (salmon) was associated with the transcriptional profile of VL patients only when compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Noteworthy is the fact that a positive regulation of the cyan module (type I interferon, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005123.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) was also associated with the transcriptional profile of VL patients when compared to uninfected controls, however the same module was negatively regulated in VL patients when compared to asymptomatic individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Overall, compared with VL patients, uninfected controls or asymptomatic individuals, the transcriptional profiles of patients under remission were associated with a positive regulation of modules annotated as: "TCR signaling and antigen presentation" (blue module), "Notch signaling pathway" (Gray60 module) and "B lymphocyte related module" (salmon module) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Yet, the regulation of several modules associated with transcriptional profiles of patients under remission was dependent on specific comparison with the other clinical-epidemiologic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We also evaluated differences between the transcriptional profiles of asymptomatic individuals in comparison to those of uninfected controls using this same approach. We highlight associations with positive regulations of modules annotated as: "type I interferon signaling" (green-yellow module), "Notch signaling pathway" (gray60 module), "cell adhesion and LTBR1 signaling" (light-cyan module) and "antigen presentation" (light-green module) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>); Moreover, asymptomatic individuals exhibited negative regulation of modules as: "TCR signaling and antigen presentation" (blue module) and "B lymphocyte related module" (salmon) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0005123.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0005123.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Blood Transcription Modules (BTMs) associated with transcriptomic data from distinct states of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>.</title><p>Heat maps illustrate BTMs associated with transcriptional profiles according to each group comparison.

Of note, using this strategy we identified that, independently of the clinical outcome, infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> induces a transcriptional signature of type I interferon. However, this response exhibits a degree of association with distinct statuses of infection, whereby asymptomatic individuals presented with the strongest associations with activation of this module, followed by VL patients and then by patients under remission of disease.</p><p>We also employed GSEA (FDR &#x0003c;0.05) with a previously constructed framework of Blood Transcription Modules (BTMs) [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to expand the modular analyses obtained by WGCNA and further evaluate the association of transcriptional profiles with distinct status of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Thus, transcriptional profiles of VL patients were associated with a positive regulation of several modules mainly enriched in NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and type I interferon response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4C</xref>); and cell cycle, synthesis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). On the other hand, the transcriptional profiles of VL patients were associated with a negative regulation of several modules related to myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), B lymphocytes and effector responses such as cell adhesion and chemotaxis, immune activation with innate sensing and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Those results are in agreement with data from previous sections, demonstrating up-regulation of genes related to NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) or activation of T lymphocytes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">3</xref>), as well as for an overall down-regulation of the transcriptional activity of the innate immune response (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">3</xref>). Compared to VL patients, transcriptional profiles of patients under remission were mainly associated with a positive regulation of modules related to monocytes and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), as well as with a few effector pathways such as coagulation and complement systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). However, relative to uninfected controls and/or asymptomatic individuals, several of those same modules were actually down-regulated, whereby positive associations were found mainly for modules related to NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), both B and T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and to cell cycle, synthesis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Taken together, those data suggest that treatment induces significant recovery of circulation of neutrophils and monocytes, however not comparable to that seen in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the results suggest that after treatment, there is a more substantial circulation of both B and T lymphocytes, indicating that treatment might function by restoring a balance to adaptive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Additionally, compared to uninfected controls, transcriptional profiles of asymptomatic individuals were associated with a positive regulation of several innate immune cells, including those related to dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) whereas modules related to lymphocytes were mainly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, several modules related to effector and regulatory pathways were up-regulated in asymptomatic individuals and we highlight the up-regulation of all modules related to type I interferon response, which support the finding that those individuals indeed exhibit the strongest type I interferon response among distinct statuses of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Collectively, those data point to significant differences between blood transcriptional profiles which can reflect molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenic or protective responses during infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>.</p><p>Modular analyses are highly informative for capturing differences in immune-related processes during disease, however, recent work demonstrates that gene modules are not independent and are subjected to higher coordinated regulation [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In view of that we sought to understand the relationship among the BTMs that were associated to the transcriptional profiles evaluated in this study. Using PCA, we extracted scores from the principal component 1 (PC1) for each of the 101 modules depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4</xref> and performed a hierarchical clustering for coefficients of correlation among PC1 scores, which resulted in 5 main meta-modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005123.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We highlight meta-module II, which was highly enriched for modules depicting type I interferon signaling, dendritic cells and innate immune activation. Those results corroborate GSEA with BTMs. As an example, asymptomatic individuals indeed exhibited positive associations with several modules involving dendritic cells, innate immune activation and all modules related to type I interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>), suggesting a role for dendritic cells in the strong type I interferon signature observed in asymptomatic infection. Indeed, infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> induce a type I interferon signature in human dendritic cells, which is required for production of IL-12 [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, meta-module IV was highly enriched for modules involving B and T lymphocytes, as well as cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005123.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), which is in agreement with the proliferative characteristics of those cells. VL patients exhibited positive associations with modules depicting T lymphocytes and cell cycle, while patients under remission presented up-regulation of modules related to both B and T lymphocytes, as well as cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). As expected, those data indicate that BTMs are correlated and support the concept that infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> elicit the coordinated activity of a multi-factorial network of biological processes rather than perturbations in a particular compartment of the immune response.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Blood cell deconvolution</title><p>Whole blood presents a heterogeneous environment composed by numerous distinct, yet interacting cell populations, thus the transcriptional signatures from different states of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> could represent altered proportions of several cellular subsets. In view of these facts, we undertook a cell deconvolution analysis based on previously published cell signatures [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The expression signatures from erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes of each study subject are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5A</xref>. Compared to uninfected controls, the relative abundance of erythroblasts increased significantly in VL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, compared to uninfected controls and asymptomatic individuals, the relative abundance of monocytes and granulocytes decreased significantly in VL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Patients under remission exhibited an increase in the relative abundance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes only when compared to asymptomatic individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, compared to VL patients, uninfected controls or asymptomatic individuals, the relative abundance of B lymphocytes increased significantly in patients under remission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Of interest, the relative abundance of megakaryocytes, NK cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes did not change among the clinical-epidemiologic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Indeed, those results correlate with those of the modular analyses, which also demonstrate negative associations of myeloid cells with transcriptional profiles from VL patients and patients under remission of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), while modules related to B lymphocytes were highly associated with transcriptional profiles of patients under remission of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In view of that, it should be considered that the overall down-regulation of pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) or effector and regulatory modules (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">4C</xref>) related to the innate immune response observed for VL patients and patients under remission could be driven mainly by decreased proportions of circulating myeloid cells. This decrease, in turn, might be due to entrapment of these cells into the spleen/liver or even be related to defects of the bone marrow and release of cells into the circulation.</p><fig id="pntd.0005123.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0005123.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Blood cell deconvolution of transcriptomic data from states of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression signatures from erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes.

Using a genome-wide approach to investigate patterns of gene expression from whole blood, we identified transcriptional profiles that shed light on pathways and/or gene expression modules associated with distinct states of human infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. It is noteworthy that the transcriptional signatures identified in this study discriminated between VL patients from patients under remission of disease and healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Importantly, by assessing the levels of expressions of a set of target genes by RT-qPCR we validated the robustness of the expression data acquired by microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Transcriptional signatures from human samples have been shown to be sensitive to factors such as age and sex [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and sample size [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The groups evaluated in this study did not exhibit significant differences in distribution of age or sex. Similar numbers of patients infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>braziliensis</italic> and controls were evaluated by pioneering studies that not only identified unique transcriptional signatures, but were also able to recapitulate previously described immunopathological responses in lesions of individuals with cutaneous leishmaniasis [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Of note, samples from patients under remission of disease were collected during distinct time points after the beginning of therapy, which could influence their blood transcriptional profiles. Nonetheless, we were able to identify transcriptional signatures that segregated patients under remission of disease from VL patients before therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g001">Fig 1C</xref>); concomitantly, relative to asymptomatic individuals or uninfected controls, the majority of patients under remission of disease exhibited strong correlations of levels of expression for DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Furthermore, linear model-based statistical analysis and adjusted <italic>P</italic> values (FDR) did not detect significant differences between the transcriptional profiles of asymptomatic individuals and uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). However, uncorrected <italic>P</italic> values retrieved 620 differentially expressed probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005123.s005">S1 Data</xref>), which included probes for genes shown to be differentially expressed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These results demonstrate that, compared to uninfected controls, asymptomatic individuals present only a subset of differentially expressed genes, whereby the large number of comparisons between 17,105 probes [12,491 genes) can lead to a type II statistical error and inflate the rate of false negatives [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To overcome this issue, we conducted distinct approaches with the ability to estimate the differences between the transcriptional profiles of asymptomatic individuals and uninfected controls; the combination of distinct functional analyses and common features retrieved by them support the robustness of the immunological signatures identified for distinct states of infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Therefore, we propose that in-depth analysis of transcriptional profiles from such populations, as well as longitudinal studies including patients followed throughout treatment can be useful for the prospection of new biomarkers of VL or asymptomatic infection, as well as for the prognosis after treatment and remission of disease.</p><p>Previous analyses demonstrated that the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and dendritic cells (MDC) with <italic>Leishmania</italic> elicits both species and cell-specific expression signatures [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, macrophage cultures infected with species of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> complex exhibit an overall suppression of gene expression, suggesting a failure of proper macrophage activation [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the regulation of gene expression in MDM infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>chagasi</italic> was significantly impacted by the co-culture with autologous <italic>Leishmania-na&#x000ef;ve</italic> T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting that the inflammatory milieu of complex microenvironments such as the infection foci and peripheral blood influence the transcriptional programs of immune cells. Indeed, gene expression profiling of liver-resident macrophages (Kuppfer cells) from mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> identified a key transcriptomic network centered around the retinoid X receptor alpha, which was only active in bystander uninfected Kupffer cells exposed to the inflammatory factors in infected livers [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As observed for experimental VL [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], our study supports the view of compartmentalized responses, i.e., the dynamics of dominant pathways in specific cells of the spleen, liver, bone marrow and peripheral blood might be differentially associated with pro-inflammatory or regulatory processes during the course of the infection. For instance, there are strong evidences that IL-10 plays a role in the suppression of the response in the spleen of VL patients [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but, despite increased serum concentrations or production of IL-10 in whole blood assays [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and elevated expression of IL-10 found herein by RT-qPCR, we were unable to identify an up-regulation of the "IL-10 signaling" pathway in the peripheral blood of VL patients. On the other hand, we did identify a negative regulation of "IL-10 signaling" pathway in the transcriptional profiles of patients under remission, which might correlate with decreased levels of this cytokine and recovery after therapy [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>We highlight that, regardless of clinical status, expression data from individuals exposed to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> display positive regulations of pathways and gene modules related to "type I interferon signaling" when compared to uninfected individuals, suggesting that IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; might play important roles in infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Although the role of IFN-&#x003b3; in infections with <italic>Leishmania</italic> has been extensively explored, the function of type I interferon signaling is not clear [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Of note, transcriptomic profiling of lesions from patients infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>braziliensis</italic> identified a positive regulation of type I interferon signaling [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> induces a type I transcriptional signature in human dendritic cells [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], indicating common responses from both cutaneous and visceral infections with <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Of interest, our analyses suggest that the response induced by IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling might depend on the context and clinical status of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. In other words, while type I interferon signaling is elicited in both VL patients and asymptomatic individuals, it might present differential regulation of its transcriptional program in these two states of infection. In line with this concept, other work showed that only low doses of IFN-&#x003b2; protected BALB/c mice from progressive cutaneous disease [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Furthermore, the "type I interferon signaling" gene module identified herein is composed by some interferon regulatory factors (IRF), in which IRF-7 was shown to exhibit a crucial role for parasite control in mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, a fine regulation of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; expression and of the transcriptional programs induced by those cytokines could promote a protective response in asymptomatically infected individuals. In contrast, an unbalanced signaling by these cytokines during chronic VL can play a similar pathological role as that observed in infections with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Indeed, chronic exposure to type I interferon could impact homeostasis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] or even counter-regulate signaling by IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and limit protective mechanisms against infections with <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In addition, IFNAR-deficient mice present enhanced immunity against <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic>, which correlated with a critical role of neutrophils in parasite clearance [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The reason for such differences between VL patients and asymptomatic individuals might depend on several factors that include the genetic background of strains of both host and parasite, host nutritional status, history of exposure to vectors, co-infections with other pathogens, among other factors known to influence the magnitude and regulation of the immune response.</p><p>Although the expression data of VL patients seems to depict a general suppression of pathways and gene modules associated with innate immune response, a decrease in proportions neutrophils and monocytes was suggested by gene expression modular analyses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">4</xref>) and validated with cell decovolution analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5</xref>), prompting careful interpretation. Indeed, neutropenia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for death in children with VL [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], indicating that the low proportion of circulating granulocytes and monocytes translate into the down-regulation of genes coding for chemokine receptors and chemokines as <italic>CCR1</italic>, <italic>CXCR1</italic>, <italic>CXCL8</italic> or even neutrophil activation receptors as <italic>FPR1</italic>, <italic>C5AR1</italic>; in contrast, the up-regulation of <italic>IFNG</italic> underscores the increased levels of IFN-&#x003b3; present in serum from VL patients [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], whereas up-regulation of both <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> support the activation of T lymphocytes and development of a Th1 response during active disease [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Accordingly, we were unable to identify significant differences in the relative proportions of T lymphocytes from VL patients compared to other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), indicating that DEGs annotated into processes as TCR signaling were not influenced by the relative proportion of those cells.</p><p>Dysfunctional responses during chronic VL might originate from failures in proper antigen presentation and stimulation, indicated by the significant associations between polymorphisms in the HLA class II region and susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], as well as by the negative regulation of gene modules related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II identified in expression data from VL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005123.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Yet, the extensive up-regulation of pathways and gene modules related to TCR signaling and antigen presentation through MHC class I suggests a chronic stimulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes during VL and correlates with previous findings from studies that used different analytical approaches [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Persistent cross-linking of TCR and MHC class I without appropriate co-stimulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes results in an exhausted cellular phenotype, which is characterized by the expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, TIM3 and TIGIT [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Indeed, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes isolated from VL patients exhibit increased expression of inhibitory surface receptors [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We also identified increased expression of PD-1, CTLA-4 and LAG3 in expression data from VL patients, while expression of such genes was down-regulated in patients under remission of the disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005123.s005">S1 Data</xref>). Those findings suggest that perturbations in antigen presentation pathways may lead to inefficient activation and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, promote the exhaustion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and account for parasite evasion from the host response during VL.</p><p>Proper antigen presentation is crucial for T cell activation and differentiation, but other factors might impact lymphocyte function during VL. Indeed, T cell-specific deletion of Notch 1 and Notch 2 demonstrated that they are required for efficient development of Th1 immune responses and resistance in mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], thus polymorphisms affecting such molecules and transcriptional programs induced by their activation may influence T cell responses during infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Indeed, a genome-wide association study in mixed-breed dogs with VL identified a marker located between two predicted transcription factor binding sites that regulate the expression of <italic>TLE1</italic>, a molecule involved in the Notch signaling pathway [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Another perspective is given by the demonstration that Notch 1 signaling pathway drives the activation of mouse macrophages into a M1 phenotype through metabolic up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and attendant reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], molecules that are implicated in the killing of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>braziliensis</italic> by human classical monocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In the light of those findings, the positive associations between "Notch signaling pathway" with transcriptional profiles of patients under remission of disease and asymptomatic individuals support a protective role of this pathway in human infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>.</p><p>Cell deconvolution analysis corroborates previous investigations focused on lymphocyte proportions in peripheral blood of VL patients [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], whereby strong associations between transcriptional profiles of patients under remission with B lymphocyte-related modules likely reflect higher abundance of those cells in the peripheral blood after therapy [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Despite this, hypergammaglobulinemia is frequently observed in VL patients due to polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, modules related to B lymphocytes were mainly down-regulated in VL patients and asymptomatic individuals, which suggests that after infections with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>, activated B lymphocytes undergo differentiation to plasma cells and migrate to specific niches such as the bone marrow [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], while those remaining in the periphery might display unique transcriptional programs and functions. Indeed, follicular T cell-mediated regulation of the B lymphocyte compartment may account for beneficial or pathogenic responses during distinct states of infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], a hypothesis that is supported by significant differences in structural and functional features of immunoglobulin G isolated from VL patients and asymptomatic individuals [<xref rid="pntd.0005123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first attempt to screen for blood transcriptional signatures from distinct states of infection of humans with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Future studies including individuals of other populations, as well as investigations focused on specific pathways highlighted by these signatures shall confirm and extend the hypotheses discussed herein.
