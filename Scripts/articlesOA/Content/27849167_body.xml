<sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, causing &#x0223c;1.5 million deaths every year (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Despite the efforts devoted to the understanding of this disease, mechanisms determining whether protection or pathogenesis results from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection remain poorly understood. An in-depth understanding of these mechanisms is critical for the design of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of the immune response.</p><p>The initiation of the immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> relies on bacterial recognition by pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR, by host sentinel cells (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Recognition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> triggers the production of key cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial molecules that are crucial to activate microbicidal mechanisms in innate immune cells and for the establishment of the adaptive immune response, restriction of bacterial growth, and, ultimately, host resistance (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Among key cytokines produced by innate immune cells, IL-12 is critical for the induction of protective Th1 responses and IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In turn, IFN-&#x003b3; is crucial for full activation of macrophages, enhancing the production of cytokines and expression of microbicidal mediators, such as the inducible isoform of the enzyme NO synthase (NO synthase 2 [NOS2]) that is critical for controlling bacterial growth (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Indeed, mice deficient in IFN-&#x003b3; (<italic>Ifng<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice) or NOS2 (<italic>Nos2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice) are extremely susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, supporting the essential role of IFN-&#x003b3; and NO in immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Different strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> interact with host TLRs in a distinct way, which is likely to shape the downstream immune response and disease outcome. We recently showed that, although most of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains tested primarily activate TLR2, some activate TLR4 (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). TLR4 activation by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was found to result in the expression of host-protective factors (e.g., TNF, IFN-&#x003b3;, and NOS2) and to limit bacterial growth during in vivo infection (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Despite the protective role of TLR4, a hypervirulent strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> recognized predominantly by this receptor was also found to induce high levels of type I IFN during infection (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), a cytokine that was associated with exacerbated disease (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Infection with other hypervirulent strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> showed a correlation between increased levels of type I IFN and increased virulence in mouse models of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of mice deficient in the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) (<italic>Ifnar<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice) largely results in reduced bacterial load and/or increased survival compared with wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Additionally, overexpression of type I IFN during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection provided robust evidence for the detrimental effects of type I IFN during TB (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Induction of high levels of type I IFN by direct instillation of type I IFN (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or a type I IFN inducer (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) into the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>infected mice promoted disease severity. Abrogation of a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling increased host susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Coinfection of mice with influenza A virus and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resulted in increased bacterial loads in a type I IFN&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, a potential negative role for type I IFN was also revealed in human TB, because patients with active TB showed a prominent type I IFN&#x02013;inducible blood signature (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) that correlated with the extent of radiographic disease (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and that diminished upon successful treatment (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Thus, studies in mouse and humans highlight a potentially detrimental, rather than protective, role for type I IFN during TB (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms that mediate type I IFN&#x02013;dependent TB exacerbation are a major topic of investigation in the field (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Recent studies described that type I IFN suppresses the expression of protective proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF, and IL-12) while inducing the immune-suppressive cytokine IL-10 during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Generation and trafficking to the lung of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;permissive myeloid cells in response to induced type I IFN may also contribute to exacerbated disease (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Type I IFN also was shown to impair Th1 cell responses in in vivo mouse models (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and to inhibit IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced antimicrobial responses in murine macrophages (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and human monocytes (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The interplay between type I and type II IFN is further supported by a recent report by Desvignes et al. (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) describing an unanticipated protective role for type I IFN during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling. Mice deficient in both type I and type II IFNRs (<italic>Ifngr<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> &#x000d7; <italic>Ifnar<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice) showed increased pulmonary pathology and early mortality following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection compared with single type II IFNR&#x02013;deficient (<italic>Ifngr<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The investigators unmasked the involvement of type I IFN in the recruitment and/or survival of myeloid cells into the lungs and restriction of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of these cells when IFN-&#x003b3; signaling was absent (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). A putative protective role for type I IFN in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling also was suggested in human TB based on the observation that administration of type I IFN, together with multidrug antimycobacterial treatment, had beneficial effects against disseminated <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> infection in a patient with IFN-&#x003b3;R deficiency (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>In this article, we describe a novel mechanism for type I IFN in regulating macrophage activation during infection with a virulent strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling. Using a TLR4-activating virulent strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that induces high levels of type I IFN, we detected increased levels of arginase 1 (<italic>Arg1</italic>) gene expression in the lungs, along with other genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages, when IFNAR signaling was abrogated in IFN-&#x003b3;R&#x02013;deficient mice following in vivo infection. This correlated with increased lung bacterial loads and pathology, as well as increased Th2-associated cytokines and decreased TNF levels. Thus, our data indicate that suppression of alternative macrophage activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection by type I IFN confers protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations of the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU and were previously approved by the Portuguese National Authority for Animal Health (Dire&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Geral de Alimenta&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e Veterin&#x000e1;ria).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 WT mice and knockout (KO) mice (all backcrossed &#x02265;10 generations to the C57BL/6 background) were bred and housed at the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS) (WT, <italic>Tlr2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice), Instituto de Investiga&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e Inova&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o em Sa&#x000fa;de (WT, <italic>Tnf</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice), and at The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory (WT, <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Ifngr<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice). <italic>Ifngr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were crossed to obtain double-KO (dKO) mutant mice (<italic>Ifngr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>).

TLR2 deficiency led to a minor reduction in nitrite concentrations; however, the lack of TLR4 nearly completely abrogated NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>). In line with this, <italic>Nos2</italic> transcription was also greatly reduced at 6 h postinfection in <italic>Tlr4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Ticam<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages, but not in <italic>Tlr2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages, compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 2B, 2C</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>Nos2</italic> expression and NO production was a direct effect of the mycobacteria, because production of NO by BTB 02-171&#x02013;infected macrophages was not affected by a concentration of polymyxin B (an endotoxin inhibitor) that completely abrogated NO production by macrophages stimulated with 500 ng/ml of LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 2D</xref>). TLR4-dependent <italic>Nos2</italic> induction and NO production by infected macrophages were also observed postinfection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain Harlingen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 2E, 2F</xref>), which also was described as a TLR4-activating strain (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These data suggest that TLR4 activation and the downstream TRIF pathway are required to initiate the signaling cascade involved in the upregulation of <italic>Nos2</italic> and NO production by macrophages infected with certain strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that signal through TLR4 and are known to induce type I IFN production by infected macrophages.</p><fig id="fig02" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p>Type I IFN induces <italic>Nos2</italic> expression and NO production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages.

Because both IFNs can induce <italic>Nos2</italic> transcription, we next investigated their relative contribution to NO production in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We infected WT macrophages with the BTB 02-171 strain in the presence of rIFN-&#x003b3; at the time of infection. Enhanced NO production was observed in infected macrophages treated with IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2H</xref>). <italic>Nos2</italic> mRNA levels were also higher in infected macrophages treated with IFN-&#x003b3; compared with untreated macrophages at 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2I</xref>), although similar levels were detected at earlier times postinfection (3 and 6 h). These findings suggest that both IFNs, macrophage-derived type I IFN and exogenous IFN-&#x003b3;, may cooperate for maximal <italic>Nos2</italic> induction or that IFN-&#x003b3; may induce higher levels of <italic>Nos2</italic> than type I IFN upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we infected WT macrophages with the H37Rv strain and added IFN-&#x003b2; or IFN-&#x003b3; at the time of infection. Although IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; induced NO production by H37Rv-infected macrophages, IFN-&#x003b3; was significantly more potent than maximal doses of IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2J</xref>). Similar levels of <italic>Nos2</italic> mRNA were induced by IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; early postinfection (up to 6 h); however, although we observed a plateau in <italic>Nos2</italic> levels between 6 and 12 h postinfection in the presence of IFN-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3; continued to increase the levels of <italic>Nos2</italic> transcription after 6 h postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2K</xref>).

However, in particular cases, such as in multidrug resistant TB patients treated with antimycobacterial drugs (<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) or in patients with mutations in their IFN-&#x003b3;R suffering from mycobacterial infections (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), type I IFN could provide some level of protection. Thus, unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying this protective role may offer new targets for host-direct therapies in these individuals. In the mouse model of infection, a protective role was attributed to type I IFN, in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent immunity, by influencing the recruitment and/or survival of potential target cells in infected lungs (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In this article, we describe a previously unappreciated role for type I IFN in regulating macrophage activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, revealing a novel mechanism by which type I IFN may confer protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that type I IFN induces <italic>Nos2</italic> and inhibits <italic>Arg1</italic> expression following infection of macrophages with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, resulting in high NO production by infected macrophages. The suppression of <italic>Arg1</italic> expression by type I IFN, and indeed of other genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages, was also observed during in vivo infection in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling. These alterations correlated with control of bacterial growth and pathology. Taken together, our data show that, although masked by the dominant effect of IFN-&#x003b3;, type I IFN has a regulatory function in macrophage activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection; it contributes to host protection by suppressing the switching of macrophages from a more protective, classically activated phenotype to a more permissive, alternatively activated phenotype.</p><p>Mutations in both IFN-&#x003b3;R chains, <italic>IFNGR1</italic> and <italic>IFNGR2</italic>, were identified in humans and have been associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

Our results provide important information that may help to explain the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of IFN-&#x003b1; treatment and provide novel targets for host-directed therapy to improve future treatment of patients with IFN-&#x003b3;R mutations or with compromised IFN-&#x003b3; responses.</p><p>NO synthesis by NOS2 is critical for effective immunity and host protection against virulent strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Although <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain BTB 02-171 induces strong <italic>Nos2</italic> expression early after in vivo infection, this strain still causes severe disease, as shown by increased bacterial loads and enhanced lung pathology (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In some bacterial infections, an exacerbated expression of NOS2 was associated with a more severe disease outcome, likely due to NO-mediated cytotoxicity and tissue damage and suppression of the immune response to the pathogen (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Although we cannot completely exclude the hypothesis that elevated <italic>Nos2</italic> expression can contribute to disease severity during infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain BTB 02-171, mice deficient for NOS2 were extremely susceptible to infection with this strain. Additionally, compared with the less virulent laboratory strain H37Rv, <italic>Nos2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice showed earlier susceptibility to BTB 02-171 infection that correlates with earlier induction of elevated levels of <italic>Nos2</italic> expression following infection with this strain. Temporal differences in <italic>Nos2</italic> induction following infection with different strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may explain previous reports showing a protective role for NOS2 during the late, but not the early, phase of infection (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that the expression of <italic>Nos2</italic> in macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain BTB 02-171 was independent of the presence of IFN-&#x003b3;, a key cytokine for activation of macrophages during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection to produce large amounts of NO (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). We then investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;independent <italic>Nos2</italic> induction and NO production and found a requirement for TLR4/TRIF signaling. Type I IFN was reported to contribute to the induction of NO production following stimulation of macrophages with the TLR4 ligand LPS (<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). We found that type I IFN signaling was required for transcriptional induction of <italic>Nos2</italic> and consequent NO production in macrophages infected with BTB 02-171. Furthermore, addition of IFN-&#x003b2; significantly enhanced NO production following infection with the H37Rv strain, which, on its own, induced little production of NO by infected macrophages.</p><p>Nevertheless, our results show that IFN-&#x003b3; is a stronger inducer of NO production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages than type I IFN, likely due to prolonged transcriptional induction of <italic>Nos2</italic>. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced NOS2, but not type I IFN&#x02013;induced NOS2, appears to be required for efficient bacterial control by macrophages. We reported previously that type I IFN impairs IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02019;s effects on cytokine production by macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Type I IFN completely abrogated the ability of IFN-&#x003b3; to enhance IL-12 and TNF production and to inhibit IL-10 production by macrophages in response to H37Rv infection, although it did not impair IFN-&#x003b3; inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We now show that type I IFN can also downregulate IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent induction of NO production by infected macrophages. Because IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; production during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection seems to be mediated by <italic>Nos2</italic> (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), our recent finding may explain why the ability of IFN-&#x003b3; to suppress IL-1&#x003b2; production by infected macrophages was indeed increased by the presence of type I IFN (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Although IL-10 is an important mediator of the suppressive effect of type I IFN on IL-12 and TNF macrophage production induced by IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-10 did not play a role in suppressing the IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent induction of NO production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages (data not shown).</p><p>We report in this article that, in vivo, <italic>Nos2</italic> expression required IFN-&#x003b3; signaling because <italic>Nos2</italic> mRNA levels were significantly lower in infected lungs from mice deficient for IFN-&#x003b3;R compared with WT mice, in agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Type I IFN inhibited IFN-&#x003b3;<italic>&#x02013;</italic>induced <italic>Nos2</italic> transcription slightly, in line with our in vitro data and with another study reporting an IFNAR-mediated inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced NOS2 expression in lung myeloid cells (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, type I IFN&#x02013;dependent <italic>Nos2</italic> induction was not detected in infected lungs at the time points analyzed postinfection. One explanation is that type I IFN&#x02013;induced <italic>Nos2</italic> transcription is transient and not sustained over time, in contrast to IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent <italic>Nos2</italic> induction. This hypothesis is supported by our in vitro data showing that, although both type I and type II IFNs induced similar levels of <italic>Nos2</italic> early following macrophage infection, increased levels of <italic>Nos2</italic> were only sustained over time in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3;. <italic>Nos2</italic> induction was reported to be critical to control neutrophil-mediated pulmonary pathology following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Therefore, induction of <italic>Nos2</italic> by type I IFN (even if transient or in low levels) could explain the increased numbers of neutrophils and enhanced lung pathology observed in the absence of both IFN-&#x003b3;R and IFNAR. In addition to enhanced pathology, we observed increased lung bacterial loads in the absence of both IFN-&#x003b3;R and IFNAR, compared with the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R alone, which contrasts with a previous study of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain H37Rv (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> used in this study, BTB 02-171, is more virulent and induces higher levels of type I IFN in the lungs of infected mice than does the H37Rv strain (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which may account for some of the differences observed between the previous study and ours (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>The increased susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection that we observed in the absence of both IFN-&#x003b3;R and IFNAR signaling correlated with increased expression levels of genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages, such as <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Ym1</italic>, and <italic>Fizz1</italic>, in the lungs. A positive correlation between ARG1 and human TB was suggested recently based on the increased expression of <italic>ARG1</italic> in monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of patients with active TB compared with those with latent TB (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). ARG1 was also reported to be expressed in granuloma-associated macrophages of lung tissues from patients with TB (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Likewise, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection can induce <italic>Arg1</italic> expression in murine macrophages (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), and specific elimination of <italic>Arg1</italic> in macrophages decreased lung bacterial loads during in vivo infection (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). How macrophage expression of <italic>Arg1</italic> during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection increases susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection remains unclear. It was suggested that ARG1 impairs bacterial growth restriction by infected macrophages by suppressing NOS2 activity and preventing NO production (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), which could be part of the mechanism observed in our study of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R and IFNAR signaling. As another mechanism, we consider the possibility that ARG1 activity may supply substrates for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth and survival, as was suggested for <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>).</p><p>Alternative macrophage activation is typically induced by IL-4R&#x003b1; activation (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages with IL-4 in vitro was reported to inhibit macrophage antimicrobial responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Moreover, Th2 cell responses were associated with TB pathogenesis by mediating the alternative activation of macrophages during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). We detected increased levels of Th2-associated cytokines in infected lungs in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R, which were further enhanced by the concomitant absence of IFNAR, suggesting that increased IL-4R&#x003b1; signaling may drive alternative activation of lung macrophages in <italic>Ifngr<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and dKO mice. In addition, decreased levels of TNF expression were detected in the absence of both IFN-&#x003b3;R and IFNAR. TNF was recently shown to hamper alternative activation of macrophages in murine models of cancer by suppressing Th2-associated cytokine expression (<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Although the effect of TNF on the expression of Th2-associated cytokines remains to be clarified in our in vivo model, our data show that TNF directly inhibits <italic>Arg1</italic> expression in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages. In contrast, IL-10 is required for maximal induction of <italic>Arg1</italic> expression in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages in vitro. Overexpression of IL-10 by macrophages and monocytes (under control of the CD68 promoter) was shown to induce the expression of <italic>Arg1</italic> and other markers associated with alternative macrophage activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, increasing host susceptibility to TB (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). However, similar levels of IL-10 expression were detected in infected lungs in the presence or absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R and IFNAR, suggesting that IL-10 does not play a major role in the regulation of <italic>Arg1</italic> expression in our in vivo model. Type I IFN inhibits <italic>Arg1</italic> expression by infected macrophages in our in vitro model, in which Th2-associated cytokines are absent, and TNF production was not affected by the absence of IFNAR. These findings point to a direct suppressor function of type I IFN on the transcriptional induction of <italic>Arg1</italic> in macrophages following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Therefore, during in vivo infection, <italic>Arg1</italic> expression may be directly inhibited by type I IFN signaling and indirectly inhibited by type I IFN&#x02013;dependent regulation of TNF and Th2-associated cytokine expression.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that inhibition of alternative macrophage activation by type I IFN correlates with control of bacterial growth and pathology during infection with a virulent strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R.

Moreover, in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R, IFNAR signaling inhibits the expression of Th2-associated cytokines and enhances TNF expression in infected lungs, which likely further contributes to the suppression of alternative macrophage activation in vivo. In addition to furthering our understanding of the modulation of macrophage activation during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, these data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which type I IFN, in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;R, may confer protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection; this offers new avenues to develop host-direct therapies for patients with compromised IFN-&#x003b3; responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="DC1"><label>Data Supplement</label><media id="d35e301" xlink:href="JI_1600584.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec>
