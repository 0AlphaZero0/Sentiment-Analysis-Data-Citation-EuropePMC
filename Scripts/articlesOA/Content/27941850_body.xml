<p>The emerging epidemic of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) calls for new treatment strategies.

The current tools for monitoring treatment of pulmonary TB are limited to clinical assessments of signs/symptoms, assessment of regular inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and white blood cells), radiological changes, and repeated sampling of respiratory specimen to detect the presence of <italic>Mtb</italic> and their viability. The conversion of positive to negative <italic>Mtb</italic>-culture after 2 months treatment is the only validated predictor of the required duration of treatement and the risk of relapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Notably, this biomarker has evident limitations in children as only 30% of TB cases are culture positive at diagnosis. Recent evidence suggests that blood transcriptomes are sensitive markers of immunological changes as early as 1&#x02013;2 weeks after initiation of ATT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. At diagnosis, TB patients are highly diverse when it comes to the manifestations and extent of disease which to some degree is reflected in smear positivity, <italic>Mtb-</italic>culture positivity, cavitating disease and weight, all prognostic factors of treatment response. There is a substantial body of evidence that the greater the extent of TB disease and the bacterial load in the sputum at diagnosis, the higher the risk for treatment failure or relapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Therefore, biomarkers which reflect the extent of disease are likely to have a potential to predict the ATT treatment outcome relevant to adequate individual management and prevention of multi-drug resistance. Genome-wide analysis of transcriptomes are increasingly applied in studies aiming to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers relevant to TB management. Surprisingly, except for <italic>Anderson et al</italic>. who addressed disease extent in pediatric TB according to a diagnostic algorithm that takes into account the high number of unconfirmed cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, the association between transcripts that change on treatment and the extent of TB disease at diagnosis and end of treatment has not been systematically addressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, within the setting of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled longitudinal trial (rct) carried out to assess the effect of micronutrient supplementation in children with intrathoracic TB treated with ATT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, the present study was set up to explore 1) the association between transcriptional and translational biomarkers in WB and the extent of TB disease at diagnosis and treatment outcomes at 2 and 6 months, and 2) the potential of the biomarkers to predict treatment response at 2 and 6 months.

The three genes for which expression was down-regulated during treatment (<italic>FCGR1A, FPR1</italic> and <italic>MMP9)</italic> exhibited a positive correlation with the extent of TB disease indicating that higher levels of these transcripts probably reflect the extent of TB-induced pathology, and may be indicative of bacterial load. The 8 genes that were up-regulated during treatment (<italic>BCL, BLR1, CASP8, CD3E, CD4, CD19, IL7R</italic> and <italic>TGFBR2)</italic> exhibited a negative correlation with the extent of TB disease, strongly suggesting that lower levels of transcripts reflect a greater degree of TB-induced pathology. Whereas only <italic>BLR1</italic> and <italic>FCGR1A</italic> expression levels were associated with treatment outcomes at both 2 and 6 months, all 11 biomarkers measured at baseline showed an individual capacity exceeding 70% to predict the ATT treatment outcome at 6 months. The predictive capacity of single genes did not increase when entering all 11 markers into the leave-10-out cross validation model, suggesting that their level of expression may be driven by similar events.</p><p>This study was nested within a larger study which explored the effect of different micronutrient supplementations on biomarkers of TB host immunity.

It is unclear whether this failure to detect a signal is because any effects from micronutrient supplementation were below the threshold of detection by this study approach, or due to the biomarkers selected being sub-optimal for detecting the effect of micronutrients on host immune responses, or to limited sample size.</p><p>Previous studies have explored changes in transcriptional biomarkers on ATT in adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> but studies in children are limited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Research for predictive markers of treatment response is driven by the few tools available to guide decision-making during the prolonged course of ATT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Notably, the only generally-accepted marker for treatment failure currently is lack of culture conversion at 2 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, in addition to requiring weeks to get a final negative culture result, this parameter is of no use in the 70% pediatric TB cases that are culture negative at diagnosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, thus leaving us with no tools to assess the early response to ATT in children. It is possible that specific host immune factors present during these first 2 months or even before the initiation of treatment, may help predicting treatment outcomes. Identification of such objectively-measured factors could pave the way for tailored individual treatment as well as facilitate the evaluation of the ongoing and planned studies of new treatment regimens in children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The present study is the first to directly assess how a panel of biomarkers associate with established parameters of TB disease extent and treatment outcomes in children.

Treatment success is the key in limiting the emerging epidemic of multi-drug resistant TB, and depends on close monitoring of possible treatment failure or relapse.

Although the <italic>FCGR1A</italic> gene encodes the receptor which mediates the effect of binding of the Fc-region of Ig-G on B-cells, the contribution to the <italic>FCGR1A</italic> level in peripheral blood in the setting of TB is probably mostly due to a high expression on myeloid cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> as previously discussed.

As we did not apply any multiplicity adjustment of p-values there is an increased risk of reporting false positive findings, but this approach was deliberately chosen to reduce the risk that we might overlook any potential associations. Although age adjustments slightly reduced the predictor capacity of the single transcripts and signatures tested, it had minor effect on the associations with TB disease extent and treatment outcome. This is indeed encouraging as immunological diagnostics are well known to be less reliable in young children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and the fact that, diagnostic or monitoring tools requiring age adjustments complicates future clinical application. There is also a possibility that the reported changes, the correlations with the extent of TB disease and the predictive capacities of the identified transcripts discovered here are cohort-specific. Because of these limitations, the results need to be further evaluated and confirmed.

Samples with a concentration &#x0003c;50&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l were concentrated at 45&#x02009;&#x000b0;C using a speed-vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). A positive control (using synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization templates) and a commercial Human Universal Reference RNA were included on each plate. All samples (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;163) were run in duplicate. The amplified PCR products were diluted 1:10 with nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O and added to a mixture of Hi-Di-Formamide with 400HD ROX size standard. The PCR fragments were denatured at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min, cooled on ice and analyzed on a 3730 capillary sequencer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). Data were analyzed using GeneMapper version 4.0 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) with adjustments of the default peak detection settings if required. The peak areas of replicates were averaged, normalized against <italic>GAPDH</italic> and log2 transformed as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Multiplex bead array (bioplex)</title><p>Biomarkers at the translational level (IFN&#x003b1;2, IFN&#x003b3;, IL1&#x003b2;, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL10, IL12p40, IL12p70, IL13, IL17A, IP10, MCP1, MCP3 and TNF&#x003b1;) were analyzed in peripheral WB stimulated with MTB-specific antigens: Early Secretory Antigenic Target-6 (ESAT-6), Culture Filtrate Protein-10 (CFP10) and TB antigen 7.7 (QFT supernatants) and analyzed using the &#x02018;Human cytokines 18-plex&#x02019; kit (Milliplex MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine kit, Merck Millipore, Missouri, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in clinical characteristics between the intervention groups at baseline were assessed by Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, where appropriate.</p><p>Treatment outcome variables were treated as binary outcomes.

Changes in immune biomarkers over time within intervention groups were also assessed by the same models. In addition to the intervention-time interaction with a common baseline level, these models included adjustments for age and gender as fixed effects and for subject-specific differences as random effects. Measurements that fell below the lower detection limit or above the upper detection limit were accommodated in models as left- and right-censored observations, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Models were fitted to base 2 logarithm(log2)-transformed measurements.

Furthermore, values at baseline, at 2 months, and the corresponding change scores were all analyzed while adjusting for micronutrient supplementation by 1) separate logistic regression models to evaluate the possible association with the treatment outcomes at 2 and 6 months, 2) by a leave-10-out cross-validation to evaluate their capacity to predict the treatment outcomes at 2 and 6 months, and finally by jointly entering all transcriptional biomarkers with detectable levels (20 out of 49, excluding the house-keeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic>) into the model without making any a priori assumptions. All analyses were performed with and without adjustment for age at baseline.</p><p>The statistical environment R (R Core Team, 2014) and IBM SPSS version 21 (IBM, Bergen, Norway) were used for the analyses.
