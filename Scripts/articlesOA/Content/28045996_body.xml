<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptomic analysis from tissue samples is now a common approach for in vivo systems level assessments of multicellular biological processes. This has allowed identification of enriched functional pathways using well-established bioinformatic tools [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but deconvoluting the data to decipher the relative cellular composition of tissue samples from transcriptional profiles remains a substantial challenge [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To do so, multiparameter transcriptional gene signatures or modules have been proposed to reflect different cell types, and can be represented by a single summary measurement. This approach reduces noise from individual constituent genes whilst allowing comparative assessments between samples [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Modules have been used successfully to reveal relative enrichment of immune cell types in blood transcriptomic datasets [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as confirming cellular infiltration in tissue inflammation, such as the site of the tuberculin skin test (TST) [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Diverse methods have been used to derive cell-type specific transcriptional modules. These include manually curated lists of genes [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], identification of genes which are differentially expressed between purified cell types [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], semi-supervised approaches that identify genes co-correlated with putative cell markers [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and entirely unsupervised network analyses of purified cell types [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or peripheral blood samples [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consequently, there are now many published modules that share similar cellular annotations [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but may vary in their constituent genes. However, there has been no systematic assessment of the comparative sensitivity and specificity with which they reflect their purported cellular associations. We tested the hypothesis that substantial discordance exists between the performance of different transcriptional modules representing individual immune cell subsets. In order to identify the transcriptional immune cell modules that reflect the cellular composition most accurately, we propose a modular discrimination index (MDI) that ranks the relationship of each module with cell numbers from human blood and tissue specimens and thereby identifies the best performing cell type specific modules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Derivation and comparison of cell-type specific modules</title><p>Numerous immune cell transcriptional modules have been derived by identification of co-correlated expression networks from purified cell types or human peripheral blood transcriptional datasets [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Modules can also be derived from genes differentially expressed between a cell of interest and all other cells within any one transcriptional dataset [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, we derived further modules using two alternative strategies. First, by identifying transcripts with &#x0003e;2-fold increased expression in the cell of interest compared to all other cells common across multiple datasets from purified cells. Second, by using validated cell type specific &#x02018;markers&#x02019; as baits to identify co-correlated genes and assemble modules with the genes that were common to all the co-correlated lists in multiple data sets [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These modules are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169271.s003">S3 Table</xref>.</p><p>A consequence of the multiple strategies to generate cell-type associated transcriptional modules is that a large number of independently derived modules have now been ascribed similar or overlapping annotations. We compared the constituent genes across all of the published cell-associated modules, using the Jaccard index to quantify the proportion of shared genes in all pairwise analyses. Different modules associated with the same cell type broadly revealed a greater degree of sharing, but there was also substantial discordance between modules associated with the same cell, and in some cases, substantial sharing amongst modules associated with different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Given the evident discordance in modules associated with a particular cell type, we tested the hypothesis that different modules would indicate significant variation in the abundance of the target cell within any given multicellular transcriptome. We compared the expression of 26 modules that have been associated with T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169271.s003">S3 Table</xref>) in genome-wide transcriptional data from the site of a tuberculin skin test (TST), representing a classical model of inflammation in which enrichment of T cells is well established [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Most T cell modules showed increased relative expression in data from TST samples compared to that of control saline injections, but there was striking heterogeneity in the relative expression of different modules, some of which showed no significant enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0169271.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0169271.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Variability in cell-type specific module content and expression.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Heat map of Jaccard index for multiple pairwise comparisons between a wide range of cell-type specific transcriptional modules, reflecting the proportion of shared genes.

Although we observed higher module expression in the target cell type, this analysis revealed marked variation in signal intensities for target cells relative to others, reflecting substantial variation in both sensitivity and specificity across the range of purported cell type associated modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0169271.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0169271.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Cell-type specific module expression across multiple cell types.</title><p>Heat map of module geometric mean expression for multiple cell-type specific modules (columns) within genome wide transcriptomes from selected immune blood cells (rows).

In order to address this question, we surmised that modules with the highest MDI score would provide the most sensitive measure of cell-type specific enrichment. Accordingly, we found that the relative expression of each T cell module at the site of TST, compared to saline injection, correlated significantly with the MDI for T cell modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Likewise, a significant correlation was seen between MDI and relative enrichment of T cell modules in data from skin samples in which T cell infiltration was induced by injections of interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. B cell module MDI correlated significantly with differences in B cell module expression between tissue samples from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that showed B cell enrichment compared to healthy lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In erythema nodosum leprosum lesions characterised by neutrophil infiltration that is not evident in lepromatous leprosy lesions [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], enrichment of neutrophils was closely correlated to the MDI score of neutrophil modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). B cell depletion after rituximab treatment [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and NK cell depletion in the uteri of women treated with the progesterone receptor modulator asoprisinil [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were best identified by B and NK cell modules with the greatest MDI scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g004">Fig 4E &#x00026; 4F</xref>). These findings were observed in both Agilent and Affymetrix microarray data, but in order to extend our MDI validation further, we identified RNA-Seq expression data from human head and neck cancer samples where tumour infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) numbers were classified as high or moderate [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The differences in T cell module expression between high and moderate TIL tumours closely correlated with T cell module MDI score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169271.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).

Crucially, the process of predicting the overall cellular association of modules from its constituent genes is often manual and dependent on investigators&#x02019; a priori knowledge, or interpretation of the published literature. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that different modules purported to represent the same cell type vary significantly in their specificity, and consequently provide different estimates for cell type enrichment in tissues.</p><p>We quantified module performance by relating it to module specificity as measured by a meta-analysis of module expression across a large set of purified immune cell transcriptomes. This specificity was then mapped to an ordinal scoring system which we call MDI. We demonstrate that MDI scores accurately predict relative module enrichment in tissues and, where available, predict module expression covariance with cell numbers in both blood and tissue. A strength of this scoring framework is that it provides an independent hierarchy of module accuracy applicable across different tissue settings and across different sources of transcriptional data, including several microarray platforms and RNA sequencing. MDI scores therefore provide a good predictor of module performance in cell type quantification, without requiring extensive in silico or in vitro validation of module performance.</p><p>We focused on generating MDI scores for immune cell modules as changes in cell numbers are common biological questions and many datasets of pure cells were available for scoring purposes. Importantly, we showed that the MDI score correctly ranked the sensitivity and specificity of the cell type specific modules within clinical samples representing a diverse array of pathologies or immunological responses. We interpret this to mean that the best performing modules represent core transcriptional programs independent of differential cellular activation states. Although we and others have described cytokine and innate immune stimulus specific gene expression modules to represent functional biological activity beyond cellular composition [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], comprehensive data from which to derive transcriptional modules representing cell-type specific activation states are not presently available, and may well require multiparametric flow cytometry to resolve accurately. Likewise, transcriptional data to discriminate between closely related cell subsets, such as CD4 and CD8 na&#x000ef;ve or memory T cells are the focus for future work.</p><p>The meta-analysis performed in this study supports the use of transcriptional modules to extract biological information from tissues as well as blood. Modules have been mostly used to describe relative cell and pathway enrichment in whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We previously identified transcriptional modules which could decipher cell and innate immune response enrichment from human skin [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the current manuscript we extend these observations further, demonstrating their applicability across a range of human tissue types. Although some cells undoubtedly induce context specific transcriptional programmes, we demonstrate that cells retain some tissue-agnostic transcriptional profiles, observing that B cell modules with the greatest specificity (i.e. MDI score) accurately reflect B cell numbers in lungs, blood and lymph nodes. Equally, the most specific T cell modules reflect T cell numbers in blood, head and neck tumours, skin and lymph nodes. Notably, we also show for the first time that cell biology in tissues is faithfully reflected by modules derived purely from unsupervised network analysis of whole blood transcriptomes [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The MDI scoring framework also provided insight into the merits of different module generating methodologies. Whilst no single approach consistently provided the best modules, MDI scores highlight that unsupervised network analyses generate highly heterogeneous modules, some possessing no specificity for their annotated cell type. Secondly, where modules are generated in a supervised manner by incorporating genes which show differential expression, limiting a module&#x02019;s constituent genes to those identified in multiple datasets almost always improves performance compared to using analysis of individual datasets. Finally, in settings where dataset availability may be limited or novel cell subtypes are being investigated [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a semi-supervised approach to module generation using genes co-correlated to marker bait genes appears to be a viable alternative approach to generate highly specific modules [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we have generated and validated in multiple settings a novel, cross-platform framework for ranking the quality of published transcriptional modules. We propose that the MDI scoring approach becomes a new standard to assess the fidelity of modules&#x02019; annotations in order to make accurate comparative assessments in transcriptional analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Datasets</title><p>All datasets used are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169271.s001">S1 Table</xref>.

Where a dataset specified the differentiation or activation state of a target cell, these conditions were averaged prior to MDI scoring, in order to focus on modules&#x02019; core performance to reflect a particular cell type (e.g. gene expression of resting and activated T cells was averaged when generating MDI scores for T cells overall). All other comparator conditions in that dataset were unaltered for MDI score generation.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Skin biopsy collection and transcriptomic analysis</title><p>Skin biopsy samples were collected as part of a research study approved by UK National Research Ethics Service (reference no: 11/LO/1863).

At 72 hours, skin biopsies for transcriptomic and histological analysis were collected and stored as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0169271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Frozen sections were carefully thawed and fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin, then embedded in paraffin wax (Sakura). 10 &#x003bc;m sections were cut and stained using the Leica Bond III automated immunostaining platform, with the Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection kit (Leica DS9800and a DAB chromogen. More specifically, anti-human antibodies against CD3 (clone LN10) (Leica NCL-L-CD3-565) were used. Whole slide images of the histology sections were acquired with an Axio-Scan microscope using Zen 2 core software at 20x magnification and are presented without any subsequent processing. Digital image analysis was performed using Definiens AG (Munich) Tissue Studio 4.3. Tissue detection automatically identified all the tissue within each image, then a machine learning method was used to separate the sample from background and non-tissue regions, and segment the sample into dermis and epidermis; manual correction was used to ensure valid separation of these regions of interest (ROI). A fixed threshold was then applied to each ROI to identify the chromogen positive areas (&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>), which is represented as a percentage of the total tissue/ROI area.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Spearman Rank correlations and linear regression models were calculated in Graphpad Prism, and covariance analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169271.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Table of accession numbers for all microarray data used in this manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169271.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169271.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Table of R functions utilised for all data analyses in this manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169271.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169271.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Module names, descriptions, source and contents.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169271.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169271.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Table of immune cell module MDI scores.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169271.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec>
