<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Successful defense against pathogens requires both, the eradication of the infectious agent by the immune system as well as tissue protection against the damaging effects of the immune response. Increasing evidence indicates that many if not most infectious diseases result from insufficient resilience, i.e., from a failure of the infected host to repair and regenerate destroyed tissues, rather than from inefficient pathogen clearance (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Mechanisms which preserve the integrity of host tissues during the intensive inflammatory response against the pathogen remain incompletely understood. Recent studies established that successful tissue protection during infection requires systems which balance the immune response as well as mechanisms which restore tissue homeostasis. These mechanisms are often interdependent and result from messengers like growth factors, cytokines, or lipids produced by immune cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Examples include the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, the tissue regeneration promoting IL-22 and amphiregulin, the tissue remodeler TGF-&#x003b2;, or the pro-resolving lipid lipoxin (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Remarkably, several recent studies demonstrated that type I interferons (IFNs) can also act as critical resilience-promoting cytokines during infections with several streptococcal species (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Such protective functions are in marked contrast to detrimental effects of type I IFN during infections with many other bacterial species (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The reasons for the ambivalent roles of type I IFNs in bacterial infections remain poorly understood. However, it appears that the ability of type I IFNs to both suppress and stimulate immune responses is of critical importance (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This review focuses on the role of type I IFNs in balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory processes as well as cell survival and cell death programs during antibacterial defense and discusses how these effects determine the outcome of an infection.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of type I interferons (IFN) signaling in bacterial infections</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pathogen</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of bacteria</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Route of infection</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model of infection</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effect of type I IFN signaling</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mechanism</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gram+, extracell</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intranasal;

It is now known that type I IFNs are cytokines produced in response to viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, as well as parasites. The effector mechanisms of type I IFNs mainly derive from products of genes which are transcriptionally regulated by type I IFN signaling. Type I IFNs induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through activation of the homodimeric STAT1 and the heterotrimeric STAT1&#x02013;STAT2&#x02013;IRF9 (i.e., ISGF3) transcription factors (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Bacteria trigger type I IFN production mostly following the recognition of bacterial nucleic acids or the Gram-negative cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by innate immune receptors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The induction mechanisms have been best studied for IFN-&#x003b2; which belongs together with IFN&#x003b1;4 to the first type I IFNs produced during infection and is the driver of other type I IFN genes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The induction of IFN-&#x003b2; by bacterial DNA is complex and involves different pathways. The most common mode of IFN-&#x003b2; induction by bacterial DNA is through the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, as described for <italic>Francisella novicida</italic>, group B streptococcus (GBS) (<italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>), <italic>Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The cytosolic DNA sensor Ifi204 (IFI16 in humans) contributes to IFN-&#x003b2; induction in the course of <italic>F. novicida</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The signaling events downstream of these DNA sensors involve the STING&#x02013;TBK1&#x02013;IRF3 pathway driving the IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcription. <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can activate this pathway also independently of DNA sensing. This alternative mechanism is driven by binding of the bacterial product c-di-AMP to STING (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The recognition of bacterial DNA through unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA by the endosomal Toll-like receptor 9 can also contribute to IFN-&#x003b2; induction, although the importance and relevance of this pathway in the context of the overall IFN-&#x003b2; production and host response have not been entirely clarified (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Bacterial RNA has been recently established as another key IFN-&#x003b2; inducer. A short and highly conserved sequence found in the bacterial 23S rRNA is recognized by the mouse TLR13 leading to Myd88- and IRF5-dependent IFN-&#x003b2; induction (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Human cells employ TLR8 as IFN-&#x003b2;-inducing RNA sensor rather than TLR13 which is missing in humans (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The precise nature of bacterial RNA triggering the human TLR8 remains to be identified.</p><p>IFN-&#x003b2; induction by LPS occurs after binding of this ligand to the TLR4 and the following internalization into the endosome (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Subsequently, a TRIF-dependent activation of the kinase TBK1 causes phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3 to stimulate IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcription. Endosomal signaling has been also implicated in IFN-&#x003b2; induction by TLR2 in response to Gram-positive bacteria, although this mechanism appears to be restricted to specific immune cells and/or pathogens (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The cytosolic receptors NOD1 and NOD2 were reported to trigger IFN-&#x003b2; production following infection with <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>).

One of the rare studies on this topic revealed that the dominant IFN-&#x003b2;-inducing pathway during infection with <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (group A streptococcus) is the TLR13-mediated RNA recognition pathway (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Additional work is also needed to clarify the key IFN-&#x003b2; producing cells, as investigated during, e.g., <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infections (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and the reported cell type-specific features of IFN-&#x003b2; induction (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Tipping the Balance I: Benefits of Immunomodulatory Effects of Type I IFN Signaling During Bacterial Infections</title><p>Type I IFNs&#x02019; ability to stimulate immune responses against viruses has been established very early after their discovery but it soon became clear that these cytokines exhibit also immunosuppressive activities. The first evidence for such immunosuppressive activities was provided in a study showing that type I IFNs were able to reduce carrageenin-induced footpad swelling (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Thus, type I IFNs are now regarded as immunomodulatory cytokines capable of enhancing or dampening the immune response, depending on the context. This ambiguousness contributes to the disparate and still incompletely understood roles of type I IFNs during bacterial infections. Importantly, no unifying principles have been found to date: neither the beneficial nor detrimental effects of type I IFN signaling correlate with the broad pathogen classification into Gram-positive and -negative, extra- and intracellular pathogens, or the route of infection (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Immunosuppressive effects of type I IFN signaling are beneficial during infection with the Gram-positive largely extracellular human pathogen <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> is the causative agent of mild (e.g., pharyngitis and scarlet fever) but also invasive and life-threatening infections (e.g., cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome). Mice deficient in the type I IFN receptor IFNAR1 are more susceptible to subcutaneous <italic>S.&#x02009;pyogenes</italic> infection, which is a relevant model of severe invasive infection of the soft tissue (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Type I IFN signaling promotes resistance against <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> by suppressing the transcription of the <italic>Il1b</italic> gene (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The absence of type I IFN signaling results in an unrestricted production of IL-1&#x003b2; thereby causing a lethal hyperinflammation and organ damage. Importantly, type I IFN signaling balances rather than prevents <italic>Il1b</italic> transcription so that a controlled and life-saving IL-1&#x003b2; production is achieved (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The key IFN-&#x003b2; producer and effector cells in this infection model are both LysM+ and CD11c+ myeloid cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Immunomodulation by type I IFN signaling is protective during infection with the human Gram-positive extracellular pathogen GBS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). GBS is regarded as commensal microbe asymptomatically colonizing the skin and mucosal tissues of 30% people, yet it is the leading cause of severe neonatal pneumonia and meningitis in developed countries. The absence of IFNAR1 results in increased bacterial loads during both subcutaneous GBS infection of neonate mice and intravenous infection of adult animals (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Similarly, type I IFN signaling is protective against uncontrolled bacteremia during infection with the Gram-negative intracellular bacterium <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, which is a frequent cause of the severe pneumonia, Legionnaire&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

The organismal physiology of the protective effects of type I IFN signaling during infection with GBS and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> remains to be elucidated so that it is presently unclear whether immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory effects of type I IFNs drive the resistance against these two pathogens.</p><p>Stimulation of the immune response by type I IFN signaling is advantageous in defense against the Gram-negative pathogen <italic>H.&#x02009;pylori</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> is a frequent cause of chronic gastritis and is associated with increased risk of gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Deficiency in type I IFN signaling causes increased <italic>H.&#x02009;pylori</italic> loads in the stomach of orally infected mice. The lack of type I IFN responses is associated with decreased levels of the chemokine CXCL10 suggesting that type I IFNs promote defense against <italic>H. pylori</italic> by stimulating CXCL10-driven inflammation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Immunostimulatory effects of type I IFNs are beneficial also during gastric infection with the food-borne Gram-positive intracellular pathogen <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infects the gastrointestinal tract, where it traverses the epithelial barrier and spreads into distant organs. Deficiency in type I IFN signaling results in an increased bacterial dissemination and is accompanied by diminished production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-6 upon gastric infection using oral gavage (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Interestingly, type I IFN signaling plays no role in an infection model using food contaminated with <italic>L.&#x02009;monocytogenes</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Tipping the Balance II: Disadvantages of Immunomodulatory Effects of Type I IFN Signaling During Bacterial Infections</title><p>Immunosuppression by type I IFN signaling is detrimental during infection with the intracellular pathogen and causative agent of tuberculosis, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Type I IFN signaling-mediated inhibition of IL-1 cytokines during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lung infection blunts the antimicrobial defense and results in increased local as well as systemic bacterial loads (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The key type I IFN effector cells are transplantable inflammatory monocyte-macrophage cells and DCs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The precise mechanism of IL-1 inhibition by type I IFN signaling in this infection model is not resolved but includes both direct as well as indirect mechanisms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The indirect IL-1 inhibition appears to be mediated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 which is known to be upregulated by type I IFNs (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The importance of type I IFN signaling in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections is underlined by type I IFN signaling-associated gene expression pattern found in blood cells of patients with active tuberculosis (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The detrimental function of type I IFN signaling during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lung infection is converted into a protective one if IFN-&#x003b3; signaling is missing (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Under such conditions, type I IFNs inhibit the polarization of macrophages into infection-permissive alternatively activated macrophages.</p><p>Inhibition of immune response by type I IFNs is deleterious during infection with the facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacterium <italic>F. novicida</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). <italic>F. novicida</italic> is a subspecies of <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> which infects humans through the skin or aerosol droplets and causes ulceroglandular or pneumonic tularemia, respectively. IFNAR1-deficient mice infected intradermally with <italic>F. novicida</italic> respond by an increased IL-17 production compared to WT animals and, correspondingly, are more resistant against infection (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Similar increase in resistance is also observed during lung infection with <italic>F. tularensis</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The key IL-17 producers during <italic>F. novicida</italic> infection are IL-17A+ &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells which show enhanced expansion in the absence of type I IFN signaling.</p><p>Interferon-&#x003b2; exacerbates infection with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> by reducing the ability of the host to launch a complete immune response (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> is Gram-negative intracellular pathogen associated with gastroenteritis in humans and a severe disease resembling typhoid fever in mice. Mice deficient in IFN-&#x003b2; are more resistant against oral infection with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and display enhanced expression of IL-1&#x003b2; and the neutrophil chemoattractants, CXCL1 and CXCL2 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

The suppression of the IFN-&#x003b3; signaling results in an increased susceptibility to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection. Increased susceptibility to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection is also caused by type I IFN-mediated induction of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>).</p><p>Immunosuppressive effects of type I IFNs are harmful during postinfluenzal bacterial pneumonia (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The immune response during a secondary postinfluenzal infection with the Gram-positive extracellular pathogen <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, a key causative agent of pneumonia, is impaired. This is caused by the ability of type I IFNs to suppress production of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL2, the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2, and the inflammation-promoting cytokine IL-17 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The resulting reduction of leukocyte infiltration in the lung diminishes the capability of the host to control bacterial growth. Similar alterations in the immune response appear to be responsible for the increased susceptibility of mice to postinfluenzal infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive effects of type I IFN signaling during postinfluenzal bacterial infection are not well understood but they might act downstream of the type I IFN-mediated inhibition of IL-1 cytokines.</p><p>Enhancement of the inflammatory response is associated with detrimental effects of type I IFN signaling during lung infection with the Gram-positive extracellular pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

The pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains correlates with the levels of type I IFNs induced during infection with differently virulent strains (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Tipping the Balance III: Regulation of Tissue and Cell Integrity by Type I IFNs During Bacterial Infections</title><p>Type I IFN signaling plays an indispensable role in the preservation of the epithelial barrier and epithelial integrity during lung infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Type I IFN signaling promotes the maintenance of lung epithelial tight junctions during <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection thereby reducing the passage of the pathogen from alveoli into the lung parenchyma (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). IFNAR1-deficient mice display increased permeability of the lung epithelium and enhanced invasiveness of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection associated with higher bacterial burden in distant organs.

The complex and often disparate effects of type I IFNs on the outcome of different bacterial infections provide chances to exploit type I IFNs and their inducers as well as effectors for adjuvant therapies tailored to specific infectious diseases. A prerequisite for the development of such therapies is a detailed understanding of the molecular, cellular, and organismal physiology of type IFNs in the course of bacterial infections. The following topics appear particularly important since they represent rather underexplored yet critically important areas.</p><sec id="S6-1"><title>Pathogen Species</title><p>The inconsistent roles of type I IFNs during infections with different bacteria remain a significant and challenging topic in the current research. Only few common principles of type I IFN action have been found to date. They include the cell death-promoting effects of type I IFNs which contribute mostly to detrimental functions of type I IFN signaling. Another frequent observation is the suppression of IL-1&#x003b2; and neutrophil chemoattractants&#x02014;these effects are, however, associated with both beneficial and harmful consequences for the infection outcome. Future studies employing pathogens which have not yet been analyzed in detail, such as <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, or <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, might reveal novel common principles.</p></sec><sec id="S6-2"><title>Infection Route and Tissue-Specific Features of Type I IFN Signaling</title><p>The complexity of type I IFN function in bacterial infections is further increased by the distinct effects of type I IFNs in response to the same but differently administered pathogen. Type I IFNs are harmful followed intraperitoneal or intravenous infection with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> but protective in a physiologically more relevant intragastric infection (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In contrast, type I IFN signaling has no impact on the overall outcome of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection after ingesting pathogen-contaminated food (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These observations suggest that type I IFN signaling has, with regard to bacterial infections, distinct functions in different tissues/organs. This implication is supported by a recent study showing that exogenous type I IFN has, depending on the site of administration, disparate effects on the course of lung infection with <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Infections with <italic>C. burnetii</italic>, a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium, in humans occur after inhalation of bacteria and result in Q fever which can develop into an atypical pneumonia. Lung infection with <italic>C. burnetii</italic> in mice has a more severe course in WT compared to IFNAR1-deficient animals indicating that type I IFN signaling is disadvantageous in this infection model (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Consistently, intraperitoneally administered type I IFN exacerbates <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection. However, intratracheal delivery of type I IFN ameliorates the course of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection. The mechanisms of these distinct effects of type I IFN signaling in different tissues remain to be elucidated. Future studies should investigate other pathogens known of using various routes of infection and focus on physiologically most relevant routes.</p></sec><sec id="S6-3"><title>Most Significant Type I IFN Inducers and Effectors</title><p>Modulation of type I IFN production during bacterial infection might represent a powerful approach in therapy of infectious diseases. Therapeutic targeting of type I IFN production requires the knowledge of the most important type I IFN-inducing pathway in a given infection. As most bacterial pathogens employ more than one pathway to stimulate type I IFN production, future efforts should focus on the identification of the most crucial bacterial and cellular components involved in type I IFN induction. These studies will need to use a combination of bacterial and animal host genetics for functional assessment and suitable reporter as well as imaging systems for type I IFN detection <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the effector side, recent studies provided a number of novel type I IFN-induced factors which interfere with pathogen replication and survival. Notably, various type I IFN-inducible small GTP-binding proteins have recently been showed to significantly contribute to the effects of type I IFNs [e.g., Ref.
