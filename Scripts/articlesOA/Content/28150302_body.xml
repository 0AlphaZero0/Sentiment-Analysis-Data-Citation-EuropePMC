Large insertions and deletions within the genome, referred to as large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs), were initially used to characterize the evolution and phylogeography of the MTBC <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. The association of lineages with specific host populations led to a nomenclature for MTBC lineages which mirrors geographic regions where lineages predominate <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> (Fig. <xref rid="eji3852-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). MTBC phylogenies subsequently constructed using whole genome sequence (WGS) data were congruent with those generated using LSPs <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, and are used in this review. Human&#x02010;adapted MTBC strains are grouped into seven lineages classified as &#x0201c;ancient&#x0201d; (lineages 1, 5, 6, and 7) or &#x0201c;modern&#x0201d; (2, 3, and 4) according to the presence or absence of the tuberculosis&#x02010;specific deletion (TbD1) region (Fig. <xref rid="eji3852-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). While modern MTBC lineages (i.e. lineage 2 and 4) have spread globally, most ancient lineages (i.e. lineage 5 and 6 (West Africa) and lineage 7 (Ethiopia)) remain geographically restricted to specific regions/countries where they cause disease <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>.

When genotyping techniques became available in the 1990s, outbreaks caused by specific MTBC strains could be delineated and these strains have been characterized in a range of models <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Two of the most highly chacterized outbreak strains are Mtb CDC1551and HN878. The CDC1551 strain, a member of lineage 4, was responsible for a TB outbreak, that exhibited an unusually high rate of tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion in contacts <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Subsequently it was shown that CDC1551 induced high levels of IL&#x02010;12 and IFN&#x02010;&#x003b3; in mice, which may explain the observation of high levels of TST conversion <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. The HN878 Mtb, a lineage 2 strain, was implicated in multiple outbreaks in Houston, Texas, USA, and was shown to be highly virulent in mice <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> and rabbits <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>.

In addition to transmission, associations between specific MTBC lineages and the site of disease <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, clinical presentation, and the duration of disease <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> have been observed.</p><p>Evidence of significant differences in the transmission and manifestations of disease of MTBC lineages worldwide (reviewed in <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>), and variable evidence for host genetic polymorphism and susceptibility to MTBC <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, suggests that genetic variation within the MTBC may influence the host&#x02013;pathogen interaction and outcome of the infection. In this review, we specifically consider the immunological consequences of MTBC lineage diversity on the innate and adaptive response and discuss the potential translational implications of differences in the immunological response to different MTBC strains.</p></sec><sec id="eji3852-sec-0020"><title>The impact of MTBC lineage diversity on the interaction with innate immune cell receptors</title><p>Innate immune cell receptors are the first point of contact with MTBC bacilli, and thus play an important role in downstream immune response to MTBC. A wide range of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are involved in the initial interaction between MTBC and host cells, including toll like receptors (TLRs), C&#x02010;type lectin receptors (CLRs), nod like receptors (NLRs) and scavenger proteins <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. The cell wall structure of MTBC is complex, including glycolipids and lipoproteins that are uniquely found in pathogenic mycobacterial species and can vary between lineages <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>. Together with secreted effector proteins, cell wall components act as pathogen&#x02010;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by host immune cells. Subtle differences in cell wall components can impact the immune response <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> and in addition to activating the immune response, many cell wall components have immunomodulatory functions, which can modulate the immune response in favor of the bacterium <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. In the following sections we highlight experimental evidence that demonstrates variation in PAMPs between MTBC lineages that may influence interaction with PRRs.</p><sec id="eji3852-sec-0030"><title>C&#x02010;type lectins</title><p>C&#x02010;type lectins are one important class of receptor that function in innate immunity to TB. Alveolar macrophages highly express Mannose&#x02010;receptor (MR, CD206), while dendritic cell specific intercellular&#x02010;adhesion&#x02010;molecule&#x02010;3 grabbing non&#x02010;integrin (DC&#x02010;SIGN, CD209) is mostly highly expressed on dendritic cells (DC) <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. MTBC cell wall products such as lipoarabinomanan (LAM) and mannosylated&#x02010;lipoarabinomanan (Man&#x02010;LAM) <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> are recognized by these receptors. Phagocytosis of MTBC via this pathway leads to a reduced inflammatory response thereby presenting an important route of entry from the perspective of the bacillus <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. Structural variation in LAM between virulent and attenuated Mtb laboratory strains results in lower macrophage uptake in vitro of the attenuated Mtb H37Ra strain when compared with more virulent H37Rv or Erdman strains <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. Similar differences have been reported amongst clinical MTBC. A set of lineage 2 isolates were identified as being deficient in uptake by human monocyte&#x02010;derived&#x02010;macrophages (MDMs) in vitro when compared with the Erdman Mtb strain (a lineage 4 strain) <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. While links with diversity in lipid metabolizing genes were not uncovered, biochemical characterization revealed that ManLAMs in these strains where truncated and more highly branched, leading to reduced surface exposure and thus decreased engagement with the MR <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="eji3852-sec-0040"><title>Toll&#x02010;like receptors (TLRS)</title><p>Toll&#x02010;like receptors (TLRs) are another set of PRRs that are important for sensing MTBC infection <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. Differential recognition of MTBC lineages may impact the response of phagocytes and cytokine production <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. Lipid and protein antigens from MTBC can be recognized by TLR4 and human polymorphism in TLR9 is associated with TB susceptibility; however, due its affinity for lipids, TLR2 is thought to be the dominant TLR for recognition of MTBC <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. Lipid fractions from a lineage 2 isolate, the H37Rv laboratory strain, and <italic>M. canettii</italic> have also been shown to differentially affect TLR2 and TLR4 expression on macrophages. Human MDMs produced higher levels of TNF&#x02010;&#x003b1; and IL&#x02010;10, and expressed lower levels of TLR2 and TLR4 when stimulated with lipid fractions from a lineage 2 strain when compared with H37Rv and <italic>M. canettii</italic>
<xref rid="eji3852-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. In a subsequent study characterizing the ability of lineage 2 strains to activate TLR2 and TLR4 receptors in mice, Carmona et&#x000a0;al. (2013) show that for most strains studied, cytokine production by macrophages was induced via TLR2 activation <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. However, a specific lineage 2 strain activated the TLR4 receptor on bone marrow&#x02010;derived macrophages, leading to production of IFN&#x02010;&#x003b2;, increased bacterial burden and lung pathology during the early stages of mouse infection <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. A study in mice demonstrated that the lineage 2 HN878 Mtb strain induced lower levels of mRNA for Th1 cytokines, TNF&#x02010;&#x003b1;, IL&#x02010;6, IL&#x02010;12, and IFN&#x02010;&#x003b3;, and higher levels for mRNA encoding type 1 IFNs, potentially explaining the increased virulence of this strain in mice <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. While this study did not directly address the role of TLRs, preferential activation of TLR4 may partially explain this phenotype. However, Carmona <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2013) also demonstrated that activation of TLR4 was not specific to lineage 2 strains, with the Mtb Haarlem sub lineage strain, a member of lineage 4, also able to activate TLR4 with concomittant production of IFN&#x02010;&#x003b2; <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. In addition, the production of IL&#x02010;17 via a TLR2&#x02010;dependent pathway was shown to be protective for mice infected with HN878 but not H37Rv <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>.

A recent reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Mtb lineage 2 strains, by genetic characterization of more than one thousand isolates, suggests that BCG vaccination had minimal impact on the population size of lineage 2, suggesting vaccination was insufficient to prevent lineage 2 dissemination <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. To determine whether this is specific to the lineage 2 genotype or due to general variability in BCG efficacy would require similar characterization of MTBC lineages. Data from BALB/c mice and a rabbit model suggest that BCG vaccination provides lower levels of protection against challenge with lineage 2 isolates <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref>; however, these findings were not reproduced in C57BL/6 mice <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref>. A subsequent study conducted in C57BL/6 mice and guinea pigs suggested that BCG conferred acceptable levels of protection to lineage 2 strains isolated in South Africa, but not against those isolated in the USA <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">81</xref>. The authors suggest that variable BCG protection is a function of strain fitness, rather than lineage diversity; however, in all of these studies only a few isolates of lineage 2 strain were investigated <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">81</xref>.</p><p>In terms of new vaccines, the recombinant BCG candidate (VPM1002) expressing listeriolysin but defective in urease production, was shown to confer better protection than standard BCG in BALB/c mice, hypothesized as a result of increased antigen translocation into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages and resultant antigen cross&#x02010;priming <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref>. Moreover, this vaccine conferred a similar level of protection against a lineage 2 strain as H37Rv <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref>. VPM1002 is currently in Phase II trials as a BCG replacement candidate vaccine in HIV&#x02010;infected infants, and is proposed for Phase III efficacy trials <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">83</xref>.</p><p>As previously discussed, several comparative genomics studies have shown that in MTBC, unlike other bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, T cell epitopes are evolutionarily conserved <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">75</xref>. While the biological consequences are not completely understood, these findings imply that these epitopes are conserved because they fulfill an important biological role, and that immune recognition of MTBC may favor the pathogen <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">84</xref>. One of the proteins in a polypeptide candidate TB vaccine, M72/AS0E1, which recently yielded acceptable safety results in a phase II trial <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">85</xref>, contains a sequence from a PE protein discussed in previous sections.

The TST has traditionally been used detect latent TB infection (LTBI). The test, which requires subcutaneous injection of purified protein derivative (PPD) cannot differentiate MTBC infection from BCG vaccination or exposure to environmental non&#x02010;tuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs), and thus may yield false positive results <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref>. IFN&#x02010;&#x003b3; release assays (IGRA) are a set of newer generation tests that measure in vitro IFN&#x02010;&#x003b3; production in whole blood or PBMC in response to MTBC antigen stimulation, such as CFP10 and ESAT&#x02010;6 (and p38&#x02010;55 of Rv2654c) <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">89</xref>. Although IGRA are still unable to discriminate active from latent infection, the absence of the CFP10 and ESAT&#x02010;6 in BCG and most NTMs confers on IGRA increased specificity to detect MTBC sensitization <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">89</xref>. However, the attenuated T cell response to ESAT&#x02010;6 stimulation in <italic>M. africanum</italic> infected individuals has been shown to affect the interpretation of IGRA results <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">90</xref>. In addition, a number of studies have reported that activated T cell markers <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">91</xref> and soluble cytokines <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">92</xref> can be used as reliable biomarker for monitoring the anti&#x02010;TB treatment response. It has been shown that the production of 27 proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines in response to ESAT&#x02010;6/CFP&#x02010;10 stimulation was not significantly different between <italic>M. africanum</italic> and Mtb&#x02010;infected patients pre&#x02010;treatment. However, the kinetics of production of these cytokines following treatment was significantly different between the two groups, with IFN&#x02010;&#x003b3; and GM&#x02010;CSF significantly higher in Mtb compared with <italic>M. africanum</italic> infected patients post&#x02010;treatment <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">93</xref>. These studies reveal that the interpretation of cytokine production&#x02010;based diagnostic tests for monitoring anti&#x02010;TB treatment response may need to account for MTBC lineage variation in West Africa where <italic>M. africanum</italic> is prevalent.</p></sec><sec id="eji3852-sec-0160"><title>The influence of MTBC lineage diversity on novel host&#x02010;directed therapies</title><p>MTBC lineage diversity may also constitute an important factor to consider in the development of host&#x02010;directed therapies (HDT). Some HDT aim to augment the host defense against TB by modulating host pathways involved in the elimination of MTBC <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">94</xref>. Due to both host and MTBC genetic variation, the efficacy of an HDT targeting a specific pathway might differ in specific populations. For example, a combination of zileuton and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as an HDT, which abrogates the detrimental type 1 interferon response and boosts eicosanoid levels, may find utility in TB therapy <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">95</xref>.

It has been observed that TB is not transmitted efficiently from HIV&#x02010;1 co&#x02010;infected individuals, thus transmission predominantly occurs from HIV&#x02010;1 uninfected individuals to HIV&#x02010;1 co&#x02010;infected individuals <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">98</xref>, <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">99</xref>.

Activation of nuclear factor (NF)&#x02010;&#x003ba;&#x003b2; pathway and positive transcription elongation factor (P&#x02010;TEF&#x003b2;), loss of CCAAT/enhancer&#x02010;binding protein and other chemokine and cytokine dependent pathways underlie this phenomenon <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. Clinical isolates of MTBC have been shown to differentially affect the replication of HIV&#x02010;1 in PBMC <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref>. For example, the lineage 4 CDC1551 strain induced higher levels of viral replication in human PBMCs than the lineage 2 HN878 strain <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref>. The HN878 strain contains an intact <italic>pks1&#x02010;15</italic> gene cluster resulting in production of a virulence associated phenolic glycolipid <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. Viral replication in PBMC co&#x02010;infected with a mutant HN878 <italic>pks1&#x02010;15</italic> deletion strain, which no longer produces the phenolic glycolipid, was similar to levels observed in PBMC co&#x02010;infected with the CDC1551 strain. This suggests that strain specific effects on HIV&#x02010;1 replication are associated with cell wall components of MTBC <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref>. MTBC dependent enhancement of HIV&#x02010;1 replication was subsequently shown to be a result of direct binding of transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) to the HIV&#x02010;1 LTR promoter <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">102</xref>.

While the authors did not examine the influence impact of MTBC strain variation in this study <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">102</xref>, the discussion above highlights the differential effects MTBC might have on TLRs.

Moreover, as previously discussed, almost all MTBC WGS data have thus far been generated via short read sequencing techniques. Sequence in highly repetitive regions cannot reliably be determined using these techniques and are usually removed from downstream analysis <xref rid="eji3852-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">72</xref>. Short read data are also not useful for detecting genomic changes such as deletions and duplications, particularly those that span larger regions of the genome.
