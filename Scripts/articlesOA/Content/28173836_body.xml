<sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Despite treatment, central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) often results in severe neurological deficit and frequent death. Dexamethasone, a recommended adjunct to CNS-TB treatment, improves mortality but does not affect long-term neurological outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This has been attributed to innate host factors such as the LTA<sub>4</sub> genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], underscoring the role of host-driven immunopathology in this devastating infection. Newer interventions for CNS-TB are urgently needed to improve both morbidity and mortality, particularly in the era of rising drug resistance. Host-directed therapies may be an attractive therapeutic strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Neutrophils are emerging mediators of TB pathology. These early sentinels to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection play the key roles in TB inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Raised neutrophils are present in CNS-TB in the setting of both HIV-negative and HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and increased neutrophil-associated mediators such as S100A calcium-binding protein correspond to the degree of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which neutrophils cause neuroinflammation in CNS-TB are not defined.</p><p>The development of severe neurological deficits may be caused by local CNS tissue destruction. Tissue damage may be driven by the host immune cells recruited to the CNS such as neutrophils and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], following disruption to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These cells secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), zinc-containing proteases which degrade extracellular matrix fibrils crucial for the integrity of the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. MMPs are inhibited by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). We and others found increased MMP expression in CNS-TB and raised MMP concentrations were associated with neurological deficit and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

As humans are the primary host of <italic>M.tb</italic>, we examined the brain biopsies of patients with proven CNS-TB and investigated our findings in a human cellular model. Neutrophils expressing MMP-9 are present in CNS tuberculous granulomas, and <italic>M.tb</italic> infection increased neutrophil MMP-9 secretion and gene expression. Neutrophil-derived MMP-9 was functionally active and caused type IV collagen destruction, which was reversed by neutralizing MMP-9. We demonstrate that mitogen activated protein-kinase (MAP-kinase) and the phosphoinositide-3 (PI<sub>3</sub>) kinase-Akt pathways regulated neutrophil MMP-9 secretion in monocyte-dependent intercellular networks. Neutralizing TNF&#x003b1; suppressed neutrophil MMP-9 to baseline, while dexamethasone did not, which may partly explain the limited benefit of steroids in patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that host-directed therapy targeting MMP-9 secretion may have a potential to limit immunopathology in CNS-TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Dexamethasone was from Sigma.

We evaluated if NF-kB regulated neutrophil MMP-9 secretion by using NF-kB p65 subunit inhibitor helenalin (IC<sub>50</sub> 10&#x02013;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and IKK<sub>2</sub> inhibitor SC-514 (IC<sub>50</sub> 3&#x02013;12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). In the presence of CoMTB stimulation, we demonstrated a dose-dependent suppression of neutrophil MMP-9 to baseline with helenalin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

We investigated the effect of TNF&#x003b1; neutralizing antibodies on neutrophil MMP secretion. Pre-incubating CoMTB with anti-TNF&#x003b1; prior to stimulating human neutrophils resulted in suppression of MMP-9 secretion and gene expression which was maximal at a dose of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, respectively). TIMP-1 secretion was unaffected by anti-TNF&#x003b1; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) while TIMP-2 secretion was slightly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Dexamethasone is an established adjunct treatment for patients with CNS-TB that improves mortality but does not significantly affecting neurological outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], so we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on neutrophil MMP secretion. MMP-9 secretion was unaffected by dexamethasone at a dose of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, similar to the dose used in clinical trials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>CNS-TB is a devastating infection driven by an excessive host immune response to infection and results in neurological morbidity and death. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which neutrophils contribute to tissue destruction in the brain, further supporting the role of the granulocyte in CNS-TB pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We have demonstrated that neutrophils within granulomas express MMP-9 in the brain biopsies from patients with proven CNS-TB, further highlighting the role of MMPs in pathology of TB granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Neutrophils secrete MMP-9 in response to both direct <italic>M.tb</italic> infection and monocyte-dependent networks in CNS-TB. The combination of the two stimuli has an additive effect to MMP-9 secretion, which is partially driven by TNF&#x003b1;, as demonstrated by a decrease in MMP-9 with the addition of neutralizing anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibodies in CoMTB stimulation. The secretion of MMP-9 from neutrophils results in the destruction of type IV collagen, a major constituent of the basement membrane in the BBB, and this was inhibited by neutralizing MMP-9. This observation may explain why increased MMP-9 expression in CNS diseases corresponds to BBB disruption and is associated with neurological deficit and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There are several potential targets in the MMP-9 regulatory pathway for host-directed therapy in CNS-TB, and of note, both specific and broad-based MMP-inhibitors are currently being explored as adjunctive therapy in other CNS-diseases such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>We explored potential intracellular switch points in the regulation of neutrophil MMP-9 secretion and showed that the MAP-kinase, Akt-PI<sub>3</sub> kinase, and NF-kB have the key roles. This is consistent with our findings of MMP regulation in other CNS cells such as astrocytes and microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, we observed divergent effects with <italic>M.tb</italic> and CoMTB stimulation on neutrophil intracellular signaling pathways. In the presence of virulent <italic>M.tb</italic>, neutrophil MMP-9 secretion was not suppressed by targeted chemical inhibitors of intracellular signaling paths upstream of transcription. In contrast, CoMTB, which contains cytokines including TNF&#x003b1;, results in neutophil MMP-9 secretion and this secretion was decreased by blockade of the p38 and ERK MAP kinases and PI3 kinase paths. This was in contrast to previous findings that TNF&#x003b1;-induced neutrophil MMP-9 secretion is independent of the p38 and ERK kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We postulate the differences caused by CoMTB and <italic>M.tb</italic> may in part be due to <italic>M.tb</italic> triggering cellular necrosis in neutrophils that we and others demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], leading to unregulated release of their proteases, and consequently, pathway modulation did not affect total MMP-9 release. This highlights the importance of monocytes in mediating neutrophil secretion of MMP-9 that drives matrix destruction in TB.</p><p>NF-kB inhibition decreased neutrophil MMP-9 secretion in response to both direct infection and monocyte-dependent networks. We have previously demonstrated that NF-kB inhibition decreased neutrophil MMP-8 secretion which drove type I collagen degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], a fibril which is important in lung TB but minimally present in the central nervous system. We now demonstrate that neutrophil MMP-9, which drives destruction of type IV collagen present in the BBB, is suppressed by NF-kB inhibition. Thalidomide inhibits NF-kB by suppressing IkB kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and has been used to treat paradoxical reaction in CNS-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but its considerable side effects such as teratogenicity and peripheral neuropathy mean that its potential as use for a host-directed therapy will be very limited.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the effects of anti-TNF&#x003b1; and dexamethasone on neutrophil MMP-9 secretion and found that anti-TNF&#x003b1; treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil MMP-9 secretion, while dexamethasone partially inhibited MMP-8 but did not affect MMP-9 secretion. The lack of response of neutrophil MMPs to dexamethasone was unexpected, given our previous finding that dexamethasone decreased CSF MMP-9 in a cohort of Vietnamese patients with CNS-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The cells other than neutrophils such as the astrocytes, microglial, and neuronal cells also secrete MMP-9 and may contribute to the total suppression of CSF MMP-9 causing the effect that we previously observed. Glucocorticoids are established adjuncts to treatment of CNS-TB and inhibit NF-kB activity through induction of IkB synthesis, among other mechanisms, to decrease inflammatory responses and decrease MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, steroids have significant off-target effects such as immunosuppression, steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, and Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome. Anti-TNF&#x003b1; inhibitors are sometimes used to treat refractory paradoxical reactions in CNS-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and may lead to improved neurological outcome by decreasing MMP-9 secretion.</p><p>Our study has limitations, including the use of chemical inhibitors, which may have off-target effects, to evaluate intracellular signaling pathways in neutrophils. Ideally, selective pathway inhibition using siRNA would be more specific. However, this is technically challenging in primary neutrophils as they die rapidly in vitro and hence, we and others have been unable to proceed with this approach. Also, our findings of TNF&#x003b1; in mediating neutrophil MMP secretion have to be carefully interpreted in clinical care as there is a potential optimal concentration for host control of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While excessive TNF&#x003b1; drives paradoxical TB reactions, blocking TNF&#x003b1; can lead to reactivation of latent TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], so any therapeutic intervention requires very careful evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we show MMP-9 is expressed by neutrophils during the host response in CNS-TB. Neutrophil MMP-9 gene expression and secretion are driven by both direct effects of <italic>M.tb</italic> infection and monocyte-dependent networks. Destruction of type IV collagen, a major component of the BBB, is driven by neutrophil MMP-9. The MAP-kinase and Akt-PI<sub>3</sub> kinase pathways regulate MMP-9 secretion through monocyte-dependent networks but not after direct <italic>M.tb</italic> infection. Neutralizing TNF&#x003b1; significantly suppressed neutrophil MMP-9 secretion and gene expression. Host-directed therapies that target MMPs and the key regulatory pathways should be evaluated to improve neurological and mortality outcomes in CNS-TB.</p></sec>
