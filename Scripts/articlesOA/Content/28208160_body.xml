<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important cause of morbidity and death among the all infectious diseases [<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. New diagnostic tools and therapies are needed. Diagnosis of active TB disease still represents a challenge for the clinical management due to the difficulty related to the detection of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) in sputum [<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, the efficacy of therapy which is evaluated by sputum culture conversion, needs several weeks to get results. Interferon-&#x003b3; Release Assays (IGRAs) are attractive tests for latent TB infection (LTBI) diagnosis. However they have limitations as they cannot distinguish between subjects with LTBI and active TB disease, and are inadequate for monitoring treatment response[<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; moreover they also poorly predict those infected individuals who will progress to active TB[<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, it would be very useful to have a simple and rapid method to screen patients with active TB among the LTBI subjects and to evaluate the anti-microbial therapy success.</p><p>The absolute number of monocytes or lymphocytes in peripheral blood or yet the ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes (ML ratio) predict the risk of active TB development in HIV-infected patients co-infected with Mtb or in children born from HIV-infected mothers[<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, recent data also have highlighted that the increase of the ML ratio is associated with changes of gene transcription in monocytes that may influence their functional anti-mycobacterial profiles. [<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] It has been described that human CD14<sup>+</sup>monocyte are composed by two subsets based on CD16 expression and relative percentages of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes increase along with TB disease severity [<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, whether this unbalance is beneficial or detrimental to host defense remains to be elucidated. Moreover, human monocytes are prone to differentiate towards an anti-inflammatory (M2-like) macrophage activation program during Mtb infection[<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we have investigated on the ML ratio in subjects with LTBI and in patients with active TB before and after anti-mycobacterial therapy, to correlate this value with the different conditions of infection/disease. The expression of different surface molecules in circulating monocytes was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Characteristics of the enrolled individuals</title><p>A total of 173 individuals were prospectively enrolled as here reported and as described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0171358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]: (a) Healthy Donors (HD): 31 individuals tested TST and QFT-IT-negative (9 men, 22 women, median age 37 years); (b) LTBI subjects: 37 individuals (21 men,16 women, median age 43 years) who reported household or equivalent close contacts with smear-positive pulmonary TB patients in the previous 3 months, QFT-IT-positive, with negative chest x-Ray results for active pulmonary lesions and no prior preventive therapy performed; (c) active TB disease: 71 individuals diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (with a positive Mtb culture from sputa or broncholavage, 54 men, 16 women, median range 38 years) who started specific treatment &#x0003c;8 days before enrolment (see <bold><xref rid="pone.0171358.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>);(d) 34 cured TB patients (with a previous microbiological diagnosis, 17 women and 17 men, median age 41). Patients were recruited from the L. Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious diseases, Rome and from the Department of Infectious Disease, University Hospital of Palermo. All patients were treated in accordance with Italian guidelines and received therapy for 6 months. Treatment was successful in all participants, all of whom completed the full course of anti-TB chemotherapy. None of the TB patients had evidence of HIV infection, or was being treated with steroid or other immunosuppressive or anti-tubercular drugs at the time of their first sampling. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the L. Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious diseases in Rome (approval number 2/2007), and by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital in Palermo (approval number 13/2013), where the patients were recruited. Informed consent was signed by all participants.

Four-parameter FCM acquisition and analysis were performed on a two-laser FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For a clear analysis, at least 50,000 total events were analyzed. Samples were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreestarInc Ashland, OR). Monocytes were gated first by forward angle and side scatter profiles, followed by gating on the CD14<sup>+</sup> cell population, and intersecting the two gated populations, for further analysis. Lymphocytes were gated first by forward angle and side scatter profiles, followed by gating on cells expressing CD3, CD19, CD16 and CD56.
