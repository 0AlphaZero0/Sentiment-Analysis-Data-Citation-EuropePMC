<p>Identification of latent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection (LTBI) and prevention of subsequent progression to tuberculosis is the cornerstone of tuberculosis control in most high-income, low-incidence countries (such as those in Europe and the United States) [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>]. However, preventive treatment is long (&#x02265;3 months) and can have significant side effects. It is therefore a clinical imperative to identify persons at greatest risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis. Among immunocompetent individuals (who account for the vast majority of LTBI and tuberculosis cases globally), the single strongest clinical risk factor for progression from LTBI to tuberculosis is time since infection [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with the risk being much higher in the first 2 years after infection (1.5% annual risk) and declining dramatically thereafter (approximately 0.1% annual risk) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, distinguishing recently acquired from remotely acquired LTBI is very challenging, time-consuming, and frequently unreliable in routine clinical practice.</p><p>A blood-based biomarker that could risk-stratify persons with LTBI by distinguishing recently acquired from remotely acquired infection would greatly enhance LTBI screening and contact investigations and reduce the number of people unnecessarily treated. Several studies have identified cellular immune subsets that differ in proportions between patients with tuberculosis and those with LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref>]. We previously identified differences in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific T-cell populations and cytokine secretion profiles in patients with tuberculosis versus those with LTBI. Specifically, we demonstrated that the proportion of purified protein derivative&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells secreting tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) but not interferon &#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) or interleukin 2 (IL-2) which had a differentiated effector memory (CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD127<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) phenotype (TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;only T<sub>EFF</sub>) was able to distinguish tuberculosis from LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Others have also demonstrated that measuring the levels of CD27 expression on <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>specific cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has the potential to distinguish between tuberculosis and LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. For example, the TAM-TB assay, which evaluates the ratio of the median fluorescence intensity of CD27 within the whole CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell population to that of CD27 in the <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>specific IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been shown to distinguish between tuberculosis in LTBI in children and adults [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although it is increasingly believed that LTBI may be biologically heterogeneous, such assays and cellular immune profiling in general have not hitherto been used to dissect different epidemiological subgroups of LTBI that differ with respect to their risk of progression to tuberculosis.</p><p>We hypothesized that the long-term immune control that maintains host-pathogen equilibrium in remotely acquired established LTBI is not yet manifest in recently acquired LTBI where bacillary replication may initially be relatively uncontrolled, thereby resulting in a more differentiated effector T-cell phenotype. We therefore interrogated cellular immune signatures in clinically and epidemiologically precisely phenotyped subjects with LTBI who had clear and substantial differences in reported times since acquisition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study Participants and Recruitment</title><p>Participants were prospectively enrolled between February 2009 and May 2016 during routine National Health Service screening for tuberculosis or LTBI at one of the following National Health Service trusts in the United Kingdom: Imperial College Healthcare, Frimley Health, Bart&#x02019;s Healthcare, and London Northwest.

Previous studies have identified several cellular immune signatures that differ between the clinically distinct states of tuberculosis and asymptomatic LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, none have described distinct immunological signatures within LTBI that correlate with a well-defined risk factor for progression. We have found evidence that LTBI, while clinically homogeneous, with an absence of symptoms and normal chest radiographic findings, is immunologically heterogeneous, with the reported time since acquisition being a major contributing factor to that heterogeneity.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;only T<sub>EFF</sub> signature distinguished tuberculosis from LTBI with high sensitivity and specificity, with the proportion of these cells being significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis than in patients with LTBI, including patients with HIV coinfection [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here we show that the proportion of these cells is significantly higher during recently acquired LTBI as compared to remotely acquired LTBI. Consistent with this novel observation, the difference in the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;only T<sub>EFF</sub> signature between tuberculosis and LTBI reported by Pollock et al was derived from a cohort of subjects with LTBI who had mostly acquired their infection remotely [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We were therefore able to validate the use of this signature when discriminating tuberculosis from remotely acquired LTBI, demonstrating consistently high performance in 2 independent studies and after a CV approach was used in the current data set. Thus, a combined cell surface loss of expression of CD45RA, CCR7, and CD127 on <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is associated with both tuberculosis and recently acquired LTBI but not with remotely acquired LTBI.</p><p>Loss of CD27 expression on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been shown to be associated with tuberculosis when compared to LTBI in multiple studies. In this study, 2 signatures incorporating such measurements did not differ significantly between recently acquired and remotely acquired LTBI in our cohort. This indicates that loss of CD27 expression on <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while associated with clinical disease [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>], is not related to time since infection in patients with LTBI. However, we did demonstrate that both the TAM-TB assay and the proportions of CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differed between patients with tuberculosis and those with LTBI. We thus independently validated the ability of these signatures for discriminating tuberculosis from LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], supporting their reproducibility.</p><p>Very few other studies to date have subclassified individuals with LTBI by using time since infection, when exploring immunological signatures. One study demonstrated that an innate immune cell subset, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (which are known to suppress CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell function), was significantly increased during both tuberculosis and recently acquired LTBI, compared with treated tuberculosis and remotely acquired LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is consistent with our findings that recently acquired LTBI appears immunologically comparable to tuberculosis.</p><p>The range in the proportions of TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;only T<sub>EFF</sub> cells in the recently acquired LTBI group in the current study was far wider than range of those in the remotely acquired LTBI group, likely reflecting the relative heterogeneity in terms of the risk of progression that exists for patients with recently acquired LTBI, compared with the homogeneity of responses and very low risk of progression for patients with remotely acquired LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies involving <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>infected macaques have demonstrated that the total pulmonary bacterial burden, as well as the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burden within specific lesions in the lung, are higher in both recent infection and clinically manifest active disease, compared with established (ie, remotely acquired) LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These microbiological data from the lungs of infected macaques support our immunological findings that recently acquired LTBI is more similar than remotely acquired LTBI to tuberculosis. We speculate that patients in the LTBI group who have a higher TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;only T<sub>EFF</sub> response, which overlaps most with the tuberculosis group, may be more likely to progress to tuberculosis. However, given that most of our cohort subsequently received LTBI treatment, we were unable to test this hypothesis in this study. Once validated in an independent cohort, a test measuring the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;only T<sub>EFF</sub> signature could be further developed as a second-line test to an IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;release assay, to substantially reduce the proportion of patients with remotely acquired LTBI who are offered treatment, while still identifying all patients with recently acquired infection.</p><p>The potential for particular mycobacterial antigens to elicit differential immune responses in distinct subgroups of individuals with LTBI has previously been investigated. Although differential responses to putative &#x0201c;latency-associated&#x0201d; antigens have been identified [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref>], these have not hitherto been shown to correlate with progression to tuberculosis, the clinical risk of progression, or any other clinical parameter. A recent study in individuals with long-standing LTBI identified some immunological differences that appeared to correlate with an unvalidated online risk calculator [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, since the study population had been infected for an average of 12 years and there were no individuals with recently acquired LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the participants were neither at risk of progression nor eligible for LTBI treatment according to guidelines. The study identified differences in the measured immunological parameters between treated and untreated LTBI, which has been shown previously for other immune signatures during both tuberculosis [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>] and LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Although our cohort is defined by high-quality and detailed demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data, coupled with stringent criteria for recently acquired versus remotely acquired LTBI, one can never be certain precisely when a given individual acquired infection, and we cannot control for recall bias. We therefore chose to compare 2 subgroups of patients with LTBI with considerably different reported times since exposure to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, based on the extensive epidemiological information we systematically collected for this study (not as part of routine practice), and we excluded those who did not meet our stringent predefined criteria. Despite this, we cannot be certain that some individuals in the recently acquired LTBI group had not actually acquired their current infection remotely. To address this problem, we performed an even stricter analysis, in which patients with recently acquired LTBI who had any risk of having been exposed at a different time to the identified recent exposure were excluded, with no impact on the performance of the signature.</p><p>All of the signatures presented here are measures of immune responses to purified protein derivative, a crude mixture of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens that elicits strong, predominantly CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell cytokine responses. Although this confers good sensitivity for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the immunological assays used here, the specificity is impaired because of cross-reactivity in BCG-vaccinated individuals. Thus, in clinical practice, these signatures would likely be used as a risk-stratification tool for subjects with positive results of the ESAT-6/CFP-10&#x02013;based IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;release assay, which does reliably distinguish individuals with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection from recipients of BCG vaccine [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hence, the antigenic cross-reactivity of purified protein derivative used in our immune signatures would not be a problem in clinical practice. Staining for CD27 was not included for all experiments performed in this study. Therefore, the sample size may have lacked sufficient statistical power to detect differences in CD27 expression on <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells between patients with recently acquired LTBI and those with remotely acquired LTBI.</p><p>To validate our findings, a larger study in an independent population is now required before this test can be considered as a screening test for recently acquired LTBI. Ultimately, quantification of the forward risk associated with the respective immune signatures will require a long-term prospective longitudinal cohort study of individuals with LTBI followed up to assess for progression to tuberculosis and correlation with baseline immune signatures. In this study, we were able to evaluate 3 immune signatures that assess the memory and maturation phenotype of <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>specific T cells and that have previously been shown to differentiate tuberculosis and LTBI.</p><p>Our findings represent a significant advance on current tests of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, which cannot differentiate recently acquired from remotely acquired LTBI [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although the clinical unmet need for a test to risk-stratify persons with LTBI and thereby better target preventive treatment is large and urgent [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the notion that immunological markers might distinguish recently acquired from remotely acquired LTBI is relatively novel. Our findings suggest that an immune-based test could be used to differentiate between different types of LTBI and, if validated in subsequent larger longitudinal studies, could usefully risk-stratify persons with LTBI for targeted preventive treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s13"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
