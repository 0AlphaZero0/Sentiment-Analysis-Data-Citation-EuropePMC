<sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Finger stick blood collection is a practical and minimally invasive sample collection method that is used for a wide range of applications in routine clinical practice and can be implemented outside of clinical settings. It is for instance by this means that millions of individuals collect daily small blood volumes to monitor sugar levels.</p><p>More recently, availability of high throughput profiling technologies made it possible to measure simultaneously the abundance of tens of thousands of analytes. For instance, transcriptome profiling, which measures abundance of RNA on a genome-wide scale has become a mainstay in biomedical research settings
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. This approach can be implemented through the use of technologies such as microarray and more recently RNA-sequencing. Robust and more cost-effective &#x0201c;meso-scale&#x0201d; profiling technologies, relying for instance on PCR or NanoString probes, can profile the abundance of hundreds of genes
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Blood transcriptome profiling has proven useful in generating high-resolution molecular phenotypes: to investigate pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>; to develop biomarker signatures
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; and to assess response to vaccines or therapies
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. More recently, an approach consisting in correlating serial blood transcriptome signatures with clinical course of disease was described as a means to guide development and selection of novel therapeutic modalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Transcriptome profiling studies have initially employed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. PBMCs are isolated by fractionation and are enriched in blood leukocytes. It is also a type of sample from which high quality RNA can be reliably obtained, which at the time was not the case of whole blood. However, the PBMC preparation procedure involves multiple steps and important variations are introduced between the time of blood draw and preparation of the cell lysates
<sup><xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is a time consuming process that requires trained personnel and equipment and is not straightforward to implement in most clinical settings. Whole blood RNA stabilization systems; PAXgene&#x02122; (Qiagen) and Tempus&#x02122; (Life Technologies) have been adopted as they became available and are now widely used. Several studies have compared the performance of these 2 commercial kits and found differences in gene expression profiles, RNA quality and yield
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Reported yields and quality of RNA stabilized in Tempus solution was generally greater. Thus, the choice of RNA stabilizing reagent used to preserve samples can indeed be important and affect subsequent RNA quantity and quality. Our choice of the tempus system over PaxGene dates from side-by-side comparisons we have performed over 10 years ago. However the vast majority of the studies carried out to date use relatively large volumes of venous blood
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Collection of small volumes of blood via finger sticks is especially indicated for high frequency sample collection to enable monitoring of the immune status of individuals in health and disease
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Advantages of this collection modality stem from the fact that it is less invasive, faster and does not require a trained phlebotomist. Therefore, it is more amenable to field applications and in home self-collection for proximity testing. A study by Obermoser
<italic>et al.,</italic> employed this collection method to investigate transcriptome responses elicited by influenza and pneumococcal vaccines at 8 different time points in the 48 hours following vaccine administration
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. A methods development article has also been published by Robinson
<italic>et al.,</italic> demonstrating that RNA quality and gene expression data obtained from blood obtained via finger stick (70 &#x003bc;L) and venipuncture (2.5 mL) are highly comparable
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Since version 1 of our SOP came out in F1000Research
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> we have published a paper describing results of a study in which weekly in home self-finger stick blood collection was undertaken by 13 subjects with type 1 diabetes and 14 controls for a period of 6 months
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Subjects returned an average of 24 out of 26 total weekly samples, and transcript data were successfully obtained for &#x0003e;99% of samples returned. A high degree of correlation between finger stick data and data from a standard 3 mL venipuncture sample was observed. RNA yields obtained from blood volumes ranging from 10, 15, 20, and 25 &#x003bc;L indicated that those volumes were sufficient to generate the 100 ng of RNA needed for high throughput real time-PCR
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. However, the detailed procedure for finger stick blood collection and RNA stabilization employed in this and other studies has never been published.</p><p>The standard operating procedure that we are sharing with this report will be published as part of our molecular profiling of pregnancy channel. Indeed, it was specifically developed for collection and stabilization of 50 &#x003bc;l of blood collected via a finger stick in a pregnancy monitoring study currently being conducted on the Thai-Myanmar border. It will consist of measuring changes in blood transcript abundance in 400 women during the second and third trimester of their pregnancy. A complete description of this study will be provided elsewhere.</p><sec><title>Narrative of the procedure</title><p>The procedure described in this article can be employed for serial blood collection in clinical or research laboratory settings as well as for in-home self-collection. A narrative is provided here, along with general remarks and considerations. A detailed point-by-point SOP follows.</p><p>Narrative: Tempus RNA tubes are designed for the collection of 3 ml of blood via venipuncture and contain 6 ml of a proprietary RNA stabilizing reagent. For the collection of 50 &#x003bc;l blood samples 100 &#x003bc;l of the RNA stabilizing reagent is aliquoted in microfuge tubes. Blood is collected with a plastic capillary straw. Immediately after collection, the tube is shaken vigorously to disrupt the blood cells for at least 20 seconds. A sufficient quantity of RNA for downstream processing was obtained when tubes were flicked, pipetted, or vortexed, but was reduced when samples were not mixed at all. Lysis of blood cells occurs upon thoroughly mixing the blood drawn into the tube and the stabilizing reagent. Furthermore, RNases are inactivated and the freed RNA is selectively precipitated and thus further protected from degradation. Effective stabilization of the RNA ensures that the transcriptional profile is maintained and will accurately reflect the physiological state of the patient at the time of the blood draw. RNA properly collected in Tempus solution and stored at -20&#x000b0;C or -80&#x000b0;C will remain stable for minimum of 6 years
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><p>
<underline>General remarks</underline>: After over 10 years of use across a wide range of clinical settings RNA stabilization using tempus solution has in our hands proven robust and reliable. However there are a few things that we have learned that are worth sharing:</p><p>1)
<underline>Finger stick</underline>: The finger is usually the preferred site for capillary testing in an adult patient. When samples are collected serially it is recommended to choose a different finger from the one used for the last procedure to prevent bruising. The sides of the heel are only used in pediatric and neonatal patients. The guidance given in Section 7.1 of the WHO guidelines on blood drawing: best practices in phlebotomy, can help decide whether to use a finger or heel-stick, and with the selection of an appropriately sized lancet
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>2)
<underline>Blood volumes</underline>: The volume can be adjusted depending on the application. Typical yield from 50 &#x003bc;l of blood is the minimum about 500 ng of total RNA. Procedures for RNA extraction and quality control will be shared in a separate publication (Anguiano E., Rinchai D., Tomei S., Chaussabel D., unpublished report). A study was conducted where as little as 15 &#x003bc;l of blood was collected, which was sufficient to run a high throughput Fluidigm PCR assay
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Such small blood volumes can also be obtained serially from mice, which allow longitudinal monitoring of individual animals. In human studies, instead of using a capillary straw small blood volumes can also be collected and measured with a micropipette. The blood is then placed into the microfuge tube containing the tempus solution. This can be done when collecting small volumes of blood from a finger stick or obtaining a small aliquot of blood from a larger venous blood draw.</p><p>3)
<underline>Volume of RNA stabilization solution</underline>: The appropriate ratio of [Blood : RNA stabilizing reagent] is 1 volume of blood for 2 volumes of tempus solution (in our case 50 &#x003bc;l of blood in 100 &#x003bc;l of RNA stabilizing reagent). Loss in RNA quality and quantity will be observed if this ratio is not respected. Collecting more blood will actually result in decreased yields and RNA quality. In cases when the amount of blood collected is lower, the volume of tempus solution can be adjusted accordingly when feasible. The same ratio can be used when working with mouse blood collected from the tail vein using a similar procedure (as mentioned above blood volumes can be lowered to 15 &#x003bc;l). The volumetric ratio is usually lower when working with non-human primate species (e.g. 1:3, 1:4) and should be determined on a species-by-species basis (a 1:3 ratio is used when collecting blood from macaques
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>).</p><p>4)
<underline>Sample mixing</underline>: This, after maintaining an appropriate blood: tempus solution ratio, is the second most critical aspect of the procedure, and a potential cause of sample failure. As mentioned above samples must be homogenized by thorough mixing in order to disrupt cells and release their RNA cargo. The RNA will precipitate in the tempus solution and in this form is protected from degradation by the RNAses that are present in the sample.</p><p>5)
<underline>Temperature</underline>: RNA should remain in a precipitated state at &#x0201c;room temperature&#x0201d;. Although refrigeration and freezing at the earliest possible time is recommended, based on our observations keeping the blood lysates at room temperature (25&#x000b0;C) for up to 24 hours should not affect RNA quality. Samples can be stored at 4&#x000b0;C (refrigerator or cold packs) for up to 48 hours, which can simplify the logistics associated with temporary storage, transfer and shipping of samples post-collection. Based on information provided by the manufacturer RNA should remain in a precipitated state as long as temperatures remain below 30&#x000b0;C. It may therefore be necessary to take precaution when working in warm climates.</p><p>6)
<underline>Storage and shipping</underline>: After collecting the blood sample should be kept cold at 4&#x000b0;C no longer than 48 hours and transferred to a -20&#x000b0;C or -80&#x000b0;C freezer for long-term storage. By default, samples are stored in the lab at -20&#x000b0;C. Data obtained using a limited set of samples frozen overnight showed that the RNA yield for samples stored at -80&#x000b0;C was about half the yield of same blood samples stored at -20&#x000b0;C, but was nevertheless still amply sufficient for downstream analyses. It should also be noted that the plastic tempus tubes are made of will become brittle at temperatures lower than -20&#x000b0;C. The effect of storage temperature on RNA yield and quality will have to be evaluated further, especially over extended periods of time where storage at lower temperatures might show benefits (see also referees comments and our response for more details). Shipments are made on dry ice although for overnight shipping in cooler climates using ice packs should be sufficient (however testing using mock samples is recommended). When shipping &#x0201c;off the shelf&#x0201d; tempus tubes direct contact with dry ice should be avoided to prevent breakage. When shipping on dry ice attention should be paid to the thickness of the walls of the polystyrene container holding the tubes along with the dry ice. The thinner the walls the faster the shipment will run out of dry ice. This is especially important to consider when contemplating longer transit times and/or warm weather conditions. Regarding biosafety, we have found the tempus solution to prevent growth of bacteria known for their resilience such as
<italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (Rinchai D, unpublished report), and thus conclude that threat of contamination via tempus blood lysates is likely to be low. However, appropriate testing should be carried out on a case-by-case basis and all procedures in the laboratory involving tempus lysates should be consistent with standard blood handling procedures.</p><p>7)
<underline>Safety</underline>: The hazardous nature of the tempus solution would make extensive roll out of the collection procedure described in this manuscript problematic and is at the moment clearly intended for research use under well controlled conditions, with preferably collection carried out by trained personnel. However, it should be noted that it has been-field tested for in-home self-collection in a limited number of subject over a period of 6 months without incident
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. The fact that small volumes of solution are used may alleviate some concerns (30 microliters of solution for 15 microliters of blood in the above-mentioned study, vs 6 ml of solution for 3 ml of blood using &#x0201c;off the shelf&#x0201d; tempus collection tubes). However, other technical solutions in which liquids are better contained may indeed be preferable (e.g. microfluidics card, sponges), with one of the best example being the recently developed &#x0201c;DxCollect&#x0201d; system (DxTerity, Rancho Dominguez, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and equipment</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Tempus
