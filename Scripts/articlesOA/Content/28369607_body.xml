<sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a major public health problem: in 2015, 1.8 million people died of TB, with 22% of these deaths occurring in HIV-1 coinfected individuals (<xref rid="msx107-B81" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization 2016</xref>). The synergy between the two diseases is complex: infection with HIV-1 greatly increases the risk of developing TB even before CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts decrease, and coinfection leads to acceleration of both diseases (<xref rid="msx107-B16" ref-type="bibr">Deffur et al. 2013</xref>). To develop better approaches to control the syndemic more information is required on how these two pathogens interact with humans.</p><p>One tool that might be of utility is comparative genomics. Not long after the first bacterial genome sequence was published (<xref rid="msx107-B22" ref-type="bibr">Fleishmann et al. 1995</xref>), the genome sequence of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> was determined (<xref rid="msx107-B9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al. 1998</xref>), providing important insights into the biology of this pathogen. Since then, the number of sequenced mycobacterial genomes has rapidly increased owing to decreasing costs of, and greater accessibility to, whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology (<xref rid="msx107-B56" ref-type="bibr">Niemann and Supply 2014</xref>). Although <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is still considered genetically monomorphic compared with other bacterial species (<xref rid="msx107-B2" ref-type="bibr">Achtman 2008</xref>, <xref rid="msx107-B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), recent WGS data have revealed previously unappreciated degrees of genetic diversity that may have important clinical implications (<xref rid="msx107-B24" ref-type="bibr">Gagneux and Small 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B70" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B17" ref-type="bibr">Eldholm et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B56" ref-type="bibr">Niemann and Supply 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B42" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggests that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> evolved from a common ancestor in Africa, and spread globally with human migration and trade to give rise to a contemporary phylogeny comprising seven main human-adapted lineages (<xref rid="msx107-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hershberg et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B11" ref-type="bibr">Comas et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B25" ref-type="bibr">Galagan 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B8" ref-type="bibr">Brites and Gagneux, 2015</xref>). These lineages are associated with particular geographic regions (<xref rid="msx107-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hirsh et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hershberg et al. 2008</xref>) suggesting sympatric host-pathogen adaptation (<xref rid="msx107-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fenner et al. 2013</xref>). A population-wide study conducted in Switzerland revealed that HIV disrupts the sympatric relationship between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and particular host populations (<xref rid="msx107-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fenner et al. 2013</xref>). However, this study was conducted in a region with very low HIV and TB prevalence; transmission patterns might be different in settings where disease burdens are higher and therefore transmission more intense.</p><p>In a well-defined, peri-urban community in South Africa, with extremely high HIV-1 and TB prevalence, RFLP typing of strains collected over a 10-year period showed that there was little HIV-specific clustering of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains (<xref rid="msx107-B48" ref-type="bibr">Middelkoop et al. 2009</xref>). However, in the mixed clusters, a greater proportion of index cases were HIV uninfected, suggesting that HIV coinfection reduces the likelihood of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transmission (<xref rid="msx107-B50" ref-type="bibr">Middelkoop et al. 2015</xref>). A population-based study in Malawi, which was one of the first to apply WGS to investigate TB transmission, also found that increased transmission was not associated with HIV coinfection. This study did not, however, assess the directionality of transmission (<xref rid="msx107-B26" ref-type="bibr">Guerra-Assun&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o et al. 2015</xref>). Application of epidemiological models to WGS data to study an MDR-TB outbreak in South America, suggest that while HIV coinfection does not lead to increased transmission of TB, HIV coinfected individuals are more susceptible to TB (<xref rid="msx107-B18" ref-type="bibr">Eldholm et al. 2016</xref>). These studies are consistent with the suggestion that, in settings with high disease burdens, transmission of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from HIV uninfected people to HIV infected people is likely driving the HIV/TB syndemic (<xref rid="msx107-B50" ref-type="bibr">Middelkoop et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Host&#x02013;pathogen interactions have also been investigated using comparative analyses of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> WGS data. Studies have revealed that, whereas a small number of antigen-encoding loci in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> display variability that appears consistent with selection favoring antibody escape (<xref rid="msx107-B12" ref-type="bibr">Coscolla et al. 2015</xref>), loci encoding human T-cell epitopes are, counterintuitively, generally conserved (<xref rid="msx107-B10" ref-type="bibr">Comas et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B12" ref-type="bibr">Coscolla et al. 2015</xref>). This suggests either that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> requires immune recognition to establish or maintain disease, or that evasion of T-cell mediated immunity is effected by other mechanisms. Since <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is able to adapt to the selective pressures imposed by TB chemotherapy (<xref rid="msx107-B20" ref-type="bibr">Farhat et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B55" ref-type="bibr">Nebenzahl-Guimaraes et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>), it is unlikely that antigen conservation reflects an inability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to efficiently accumulate immune evasion SNPs: epitope conservation may instead fulfil a specific, selectively advantageous, biological function (<xref rid="msx107-B12" ref-type="bibr">Coscolla et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>A widespread measure used to evaluate the strength and direction of natural selection is the ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions in protein coding sequences (<xref rid="msx107-B4" ref-type="bibr">Anisimova and Kosiol 2009</xref>). Nonsynonymous substitutions result in amino acid changes and are therefore more likely than synonymous substitutions (which do not result in amino acid changes) to influence the functions of encoded proteins. When observed rates of nonsynonymous substitution are disproportionately <italic>higher</italic> than rates of synonymous substitution, it implies that natural selection is likely favoring changes in protein coding sequences that are presumably functionally adaptive: this type of selection is usually referred to as positive selection (<xref rid="msx107-B4" ref-type="bibr">Anisimova and Kosiol 2009</xref>). Conversely, when observed rates of nonsynonymous substitution are disproportionately <italic>lower</italic> than rates of synonymous substitution, it implies that natural selection is favoring preservation of the protein coding sequences: this is negative or purifying selection (<xref rid="msx107-B4" ref-type="bibr">Anisimova and Kosiol 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we applied comparative genomics to investigate the impact of HIV-1 coinfection on the evolution of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in a TB and HIV-1 endemic setting. WGS data were generated for 192 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> samples isolated from individuals in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa: a region with one of the highest rates of HIV-1-associated TB in the world (<xref rid="msx107-B13" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al. 2014</xref>). Phylogenetically informed evaluation of relative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates was used to investigate differences in patterns of natural selection between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains isolated from HIV-1 coinfected individuals versus uninfected individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phylogeny and Drug Resistance Patterns of <italic>M.</italic><italic>t</italic><italic>uberculosis</italic> Strains</title><p>Of the 192 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates that were sequenced, data for four isolates were not included due to under-representation in the multiplexed sequencing library, and data for a further 18 isolates was removed from the analysis due to average sequencing coverage being below 10-fold. One strain isolated from an individual with unknown HIV-1 status was also removed prior to analysis. The mean and median genome sequencing coverage for the 169 strains taken forward for analysis was 80.5 (Standard deviation&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.9) and 96.2 (Interquartile range&#x02009;=&#x02009;77.0&#x02013;90.8) fold, respectively. As expected for this region of South Africa (<xref rid="msx107-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hanekom et al. 2013</xref>), most of the strains belonged to either lineage 2 (26.0%) or lineage 4 (68.6%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="msx107-T1">table 1</xref>). A small number of strains belonged to lineage 1 (one strain from an HIV-1 uninfected participant) or lineage 3 (three strains, all from HIV-1 coinfected participants). Lineage 2 and lineage 4 strains isolated from HIV-1 coinfected participants made up 16.6% and 33.7% of the sample, and there was no significant association between these <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages and HIV-1 status. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using all aligned SNP sites, together with strains representative of global <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> diversity (<xref rid="msx107-B10" ref-type="bibr">Comas et al. 2010</xref>) which were included to contextualize the South African sequences within the global <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msx107-F1">fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online).

The second was to apply the MEDS method to detect episodic directional selection that may be influenced by HIV-1 coinfection.</p><p>Some studies (<xref rid="msx107-B63" ref-type="bibr">Rocha et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B38" ref-type="bibr">Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B52" ref-type="bibr">Mugal et al. 2014</xref>) have suggested that when analyzing sequences that are too closely related, dN/dS estimates may not accurately reflect degrees of natural selection acting upon the sequences. The FUBAR analysis provides evidence that sufficient time has passed since the most recent common ancestor of the sequences analyzed for selection to have left a detectable imprint. Specifically, this legitimacy of using the FUBAR approach is supported by the fact that it enabled 1) the detection of almost all of the same positively evolving <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> codon sites that were identified in another study applying similar codon-model based approaches (<xref rid="msx107-B57" ref-type="bibr">Os&#x000f3;rio et al. 2013</xref>), and 2) the identification of some drug resistance associated SNPs as evolving under positive selection.</p><p>An advantage of using FUBAR to detect the action of natural selection is that it simultaneously quantifies magnitude of both positive and negative selection at individual codon sites. Among the codon sites that contained SNPs in the analyzed <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes, 99.47% were detectably evolving under negative selection (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23,763) while only 0.52% were detectably evolving under positive selection (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;125) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msx107-F2">fig. 2</xref>), which is in line with findings previously reported in other studies (<xref rid="msx107-B58" ref-type="bibr">Pepperell et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>A key aim of our study was to determine if HIV-1 coinfection, which represents a relatively recent addition to the adaptive landscape upon which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> evolves (<xref rid="msx107-B79" ref-type="bibr">Warner et al. 2015</xref>), has had a detectable influence on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> evolution. To do this, each SNP containing codon site was evaluated using the MEDS method to determine whether selection pressures acting on these codon sites could differ between HIV-1 coinfected and HIV-1 uninfected individuals (<xref rid="msx107-B53" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. 2012</xref>). In a recent study, <xref rid="msx107-B18" ref-type="bibr">Eldholm et al. (2016)</xref> investigated the impact of HIV on the transmission and development of drug resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="msx107-B18" ref-type="bibr">Eldholm et al. 2016</xref>). The results of that study suggest that HIV has little impact on the transmission of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and that drug resistance does not develop faster in patients coinfected with HIV. However, our study is the first to conduct a genome-wide site-by-site investigation of the impact of HIV-1 on natural selection in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>The first of three codons with associated Bonferroni corrected MEDS <italic>P</italic> values indicative of HIV-1 influenced directional selection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msx107-T4">table 4</xref>) occurs in <italic>celA2b</italic>, a nonessential gene which encodes a functional endoglucanase (<xref rid="msx107-B47" ref-type="bibr">Medie et al. 2011</xref>). The second occurred in <italic>katG</italic>, which encodes a catalase-peroxidase enzyme that is important for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> virulence and is known for its association with INH resistance (<xref rid="msx107-B59" ref-type="bibr">Pym et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B82" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B80" ref-type="bibr">Wengenack et al. 2004</xref>), also had significant evidence of HIV-1 influenced directional selection. The third codon occurred in <italic>cyp138</italic>, a cytochrome P450 encoding gene (<xref rid="msx107-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hudson et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>The biological significance of these codons during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>/HIV-1 coinfection was not obvious, therefore we determined whether there were either direct or indirect known functional interactions between the proteins encoded by these genes and human proteins that are known to interact with HIV-1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msx107-F4">fig. 4</xref>). Both CelA2b and KatG are involved in an interaction pathway that, via SodB and ultimately GroEL1, leads to DC-SIGN, an important receptor for both HIV-1 and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> on DC (<xref rid="msx107-B74" ref-type="bibr">van Kooyk et al. 2003</xref>). Although these interactions may begin to explain why these <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sites display evidence of directional selection influenced by HIV-1 coinfection, these findings would benefit further investigation in experimental systems.</p><p>The results of the MEDS analysis also indicated differences in directional selection influenced by HIV-1 coinfection at codon sites falling in different gene categories. The proportion of sites with associated MEDS <italic>P</italic> values of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was higher in the epitope category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msx107-F5">fig. 5</xref>) than in either the essential or nonessential gene categories. Importantly, the enrichment in epitopes was not observed when the MEDS analysis was rerun with either HIV-positive infection status as the background state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msx107-F5">fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online) or following 100 randomizations of the HIV-infection statuses of the individuals from which the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates were isolated. This indicates that the observed enrichment in epitopes of codons potentially evolving under directional selection influenced by HIV-1 coinfection is unlikely to be an artifact of the underlying assumptions of the evolutionary model applied.</p><p>Nevertheless, 92.66% of the 640 sites we selected as being enriched for elevated signals of potential directional selection influenced by HIV-1 coinfection had MEDS derived <italic>P</italic> values ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 (i.e., these sites individually displayed evidence of directional selection). Only a few nonsynonymous mutations were observed at each of these sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online), and it is therefore important to reiterate that a proportion of these 640 sites are likely false positives. Therefore, while we are confident that the signal of elevated HIV-1 influenced directional selection at epitope sites that we detected by collectively considering all of these &#x0201c;marginally significant&#x0201d; sites is present in the particular <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> data set that we have examined, it would be desirable to validate findings in an independent data set. This is particularly so because our study is the first which has applied methods such as MEDS to analyzing data sets with a degree of genetic diversity that is as low as that found in our <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> data set.</p><p>Besides those already mentioned there are several additional caveats associated with the analysis performed here. The duration of the HIV-1 and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections prior to strain isolation could not be determined. This is important: uncertainty about when during the evolutionary history of a group of coding sequences a particular environmental variable changed (in this case HIV-1 status), undermines the power of methods such as MEDS to attribute specific encoded amino acid changes to specific changes in the environmental variable. Nevertheless, simulated and empirical data set analyses have indicated that MEDS is reasonably conservative and, provided sequences assigned to the two groups are mixed in the phylogeny (as is the case here where there are not large clusters of exclusively HIV-1 coinfected or HIV-1 uninfected sequences), it is robust to uncertainty regarding the precise positions along an analyzed phylogeny where the environmental variable switched states (<xref rid="msx107-B53" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>The second additional caveat is that the genetic diversity of HIV-1 infection may be important when considering the global significance of these results. Several studies have suggested that variation in rates of disease progression (<xref rid="msx107-B73" ref-type="bibr">Touloumi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B51" ref-type="bibr">Mlisana et al. 2014</xref>), transmissibility (<xref rid="msx107-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abraha et al. 2009</xref>), and decline in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers are associated with the genotype of HIV-1 such that, for example, viruses belonging to one subtype might in general be more transmissible than those in another subtype (<xref rid="msx107-B5" ref-type="bibr">Ari&#x000eb;n et al. 2007</xref>). This study was conducted in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa, where HIV-1 subtype C accounts for&#x02009;&#x0003e;99% of all HIV-1 infections (<xref rid="msx107-B32" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al. 2006</xref>). In cohorts with different rates of HIV-1 associated TB or where different HIV-1 subtype(s) predominate, the coevolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may be different. This provides further motivation to repeat this analysis on different cohorts.</p><p>These caveats notwithstanding, we have effectively used MEDS and FUBAR as computational methods to uncover new hypotheses that could potentially be subject to downstream experimentation. The application here of sophisticated codon evolution models to detect HIV-1 influenced selection in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> paves the way both for future investigations of larger, more carefully defined, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> WGS data sets to validate the findings, and for studies seeking to determine whether there are specific underlying molecular causes of differential selection pressures on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in HIV-1 coinfected and uninfected individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample Selection Criteria</title><p>One-hundred and ninety two <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates were selected from three separate clinical studies performed between 2008 and 2010 (<xref rid="msx107-B6" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B7" ref-type="bibr">Boehme et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B33" ref-type="bibr">Kaforou et al. 2013</xref>).

To assemble codon alignments individual SNPs were mapped to codons in the H37Rv annotation, following which codons on the sense and antisense strands were extracted and assembled into codon alignments. Since SNPs occurred in genes located in both the sense and antisense orientations of the genome, two codon alignments were generated. These two alignments were separately analyzed with the FUBAR (<xref rid="msx107-B54" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. 2013</xref>) and MEDS (<xref rid="msx107-B53" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. 2012</xref>) methods implemented in HYPHY (<xref rid="msx107-B37" ref-type="bibr">Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2005</xref>). For FUBAR, the universal genetic code was used (as no specific bacterial code is available for the analysis); parameters changed from default settings were: (1) 10 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were used in phase 3, (2) the length of each chain was increased to 1,000,000, (3) the first 50,000 links of each chain were discarded as burn-in, (4) 300 postburn-in samples were drawn from each chain, and (5) the concentration of the Dirichlet prior was set to 0.5. Although FUBAR is useful for identifying overall patterns of natural selection at amino acid encoding sites, it could not be used to analyze differential selection pressures on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> within HIV-1 coinfected and HIV-1 uninfected individuals. The reason for this is that to estimate the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, the FUBAR method derives information about the evolutionary history of the sequences being analyzed from the present time back till their most recent common ancestor: a history which in our case would have been largely shared between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains sampled from HIV-1 coinfected and uninfected individuals.</p><p>In order to differentiate between selection acting on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains within HIV-1 uninfected and HIV-1 coinfected individuals it was necessary to apply a selection analysis approach such as that implemented in the MEDS method (<xref rid="msx107-B53" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. 2012</xref>). The MEDS method identifies signals of directional selection associated with a specific environmental variable (in this case HIV-1 coinfection). To do this sequences are labelled as being on either the &#x0201c;foreground&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;background&#x0201d; branches of a phylogenetic tree based on the value of an associated binary variable, such as, in our case, the HIV-1 status of the patient from which the sequences were sampled. The foreground/background designations provide a frame of reference indicating the directionality (from background to foreground) of the selection that is to be assessed. The MEDS method then identifies codon sites as being directionally selected when these incur nonsynonymous substitutions that preferentially map to phylogenetic tree branches that separate the background branches from the foreground branches. Previous studies have suggested that in settings where both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and HIV prevalence are high, the polarity of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transmission is primarily from HIV uninfected individuals to HIV coinfected individuals (<xref rid="msx107-B50" ref-type="bibr">Middelkoop et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msx107-B18" ref-type="bibr">Eldholm et al. 2016</xref>). Therefore, for the MEDS analysis phylogenetic tree branches leading to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sequences from HIV-1 coinfected individuals were labeled as being in the foreground, and all other branches of the phylogentic tree were labeled as being in the background. To approximate the probability that potentially directionally selected sites occurred more frequently in particular gene categories than could be accounted for by chance we devised a permutation test where the HIV-1 status of the analyzed <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes were randomly shuffled amongst the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sequences. Altogether 100 separate permutated data sets were analyzed with MEDS as above. For a particular site category (such as essential gene, nonessential gene or epitope), the proportion of permuted data sets where the same number or more directionally selected sites was observed than was observed in the real data set represented the approximate probability of the observed number of directionally selected sites occurring in that site category by chance alone.</p><p>As an additional control, MEDS was run with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sequences from HIV-1 uninfected individuals in the foreground and those from HIV-1 coinfected individuals in the background. Results of the MEDS and FUBAR analyses were filtered to exclude sites that occur in regions (<xref rid="msx107-B12" ref-type="bibr">Coscolla et al. 2015</xref>) for which short-read sequencing data might be unreliable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online).
