<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a deltaretrovirus estimated to infect around 10 million people worldwide[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with no clinical evidence of infection in the majority of carriers. The life-long risk of developing HTLV-1-associated pathology is approximately 10%, while 0.3 to 4% of HTLV-1 carriers will present a neurodegenerative disorder with clinical similarities to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) called HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP)[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other inflammatory autoimmune-like conditions including Sj&#x000f6;gren syndrome, uveitis and arthritis have been reported to be associated with HTLV-1 infection[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. HTLV-1 is also the causative agent of an aggressive type of lymphoproliferative disorder called Adult T-cell leukemia[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HTLV-1-infected subjects have also an increased susceptibility to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], suggesting an immunological impairment[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The role of the various T-cell subsets in the immune response to infection HTLV-1 and how it influences the control or the development of disease is not fully understood.</p><p>CD4+ T cells are the primary targets of HTLV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The immunodominant viral proteins Tax and HBZ modulate CD4 T-cell machinery upon infection, promoting cell activation, replication and survival[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The high frequency of HTLV-1-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral blood seen in HAM/TSP patients suggest that T-cell responses do not prevent development of disease, contributing instead to the proinflammatory milieu characteristic of HTLV-1 related syndromes[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other T-cell subsets such as NKT cells were investigated in the context of HTLV-1 infection[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but many aspects of the immunopathogenesis of HTLV-1 related diseases and why HTLV-1 patients are more susceptible to Mtb are still unexplored.</p><p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of innate T cells recently identified. In human, they express a semi-invariant TCR using V&#x003b1;7.2 coupled with J&#x003b1;33 and have a limited V&#x003b2; repertoire[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. They can represent 1&#x02013;10% of circulating T cells in healthy individuals. They are restricted by the MHC class I-like protein MR1 that presents microbial vitamin B2 metabolites (riboflavin)[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MAIT cells have been shown to recognize a variety of pathogens, including Mtb <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MAIT cells can also be activated indirectly by IL-12 and IL18[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MAIT cells have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of chronic viral infections like HIV[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and HCV[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and in inflammatory conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and MS[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that HTLV-1 infection is associated with defect in MAIT cells that could explain the increased susceptibility to Mtb.</p><p>In this study, we determined the frequency, phenotype, and functionality of MAIT cells in a cohort of HTLV-1-infected subjects. Here, we describe for the first time phenotypic and functional alterations in MAIT cells of HTLV-1-infected individuals and discuss the implications such alterations might have in HAM/TSP and in the immune response of HTLV-1-infected subjects to other pathogens, specifically Mtb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Human subjects</title><p>We selected 20 HTLV-1 patients from the HTLV-1 outpatient clinic at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

We did not observe any difference in frequency of MAIT cells between asymptomatic carriers and HAM/TSP patients. This is in contrast with what has been reported for iNKT cells, another subset of innate T cells, that were further reduced in HAM/TSP patients[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Our results reproduce what has been described in other chronic viral infections. A similar loss of MAIT cells with residual MAIT cells showing an activated phenotype and loss of PLZF expression has been described in HIV and HCV infections[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. None of the MAIT cells alterations that we report here were associated with the HTLV-1 proviral load and MAIT cells were not found to be infected by HTLV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rather, MAIT cell loss was found to be associated with their activation status. Thus, our results suggest that the inflammatory state induced by HTLV-1 infection could be responsible for the MAIT cell loss. Recently, MAIT cells have been reported to respond to virus-infected cells in a TCR-independent way[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Virus-induced MAIT cell activation was dependent on the IL-18 pathway and could synergize with IL-12, IL-15 and IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. Little is known regarding IL-18 levels in HTLV-1 infection but polymorphisms in the IL-18 promoter have been associated with susceptibility to infection[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. IL-12 secretion by neutrophils was found to be elevated in asymptomatic and symptomatic HTLV-1 carriers[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. IL-12 was also found to be elevated in HTLV-1 patients with periodontitis compared with patients with periodontitis only[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and in HTLV-1 patients with HAM/TSP compared to uninfected patients with neurological diseases[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A type I interferon-induced gene signature has been identified in individuals with HAM/TSP but abnormal plasma levels of type I or type II IFNs haven&#x02019;t been detected in those patients, probably because of the short half-lives of IFNs[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Elevated levels of IL-12, IL-18, and IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; in HTLV-1 infection could explain the activated MAIT cell phenotype that we observed. Chronic <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation could also lead to exhaustion and explain the poor <italic>in vitro</italic> IFN&#x003b3; response following <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> stimulation that we observed.</p><p>HTLV-1-infected subjects have about a 3-fold increased susceptibility to Mtb than non-infected individuals, irrespective of their HIV status[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, there was no difference in the Mtb clinical outcome between HTLV-1-infected individuals and controls[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggesting that early innate response against Mtb is defective in HTLV-1 infection. MAIT cells are capable of recognizing Mtb-infected cells[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and MAIT cells have been shown in a mice model to contribute to the early protection against Mtb infection[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MAIT cells have also been shown to respond to both Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination and Mtb infection in a non-human primate model[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, the reduced frequency and functionality of MAIT cells that we observed in HTLV-1-infected subject could contribute to their increased susceptibility to Mtb. It would be important to determine if lung-resident MAIT cells are also decreased and functionally impaired in HTLV-1 infection. Elevated levels of IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; is a known correlate of risk progression for Mtb[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175345.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition to modulating phagocytes[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; could contribute to the increased susceptibility to Mtb of HTLV-1 patients by acting on MAIT cells[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In MS, MAIT cells have been postulated to be recruited from the blood to the CNS where they could be activated via a MR1 and IL-18 dependent pathway and contribute to the pathology[<xref rid="pone.0175345.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The reduced frequency of circulating MAIT cells in HTLV-1-infected subjects and their high level of immune activation could be consistent with recruitment to the CNS. However, we did not observe differences in MAIT cells frequency and activation between asymptomatic carriers and HAM/TSP patients. More studies looking at recruitment of MAIT cells to the CNS are needed to determine the contribution of MAIT cells to HAM/TSP. Other limitations of our study are that it is not possible to determine if MAIT cells are reduced because of recruitment to tissues or of a permanent loss and the polyfunctionality of the residual MAIT cells, including killing capacity, was not addressed.</p><p>Altogether, our results suggest that chronic inflammation in HTLV-1 infection leads to activation and loss of MAIT cells. Our results also argue against a role for MAIT in development of neurological symptoms in a subset of infected individuals but could partially explain their higher susceptibility to Mtb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175345.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>CD38 and HLA-DR co-expression in HTLV-1 infection.</title><p>Representative flow plots of CD38 and HLA-DR co-expression for CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and MAIT cells in healthy controls and HTLV-1-infected individuals.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175345.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175345.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>PD-1 expression in HTLV-1 infection.</title><p>Representative flow plots showing PD-1 expression by MAIT cells (CD3+, V&#x003b1;7.2+, CD161+) from healthy controls and HTLV-1-infected subjects (A).
