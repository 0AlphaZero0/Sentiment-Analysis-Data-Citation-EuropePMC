<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) has been responsible for an estimated one billion deaths worldwide over the last 200&#x02009;years (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which is more than any other infectious disease caused by a single pathogen. Given its global magnitude, it has been hypothesized that TB particularly contributed to the genetic selective pressure that predisposes for development of autoimmune diseases (AID) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This is supported by polymorphism studies of the <italic>TNF</italic> gene, which show an opposite association between susceptibility to TB vs. susceptibility to several AID (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, a gender-dependent predisposition to either TB or AID exists with a male predominance among TB patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) opposed to increased AID incidences in women (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The general concept of an inverse relation between infectious diseases and AID is best described by the hygiene hypothesis, which states that diminished exposure to infectious pathogens during childhood increases the chances of developing AID and allergies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Also, epidemiologically, the decline in burden of infectious diseases over the last century in industrialized countries is accompanied by increasing rates of AID (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Despite support for an inverse relation, similarities between TB and AID have also been identified. TB is even hypothesized to be an infection-induced AID based on the observation that diverse clinical autoimmune phenomena frequently occur in TB patients (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, up to 32% of patients with active TB have elevated autoantibody titers (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Rational explanations for these findings could be that either TB or AID activate common immunological pathways (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), or protective immunity in TB increases the chance to develop AID (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In both scenarios, key findings in AID immunology could potentially contribute to our understanding of TB pathogenesis.</p><p>The current paradigm of the host response to Mtb infection is summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The indispensable role of IL-12/IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated Th1 immunity against Mtb has long been recognized (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, stimulating Th1 immunity in TB can also result in excessive inflammation (see Box <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX1">1</xref>). More recently, the contributions of additional immune pathways have been explored, especially the role of type I interferons (T1-IFNs), Th17 immunity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and unconventional T cell immunity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Little is known about the potential interaction between T1-IFNs and Th17 responses in TB, but interesting observations in this regard have been reported for multiple AID (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To determine if these findings are relevant for the understanding of TB pathogenesis, we first review the separate involvements of T1-IFNs and Th17 responses in TB pathogenesis in Sections <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">3</xref>, respectively. Next, their known interactions in AID are discussed in Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">4</xref>. Finally, in Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">5</xref>, the potential relevance of these interacting pathways in TB is assessed and integrated into the current understanding of TB pathogenesis.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The phases and cell types involved in the immune response to tuberculosis (TB) in the lungs</bold>. (1) Inhaled Mtb-containing aerosols are deposited deep into the lung, reaching the alveoli (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Within the alveoli, Mtb are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (Alv. M&#x003a6;) or infect alveolar epithelial cells prior to ending up in alveolar macrophages (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Within Alv. M&#x003a6;, the bacteria are able to inhibit phagosome&#x02013;lysosome fusion and replicate until cell lysis ensues, which takes approximately 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;days (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). (2) After the initial contact, Mtb encounters infiltrating myeloid cells of which inflammatory dendritic cells and PMN are most readily infected (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). During these early phases, invariate natural killer (iNK) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1) produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to IL-12 and stimulate myeloid cells to kill phagocytosed Mtb. In addition, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells and ILC3 produce IL-17. There is increasing appreciation for the role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and their associated germinal centers (GC) that arise under influence of IL-17 and facilitate optimal activation of myeloid cells and efficient recall responses. During this process, loosely aggregated &#x0201c;innate granulomas&#x0201d; are already formed (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It should be noted that the roles of ILC1s and ILC3s are based on their general function, which has not yet been formally demonstrated in TB (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). (3) Onset of adaptive immunity in Mtb infection is delayed to <italic>circa</italic> 14&#x02009;days in mice and up to 6&#x02009;weeks in humans (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). At this point, distinct T-cell subsets and B-cells migrate to the site of infection and execute their different effector functions. (4) After onset of adaptive immunity, 90&#x02013;97% of infected individuals develop sustained infection without clinical symptoms termed &#x0201c;latent TB infection&#x0201d; (LTBI) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). LTBI was initially considered a static phase, but it is now known that this stage is hallmarked by the presence of granulomas in various stages (caseous, non-caseous, and fibrotic) and an ongoing balance between antimycobacterial activity and regulatory mechanisms to minimize immunopathology (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Cell phenotypes are as present in mouse TB models.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-08-00294-g001"/></fig><boxed-text position="float" id="BX1"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>The dual faces of IFN-&#x003b3; in tuberculosis (TB) immunity.</title></caption><p>In the current paradigm of a successful host response, lung DCs migrate to the draining lymph node after Mtb contact and induce a robust IL-12-mediated Th1 response (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This results in migration of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells to the site of infection. Subsequently, activation of macrophages by IFN-&#x003b3; results in killing of intracellular Mtb, while activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells lyse infected host cells. Conversely, unsuccessful clearance of infection is due to poor activation of adaptive immunity. This can result from insufficient antigen presentation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), or from the action of regulatory factors that interfere with Th1 responses such as IL-10 or PDL1-PD1 interaction (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Paradoxically, the current vaccine bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) induces a strong Th1 response but is only partially effective in protecting against TB (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Boosting the Th1-inducing potential of BCG by using a modified Ankara virus also has yielded disappointing results (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, solely stimulating Th1 immunity might not be the solution in TB prevention. This is confirmed in a mouse TB study showing that increasing IFN-&#x003b3; production by T-cells in the lungs is detrimental to the host due to hyper-inflammation that requires PD-1-mediated suppression to limit pathology (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In line with this, Mtb-infected mice deficient in PD-1, or mice in which PD-1 is selectively inhibited, display excessive inflammation and disease progression (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Finally, <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies in human monocyte-derived macrophages show that protective effects of IFN-&#x003b3; are dependent on multiple factors including time of contact, concentration, and the magnitude of the ensuing microbial challenge (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Based on these observations, it can be concluded that boosting IFN-&#x003b3; production and Th1 immunity in TB, besides potentially enhancing protection, can also result in unbalanced inflammation in the lungs that is more harmful to the host than to the pathogen. This emphasizes the need for involvement of additional immunological pathways for optimal protection.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2</label><title>T1-IFNs in TB</title><p>Type I interferons comprise a family of 13 IFN-&#x003b1; subtypes, IFN-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b5;, IFN-&#x003ba;, and IFN-&#x003c9;, which have the shared ability to bind to the IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor (IFNAR) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Other interferons include the single type II interferon, interferon-&#x003b3;, and the type III interferon family covering three IFN-&#x003bb; types.</p><p>All nucleated cell types are capable of both producing T1-IFNs and responding to them, while type II/III interferons are mostly produced by leukocytes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The main function of T1-IFNs is to &#x0201c;interfere&#x0201d; with intracellular infections. Therefore, T1-IFN expression is primarily induced through cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs), which activate distinct interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) that act as transcription factors enabling expression of interferon-responsive genes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In contrast, extracellular pathogens trigger surface-bound TLRs that preferentially induce IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; through activation of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>The role of T1-IFNs in infectious diseases is complex (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). T1-IFNs boost the immune system upon pathogen encounter by activating dendritic cells and NK cells and by stimulating both B-cell responses and CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. However, T1-IFNs can also induce anti-inflammatory responses to control immune-mediated tissue damage during chronic infections. These contradictory effects of T1-IFNs in different situations can likely be ascribed to the heterogeneity of the T1-IFNs family, downstream activation of different STAT homo/heterodimers after binding to IFNAR (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and to differential priming of cells prior to induction of T1-IFN signaling (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><sec id="S2-1"><label>2.1</label><title>T1-IFNs in Human TB</title><p>When recombinant or purified T1-IFNs became available as therapeutic agents in the 1980s, different applications have been established based on their antiviral, immune-stimulating, and suppressive effects. These include treatment of viral infections (e.g., IFN-&#x003b1; treatment of hepatitis B/C infections), AID [e.g., IFN-&#x003b2; treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS)], and various malignancies (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Based on their well-described immune-stimulating effect, the use of T1-IFNs as adjuvant to antibiotic treatment for patients with active TB has also been explored (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All studies found a positive influence of adjuvant T1-IFN therapy on clinical outcomes in active TB (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).

While reactivation of latent TB and treatment of active TB are two distinct clinical situations, the latter finding suggests an unfavorable role for T1-IFNs in TB pathogenesis.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of type I interferons supplementation in human tuberculosis (TB)</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regimen</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Side effects</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Open parallel, susceptible Mtb strain, HIV (&#x02212;), <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10), 2&#x02009;months treated</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="4" colspan="1">HRZE vs. HRZE&#x02009;+&#x02009;IFN-&#x003b1;</td><td align="left" valign="top" style="color:#1FAF50;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013; Less fever on days 3 and 4 after start treatment in HRZE&#x02009;+&#x02009;IFN-&#x003b1; group</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="4" colspan="1">No adverse effects reported</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Giosue et al.

The mycobacterial ESAT-6 secretion system (ESX-1) and its 6&#x02009;kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) are essential in this process, as mycobacteria lacking ESX-1 fail to induce T1-IFN production (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). ESAT-6 can disrupt the phagosomal membrane, which allows translocation of mycobacteria and mycobacterial products from the phagosome into the cytosol (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>).</p><p>Mycobacteria actively secrete several T1-IFN-inducing compounds, including double-stranded (ds)DNA and the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-AMP (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). These compounds are recognized by different cytosolic PRRs, including cGAS (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), IFI-204 (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>), AIM2 (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>), and possibly NOD2 (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>), although data on the latter are conflicting (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Activation of these cytosolic PRRs converges to activate &#x0201c;STimulator of INterferon Genes&#x0201d; (STING), which subsequently forms a complex with TANK-binding kinase 1 (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). This STING&#x02013;TBK1 complex activates IRF3, leading to IFN-&#x003b2; production in mice (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) as well as human dendritic cells (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). IRF3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are poor producers of IFN-&#x003b2; and more resistant to Mtb infection, which supports a negative role for T1-IFNs in TB pathogenesis (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>).</p><p>However, the overall picture is more complex. IRF3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are more resistant to Mtb infection, but mice deficient in the cytosolic PRR cGAS, upstream of IRF3, show diminished control of chronic Mtb infection (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). This can be traced back to a concomitant reduction in autophagy, which is also dependent on the cGAS-induced activation of the STING&#x02013;TBK1 axis, but independent of IRF3. In line with this, mice infected with an Mtb strain that induces higher amounts of cyclic-di-AMP, thus stimulating both IRF3-mediated IFN-&#x003b2; production and STING&#x02013;TBK1-mediated autophagy, show improved survival despite increased IFN-&#x003b2; levels (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that pro-mycobacterial effects of stimulating the cytosolic PRR/STING/IRF3/IFN-&#x003b2; axis by mycobacteria might be outweighed by the antimycobacterial effects of the PRR/STING/autophagy pathway.</p><p>Autocrine or paracrine IFN-&#x003b2;-signaling induces IRF7 and leads to the production of IFN-&#x003b1; in human dendritic cells (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). In line with this, injection of recombinant IFN-&#x003b2; in mice induces IFN-&#x003b1; production (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Alternatively, myeloid cells and particularly plasmacytoid dendritic (pDC) cells are capable of directly activating IRF7-mediated IFN-&#x003b1; production after recognition of Mtb, particularly by endosomal TLR9 (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). In TB, this TLR9-IRF7 pathway is studied to lesser extent than the cytosolic PRR&#x02013;IRF3 axis (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). This is possibly due to the dependence of T1-IFN-mediated pathogenic effects in mice on ESX-1, which induces IRF3 rather than IRF7 as explained above (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). However, IRF7 is recognized as commonly induced transcription factor by multiple clinical Mtb strains in alveolar epithelial cells (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Moreover, TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice succumb earlier to high-dose Mtb infection than wild-type mice, which suggests a role for the TLR9/IRF7/IFN-&#x003b1; axis in TB as well (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><label>2.4</label><title>T1-IFNs Drive the Influx of Mtb-Permissive Myeloid Cells during Acute Infection</title><p>Most studies in mouse TB models found significant functional effects of T1-IFNs specifically on CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>int</sup> myeloid cell populations (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>).

Several lines of evidence suggest that T1-IFNs regulate the influx of these cells and play a role in their functional impairment to resist Mtb. This interference with protective immunity is multifaceted and concerns four important interactions, which will be reviewed separately: (1) T1-IFNs mediate the influx of iM and iDC. (2) T1-IFNs inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; responses by these cells, which are essential in the initial host responses to Mtb. (3) Prolonged IL-1&#x003b2; signaling can also cause excessive inflammation and thus requires regulation during later phases. This can be mediated by T1-IFNs but also by IFN-&#x003b3; through functionally different routes. (4) T1-IFNs and IFN-&#x003b3; show a complex interplay in the activation of iM and iDC.</p><sec id="S2-4-1"><label>2.4.1</label><title>T1-IFNs Mediate the Influx of iM and iDC</title><p>Mtb-infected mice treated with the T1-IFN-inducing compound poly-ICLC show increased numbers of iM and iDC in the lungs, which are 10 times more permissive to Mtb infection than their counterparts in PBS-treated mice (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Others confirmed that signaling through IFNAR indeed augments the recruitment of Mtb-permissive iM and iDC into the lungs (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Mechanistically, IFNAR-dependent expression of the chemokine CCL2 mediates the influx of CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes that differentiate into iM and iDC (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Both myeloid and parenchymal cells can produce CCL2 in response to T1-IFNs, but parenchymal cells appear the main source of this chemokine (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>).

IL-1&#x003b2; augments TNF-&#x003b1;-stimulated Mtb killing and increases prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production by upregulating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2/PTGS2) (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>).

The anti-inflammatory effects of prostaglandin synthase (COX-) inhibitors such as NSAIDs underline this notion. However, high levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> can also exert immunosuppressive effects as they stimulate alternative activation of macrophages (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>), inhibit bactericidal activity (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>), and promote production of IL-10 (<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>).

Experimentally, one mouse study showed that low PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in the acute phase of infection are essential for iNOS-mediated control of Mtb (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). Also, PGE<sub>2</sub> plays an important role during acute TB since the PGE<sub>2</sub>-producing enzyme COX2 competes for arachidonic acid substrate with 5-lipoxygenase, which produces leukotrienes and lipoxins. Hereby, PGE<sub>2</sub> prevents necrotic cell death thus benefiting the host (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Opposed to the protective role of low PGE<sub>2</sub> levels during acute disease, PGE<sub>2</sub> levels are higher during the chronic phase of TB, and these concentrations contribute to disease by suppressing IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and iNOS (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). Notably, the cellular source of PGE<sub>2</sub> appears to differ between acute and chronic TB.

T1-IFNs and IFN-&#x003b3; can both reduce pro-IL-1&#x003b2; gene expression and increase the expression of soluble antagonists for the IL-1 receptor (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>, <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>).</p><p>Despite the abovementioned functional similarities between T1-IFNs and IFN-&#x003b3; in IL-1&#x003b2; inhibition, mechanistic differences exist between these IFN types in mediating this effect.</p><p><italic>Ex vivo</italic> studies in human iM and iDC demonstrate that IFN-&#x003b2; inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; production more potently than IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). One explanation might be that IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits IL-10, while T1-IFNs induce IL-10, which contributes to the inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>, <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Additionally, an IL-10-independent inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; by T1-IFNs was recently identified (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). T1-IFNs induce cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, which potently reduces IL-1&#x003b2; transcription and broadly represses IL-1-activating inflammasomes. In contrast, IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; by increasing intracellular nitric oxide in an iNOS-dependent way (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). This prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cleavage of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; into IL-1&#x003b2;. In contrast to the mechanisms exerted by T1-IFNs, IFN-&#x003b3;-induced iNOS not only limits IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated inflammation but also markedly enhances the bactericidal potential of iM (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). Conversely, T1-IFNs suppress iNOS production (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Based on the stimulation of iNOS by IFN-&#x003b3; and the inhibition of iNOS by T1-IFNs, it appears that iDC are more sensitive to T1-IFN signaling and iM to IFN-&#x003b3; when both types of interferon are present. T1-IFN-mediated inhibition of iNOS appears to occur primarily in iDC, since iDC only expressed iNOS in IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during viral infection, while iM appear more sensitive to IFN-&#x003b3; and are the main source of iNOS in wild-type mice (<xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>).</p><p>When taken together, these data suggest that IL-1&#x003b2; inhibition by either T1-IFNs or IFN-&#x003b3; has strong implications on the bactericidal potential of iM and iDC. Furthermore, T1-IFNs interfere with the induction of iNOS by IFN-&#x003b3;, particularly in iDC. This fits the observation that IFN-&#x003b3; only inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; production by iM but not iDC in mouse TB models (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Notably, iDC are the most readily infected cells in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and are present in larger numbers than iM during Mtb infection (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2-4-4"><label>2.4.4</label><title>The Interplay between T1-IFNs and IFN-&#x003b3;</title><p>During direct contact with Mtb through TLRs, endogenous T1-IFN signaling through IRF3 promotes IL-12 production by iDC over IL-23 (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Box <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>).

However, exogeneous T1-IFNs or T1-IFN signaling in the absence of TLR stimulation can also inhibit IL-12 production by iDC (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>, <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). This inhibition of IL-12 by T1-IFNs occurs particularly through induction of IL-10 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). T1-IFNs also inhibit the responsiveness of iDC to IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated activation, which is required for Mtb killing.

Both IL-12 and IL-23 are produced in particular by stimulated dendritic cells and to lesser degree by macrophages. The preferential production of IL-12 or IL-23 by these cells is multifactorial. Increased levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> support IL-23 production over IL-12 (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>). Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 also stimulates IL-23 production over IL-12, especially when NOD2 is simultaneously activated (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>, <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>).

In line with this, T1-IFN-mediated IRF3 activation and IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated IRF-1-activation both favor IL-12 production (<xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>, <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>).</p><p>IL-4 also favors IL-12 production and inhibits IL-23 production, especially in combination with IFN-&#x003b3; or GM-CSF (<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>, <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). Finally, an important pathway that promotes IL-12 over IL-23 is ligation of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 by CD40L on activated T-cells or by agonist antibodies (<xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). Taken together, IL-23 is induced in the presence of pathogens and innate signaling in the acute phase of infection, while onset of adaptive immunity with increased levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and/or IL-4 shifts the balance toward IL-12 (<xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>).</p></boxed-text><p>Recent findings might explain the mechanism behind this paradox where T1-IFNs initially support IL-12-mediated IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells but can also induce an IL-10<sup>high</sup> phenotype in iDC, which interferes with IL-12 production and prevents IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated activation. It has been observed in different mouse models, including Mtb-infected mice, that T1-IFNs can only induce an IL-10<sup>high</sup> regulatory phenotype in monocyte-derived DCs (iregDC) if these cells have been primed previously by IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3;-primed DCs that did not receive T1-IFN signaling differentiated into iDC that stimulated robust T-cell responses. This phenomenon of monocyte priming by IFN-&#x003b3; has been demonstrated to occur in the bone marrow (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). During gut infections, local production of IL-12 in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue stimulates bone-marrow-resident NK cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; as early as 3&#x02009;days post infection (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). This results in a uniform presence of an IFN-&#x003b3;-primed signature of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in the circulation at day 6. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3; indeed primed these monocytes toward a regulatory phenotype, as they more effectively produced IL-10 in response to bacterial ligands (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). We speculate that a similar mechanism of IFN-&#x003b3; priming is likely to be involved in pulmonary infections.</p><p>These data suggest interplay between T1-IFNs and IFN-&#x003b3; as proposed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.

(1) T1-IFN induces migration of CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes (iMo) from the bone marrow to the lungs of Mtb-infected mice under influence of CCL2 (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>).

(2) As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, na&#x000ef;ve iM and iDC can initiate either IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated inflammation or T1-IFN-mediated inflammation. Mtb actively triggers intracellular pattern recognition receptors to induce a T1-IFN-mediated response. (3) Additionally, iM and iDC in the na&#x000ef;ve situation have differentiated under influence of M-CSF, which makes them more responsive to T1-IFN signaling (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>).

(4) Similar to the situation in gut infection, we propose that in tuberculosis (TB) IL-12 production in the lungs stimulates IFN-&#x003b3; production by bone-marrow-resident NK cells, which locally primes monocytes (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; priming of monocyte-derived iDC is necessary for T1-IFNs to induce a regulatory (iregDC) phenotype in iDC in the lungs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).

This chemokine stimulates the influx of TLS-associated CXCR5<sup>+</sup> follicular helper (T<sub>fh</sub>)-cell, which facilitate optimal localization of effector T-cell populations within the lung parenchyma, thereby promoting efficient T-cell-dependent macrophage activation and intracellular Mtb killing (<xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>, <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The IL-23/IL-17 axis in acute tuberculosis</bold>. (1) When inflammatory dendritic cells (iDC) recognize Mtb through membrane-bound toll-like receptors, they can secrete IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-23, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This occurs more efficiently if iDC are activated through contact with Mtb-infected PMN, which also stimulates their migratory capacity to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and promotes recall immunity (<xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>).

(3) Activation of parenchymal cells by IL-17 in combination with IL-1&#x003b2; or other inflammatory mediators ultimately results in PMN influx. (4) PMN contribute to inflammation when stimulated by extracellular Mtb or inflammatory cytokines. (5) Activated PMN readily cause tissue damage through production of ROS and proteases; this effect is suppressed by activated iDC in a PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent way (<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>, <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>).

This promotes TLS formation and follicular helper T-cell migration to the site of infection. (7) CD40 ligation in the interaction between (i)DC and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells is a strong stimulus for IL-12 production over IL-23 (Box <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX3">3</xref>) and leads to Th1 formation and IFN-&#x003b3; production.

(9) In the absence of inflammatory stimuli, PMN can produce IL-10 and undergo apoptosis. Phagocytosis of apoptotic PMN induces an IL-10-producing regulatory M2c phenotype in macrophages and further contributes to resolution of inflammation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-08-00294-g004"/></fig><p>On account of their ability to induce TLS formation, boosting IL-23 and IL-17 production is also an interesting strategy for vaccine-induced protection against TB. In this regard, IL-17 production by Th17&#x02009;cells during recall responses is indeed dependent on IL-23 and could reduce mycobacterial loads in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice (<xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>). Th17&#x02009;cells preferentially migrate to the lungs and are better contained in the lungs compared to Th1&#x02009;cells upon adoptive transfer to na&#x000ef;ve mice (<xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>, <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>). The developmental flexibility of Th17&#x02009;cells is illustrated in experiments where Mtb-antigen-primed Th17&#x02009;cells have been adoptively transferred to na&#x000ef;ve mice (<xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>). Initially, these Th17&#x02009;cells produce IL-17. However, upon recall immunity against Mtb, they primarily produce IFN-&#x003b3;, with or without IL-17. Paradoxically, the latter switch results in a less effective reduction in bacterial loads compared to IL-17-producing Th17&#x02009;cells that are adoptively transferred from IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>This tendency of Th17&#x02009;cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; instead of IL-17 during recall responses might explain the observation that IL-17 production during later phases of Mtb infection is dominated by &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells rather than CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>, <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>).</p><p>When taken together, initial shaping of the local inflammatory environment by IL-17 and IL-23 during acute infection stimulates local TLS formation.

Furthermore, Th17&#x02009;cells confer protective immunity during recall responses by their enhanced capacity to migrate to the lungs and stimulate T<sub>fh</sub> responses compared to other CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="S3-4"><label>3.4</label><title>The Th17 Response, PMN, and Inflammatory Damage</title><p>IL-17 stimulates granulopoiesis in the bone marrow and increases PMN influx to the site of infection by inducing G-CSF, CXCL1, CXCL3, and CXCL5 expression by parenchymal cells in mice or G-CSF and IL-8 in humans (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>). These effects of IL-17 are markedly enhanced through synergistic activation by inflammatory mediators such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, or GM-CSF (<xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>, <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>, <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>). In this regard, IL-17 is not a strong inducer of inflammation by itself, but rather amplifies preexisting inflammation. This IL-17-mediated &#x0201c;inflammatory boost&#x0201d; can positively shape adaptive immunity, but prolonged or repeated antigen exposure can also lead to PMN-mediated pathological inflammation (<xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>). Since IL-17 signaling is inevitably linked to PMN influx, the role of PMN in TB provides an additional perspective on the effects of IL-17 signaling in TB.</p><p>Review of available literature on the role of PMN in TB yields a complex picture with seemingly conflicting effects (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>, <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>). In patients with active TB, PMN are the predominantly infected cells in the airways and provide a permissive site for a burst of active mycobacterial replication prior to transmission (<xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>). On the other hand, PMN from healthy individuals, especially when stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1;, show a strong bactericidal effect (<xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>). In preclinical TB models, highly susceptible mouse strains such as I/St, CBA/J, or DBA/2 show an enhanced influx of apoptosis-resistant, highly phagocytic neutrophils that negatively affect survival compared to more TB-resistant C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (<xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>). Moreover, PMN are poor producers of essential cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and IL-12p40 in the anti-TB response (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>). These effects in preclinical models primarily suggest a negative contribution of PMN to acute disease. However, increasing evidence suggests a supportive role for PMN in protective immunity. PMN can indirectly augment IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages after contact with Mtb (<xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>, <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>, <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>). Also, and consistent with Th17 responses, PMN play an essential role in generation of protective recall responses in Mtb-infected mice (<xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>, <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>, <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>). Early, but not late PMN recruitment is essential for IL-17-mediated long-term control of Mtb infection (<xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>). This can be explained by the finding that DCs that acquire Mtb through uptake of infected PMN are better able to activate T-cells (<xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>, <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>). The importance of this mechanism is recently highlighted in Mtb-infected mice, showing that PMN-depletion during vaccination prevented the generation of specific Th1 and Th17 responses (<xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>).</p><p>A second emerging protective role of PMN is their contribution to initiating inflammation resolution (<xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>). In mouse TB models, PMN are the main producers of IL-10 in the lungs and can dampen inflammatory damage (<xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>). In this regulatory role, PMN inhibit Th17 responses but do not interfere with IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated Th1 immunity due to relative insensitivity of Th1&#x02009;cells to IL-10 (<xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>, <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>). Another regulatory effect of PMN concerns their apoptosis and subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages in the absence of extracellular Mtb. This inhibits IL-23 production by these macrophages and induces a regulatory IL-10<sup>high</sup> M2c phenotype under influence of IL-17 and IL-10 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) (<xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>, <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>). IL-17 can further contribute to this process by attenuating the anti-apoptotic effect of GM-CSF on PMN and by stimulating PMN apoptosis (<xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>, <xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, PMN recruitment to the site of infection is largely dependent on IL-17, but only in synergy with innate inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;. Locally, these recruited PMN contribute to inflammation if pathogens are still present, improve dendritic cell function, and contribute to the formation of recall responses, or initiate resolution of inflammation in the absence of inflammatory or microbial stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="S3-5"><label>3.5</label><title>Summary: The Role of Th17 Immunity in TB</title><p>The roles of IL-23 and IL-17 in TB are more subtle than the effects of Th1-related cytokines or T1-IFNs. Patient data are mostly limited to studies in PBMC. These show inconclusive results that are possibly confounded by the dynamics and heterogeneity of the Th17 response, which can range from highly pro-inflammatory IFN-&#x003b3;/GM-CSF-producing Th17.1 cells to IL-10-producing regulatory Th17&#x02009;cells.</p><p>Preclinical mouse TB models provide evidence for a protective role of the Th17 cytokines IL-23 and IL-17 in TB. These protective effects become apparent in the chronic phase of infection but result from IL-23/IL-17-mediated effects in the earlier, acute phase of infection. This is associated with early protective effects of IL-1&#x003b2;, which is a strong inducer of IL-23 and IL-17 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Mechanistically, evidence for the protective effects of IL-17 and IL-23 primarily points toward their role in the development of TLS during the acute phase of disease, which provides protective effects during later stages (<xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>, <xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>). Additionally, IL-23 and IL-17 induce CXCL13 expression that mediates the influx of TLS-associated T<sub>fh</sub> cells. TLS and T<sub>fh</sub> responses facilitate optimal interactions between adaptive and innate immunity, contribute to granuloma formation, and improve the quality of T-cell recall responses in TB (<xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>). In TB patients, TLS have also been associated with immune control, but more in-depth research is needed to establish their exact functional role and contribution to protective immunity (<xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>).</p><p>Next to TLS formation and function, IL-23 and IL-17 mediate the influx of PMN into the lungs and the contribution of these cells to protective immunity in TB is increasingly recognized (<xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>). Early, but not late PMN recruitment is essential for IL-17-mediated long-term control of Mtb infection (<xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>) and DCs that acquire Mtb through uptake of infected PMN are better able to activate T-cells than DCs that directly interact with Mtb themselves (<xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>, <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>). The ability of IL-17 to induce the production of PMN-attracting chemokines in parenchymal cells is markedly improved when IL-17 signals in synergy with inflammatory mediators such as IL-1&#x003b2;, which again indicates synergy between IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-17 responses during acute TB. Prolonged activation of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-17 responses can lead to massive accumulation of PMN, and their local necrotic death can also be damaging to the host. However, in the absence of inflammatory stimuli, PMN are an important source of IL-10 in the lungs and can initiate resolution of inflammation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><label>4</label><title>T1-IFNs, the Th17 Response and Their Interactions in Autoimmune Disease</title><p>Autoimmune diseases comprise a wide range of organ-specific and systemic disorders. Most systemic AID are considered classical B cell-mediated diseases, typified by circulating autoreactive antibodies against intracellular self-antigens. The clinical presentation of different AID varies, but evidence from genome-wide association studies points toward common immunogenetic mechanisms, as many systemic AID share disease-associated genes (<xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>). Another trait particularly shared amongst different antibody-driven AID is the expression of a T1-IFN signature in both blood- and disease-affected tissue (<xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>), the strength of which generally correlates with disease activity and severity (<xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>). <italic>Vice versa</italic>, T1-IFN immunotherapy as treatment for other diseases is known to cause symptoms similar to those observed in AID, such as development of psoriatic lesions in MS or hepatitis C-infected patients (<xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>, <xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>).</p><p>T-cells also have a major impact on the development and progression of AID and increasing evidence points toward crucial involvement of the Th17 response in the pathogenesis of multiple AID (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>, <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>). Th17&#x02009;cells have been shown to be critical in the pathogenesis of MS and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>). However, Th17&#x02009;cells have also been associated with disease severity in AID characterized by a T1-IFN signature, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B233" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>, <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>, <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>). Since T1-IFN signatures and Th17 responses are both associated with disease in AID, the question arises whether these two pathways act in concert to sustain and amplify autoimmune responses, or control each other (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>). Therefore, we will discuss below the involvement of the T1-IFN and Th17 responses in AID individually as well as their interaction. We refer readers who are familiar with the contributions of T1-IFN and Th17 in AID to continue at Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4-3">4.3</xref> where we discuss the interaction between these pathways.</p><sec id="S4-1"><label>4.1</label><title>The Contribution of T1-IFNs to the Pathogenesis of AID</title><p>Most insight into the role of T1-IFNs in the pathogenesis of AID has been obtained in SLE, which was the first disease in which a T1-IFN transcriptional signature was identified in 2003 (<xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>). Since then it has become clear that 60&#x02013;80% of adult SLE patients and nearly 100% of pediatric SLE patients express a T1-IFN signature in their blood (<xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>). Several mechanisms through which T1-IFNs contribute to disease in SLE, outlined below, have been elucidated.</p><sec id="S4-1-1"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Induction of T1-IFNs in AID</title><p>Specifically IFN-&#x003b1; appears to play a central role in SLE pathogenesis (<xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>, <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>). As mentioned in Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2-3">2.3</xref> IFN-&#x003b1; is produced in an IRF7-dependent way by pDC and other myeloid cell types. In accordance, pDC have been found to be a major source of T1-IFNs in SLE (<xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>, <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>). Immune complexes (IC), consisting of antibodies bound to self-DNA, are a major trigger for IFN-&#x003b1; production by pDC in AID (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>). However, pDC are not activated by self-DNA under steady state conditions, which indicates that additional stimuli are required. One such stimulus is the PMN-derived antimicrobial peptide LL37 (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>), which convert inert self-DNA into a potent activator of endosomal TLR9 (<xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>). Another stimulus is the nuclear protein high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, which is secreted by activated myeloid cells and passively released by necrotic, but not apoptotic cells (<xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>). HMGB1 binds DNA, and the formed complexes bind with high affinity to receptor for advanced glycation end-products, which facilitates internalization into the endosome where TLR9 can be activated (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>). Extracellular HMGB1 also triggers the recruitment of PMN and stimulates their formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>). NETs contain large amounts of nucleic acids and LL37 and are also a major driving factor behind chronic pDC activation and IFN-&#x003b1; production in SLE (<xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>).</p><p>It deserves mention that NET formation is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in PMN are particularly produced by NADPH oxidase and subsequently processed by myeloperoxidase (<xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>). Paradoxically, despite the capacity of NETs to induce T1-IFNs and the pathogenic role of T1-IFNs in SLE, NADPH oxidase appears to be protective in SLE (<xref rid="B255" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>). Lupus-prone mice deficient in NADPH-oxidase develop more severe SLE (<xref rid="B255" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>). Moreover, autoimmunity with T1-IFN signatures can still develop in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease, who lack NADPH-oxidase activity (<xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>). This seeming contradiction has been partially explained by the observation that IgG autoantibody-mediated NETosis, which is most relevant in SLE, is specifically reliant on mitochondrial ROS, while NETosis induced by, e.g., TLR4 signaling is NADPH dependent (<xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>). In line with this, NETs from SLE patients have been shown to contain mitochondrial DNA (<xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>). Thus, the way NETs are induced, and the type of DNA that is present on NETs probably also influences their ability to induce T1-IFNs and their role in disease.</p><p>Taken together, TLR9-mediated IFN-&#x003b1; production by pDC in response to IC and NETs appears the major driving factor behind T1-IFN production in autoantibody-mediated AID.

In monocyte-derived cells, T1-IFNs stimulate maturation, increase phagocytic capacities (<xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>), and increase the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (<xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>). Also, T1-IFNs have a direct stimulating effect on T-cells. Together, these effects promote the generation of autoreactive T-cells, which support autoreactive B-cell responses (<xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>, <xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>).</p><p>At cytokine level, T1-IFNs can induce the production of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) by myeloid cells (<xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>, <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>, <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>). BAFF induction confers a significant proportion of T1-IFN-mediated damage in SLE as supported by the observation that IFN-&#x003b1; administration induces disease in SLE-prone mice but fails to do so in B-cell-deficient and BAFF-deficient mice on the same background (<xref rid="B262" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>). BAFF plays a central role in the development and selection of autoreactive B-cells (<xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>). In line with this, increased BAFF expression correlates with disease severity in SLE (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>, <xref rid="B263" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>). BAFF also induces class switch recombination in B-cells, leading to preferential expression of IgG and IgA over IgM, which is important for Fc-receptor-mediated NETosis induction in PMN (<xref rid="B264" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>). The clinical relevance of BAFF in SLE pathogenesis is illustrated by the current use of belimumab, a monoclonal antibody against BAFF, as treatment for SLE (<xref rid="B265" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>). Interestingly, targeting BAFF is effective in SLE patients, while B-cell depleting therapies using CD-20-targeting rituximab show disappointing results in phase III clinical trials (<xref rid="B266" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>, <xref rid="B267" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>). This suggests effector functions of BAFF other than B-cell activation. In this regard, BAFF can act as a co-stimulatory molecule for T-cells and promote Th17 development (<xref rid="B268" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>, <xref rid="B269" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>). BAFF can also directly activate plasma cells, which are not depleted by rituximab (<xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>, <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4-2"><label>4.2</label><title>The Contribution of Th17 in the Pathogenesis of AID</title><sec id="S4-2-1"><label>4.2.1</label><title>GM-CSF-Secreting Th17.1 Cells</title><p>Pathogenic effects of Th17-mediated immunity in AID have been studied most detailed in MS and RA and their respective mouse models, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), and collagen-induced arthritis (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>, <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>). MS was long believed to be primarily driven by an IL-12/Th1 response, but this concept was challenged by observations in the EAE mouse model for MS showing that the IL-23p19 subunit instead of IL-12p35 (see Box <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX3">3</xref>) caused disease (<xref rid="B272" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>). In addition, the classic cytokines of Th1 and Th17 immunity, i.e., IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17, respectively, were found dispensable in EAE and instead GM-CSF appeared to be the effector cytokine responsible for IL-23-induced encephalopathy (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). Notably, while most studies agree on a central pathogenic role for GM-CSF in MS, conflicting results are reported regarding its cellular source (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B273" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>). One study shows that GM-CSF expression in MS patients is promoted by the IL-12/T-bet/Th1 axis, instead of IL-23 as observed in mouse EAE (<xref rid="B273" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>). Other publications report that B-cells are a major source of GM-CSF and specifically act in concert with Th17&#x02009;cells (<xref rid="B274" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>, <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>). In accord with these discrepant results, MS is shown to be a heterogeneous disease that can be driven by either Th1 or Th17 immunity (<xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>), which also has implications for therapy as will be discussed in Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4-3-1">4.3.1</xref>.</p><p>One interesting observation in this regard is the development of &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d; Th17.1 cells that express markers of both Th17&#x02009;cells and Th1&#x02009;cells. Na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in both mice and man do not express the IL-23 receptor and can either differentiate into T-bet<sup>+</sup> Th1&#x02009;cells under influence of IL-12 or differentiate into CCR6<sup>+</sup> Th17&#x02009;cells under influence of IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>). These IL-6/TGF-&#x003b2;-differentiated Th17&#x02009;cells have low inflammatory potential and are prone to adopt an IL-10-producing regulatory phenotype. However, IL-6 also induces STAT3-dependent upregulation of IL-23 receptor (<xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). Subsequent (re)activation of such IL-6-primed Th17&#x02009;cells by IL-23 increases Th1-associated T-bet expression and generates inflammatory IFN-&#x003b3;/GM-CSF-producing Th17.1 cells (<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>).

Expression of CCR2 by Th17.1 cells can contribute to their inflammatory potential as it can divert their migration to sites without concomitant influx of regulatory T-cells, which depend on CCR6 for their migration (<xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, it was shown in a mouse EAE model that GM-CSF exerted its pathogenic effector function by stimulating IL-1&#x003b2; production by monocyte-derived cells (<xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>). This suggests a positive inflammatory feedback loop, since IL-1&#x003b2; in turn promotes IL-23 production and development of Th17.1 cells (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). A similar pathogenic Th17.1 response is observed in RA, which was the first AID in which IL-1&#x003b2; inhibition was approved for clinical use (<xref rid="B280" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>). Also, regarding the distinction between Th17 and Th17.1 responses in RA, it should be noted that anti-GM-CSF therapy shows more promise than anti-IL-17 in clinical phase I/II trials (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>, <xref rid="B281" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4-2-2"><label>4.2.2</label><title>The Contribution of IL-17-Producing Th17 Cells to AID Pathogenesis</title><p>Next to GM-CSF-secreting Th17.1 cells, regular IL-17-producing Th17&#x02009;cells also have been identified as pathogenic in other AID.

With the functional dichotomy of IL-1&#x003b2; and T1-IFNs in mind, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, MS and SLE seem to be opposite ends of the disease spectrum in AID instead of demonstrating interactions between T1-IFNs and the Th17 response. However, the existence of different Th17 subsets might explain this seeming disparity and suggest roles for GM-CSF-producing Th17.1 cells in MS and regular IL-17-producing Th17&#x02009;cells in SLE. Both Th17 responses interact differently with T1-IFNs as will be discussed here. We identify three relevant interactions: (1) Th17.1 responses are fueled by T1-IFN-stimulated influx of CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes; (2) a pathological IL-17/T1-IFN/BAFF axis driven by NET-forming PMN; and (3) Th17 immunity and T1-IFNs collaborate in the generation and function of TLS. An overview of these pathways is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Interactions between type I interferons (T1-IFNs) and Th17 immunity in autoimmune diseases</bold>. The color grading in the figure indicates the level of involvement of either Th17 immunity or T1-IFN-associated signaling. (1) T1-IFNs, primarily produced by plasmacytoid dendritic (pDC) but also by inflammatory dendritic cells (iDC) and PMN, prime the latter cells toward a T1-IFN/B-cell activating factor (BAFF)-producing phenotype, promote NETosis by PMN and stimulate monocyte migration by inducing CCL2 production. (2) BAFF activates B-cells, stimulates tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) formation together with CXCL13, directly promotes Th17 differentiation (not shown), and stimulates the release of IL-1&#x003b2; by iDC. (3) TLS facilitate optimal interaction between activated B-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC), while necrosis, neutrophil extracellular traps, and T1-IFN increase the chance that these APC present self-antigens. Subsequent germinal center (GC) reactions within these TLS result in B-cells differentiating into plasma cells that produce large quantities of autoantibodies. These autoantibodies can mediate tissue damage and sustain a self-amplifying loop by inducing NETosis through binding the Fc-receptor on PMN. B-cells can also contribute to Th17 immunity by their ability to secrete IL-6 and GM-CSF (not shown and uncertain if this is BAFF dependent). (4) NETs trap antibodies. This facilitates their Fc-receptor-mediated internalization by pDC in which they stimulate T1-IFN production through endosomal TLR9 activation. Circulating NETs also stimulate IL-1&#x003b2; production by iDC and can mediate tissue damage. (5) In a pro-inflammatory feedback loop, IL-23 stimulates the development of GM-CSF-producing Th17&#x02009;cells (Th17.1), which in turn, together with BAFF and/or NETs stimulate an inflammatory phenotype in iDC. (6) IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 stimulate IL-17 production by &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells, while concomitant stimulation with IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; is required for IL-17-induced G-CSF and chemokine production in parenchymal cells. (7) IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; activate PMN to release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases that cause tissue damage. Furthermore, GM-CSF increases longevity of PMN (not shown). Finally, the priming of PMN and monocytes prior to entering the site of disease is important for their eventual effector function. For monocytes this is shown in more detail in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-08-00294-g005"/></fig><sec id="S4-3-1"><label>4.3.1</label><title>T1-IFNs Can Contribute to Th17.1-Mediated AID</title><p>Among MS patients treated with IFN-&#x003b2;, approximately 30&#x02013;50% do not respond favorably to treatment (<xref rid="B284" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>).

This is one of the first studies that report a detrimental interaction between T1-IFNs and Th17 responses. Given the importance of Th17.1 cells in MS, this negative outcome might be explained by the observation that IFN-&#x003b2; therapy in MS increases CCL2 production (<xref rid="B285" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>). Expression of this chemokine in the brain recruits inflammatory CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes as well as Th17.1 cells, which switch their chemokine receptor profile from CCR6<sup>+</sup> to CCR2<sup>+</sup> upon terminal differentiation (<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>).

Inflammatory monocytes may differentiate locally into dendritic cells further stimulating Th17 responses (<xref rid="B287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>). Thus, a strongly pro-inflammatory condition is created in Th17.1-mediated MS. Since regulatory T lymphocytes rely on CCR6 rather than CCR2 (<xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>), recruitment of these anti-inflammatory cells does not appear to hold pace with the influx of inflammatory monocytes and Th17.1 cells in MS.</p></sec><sec id="S4-3-2"><label>4.3.2</label><title>A Pathological IL-17/T1-IFNs/BAFF Axis in AID</title><p>IL-17 induces PMN influx through induction of G-CSF and chemokines (see Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3-4">3.4</xref>), which contribute to the production of IFN-&#x003b1; by pDC <italic>via</italic> the NETosis process (see Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4-1-1">4.1.1</xref>). However, increasing evidence suggests a more prominent contribution of IL-17 and PMN to T1-IFN-mediated disease in SLE. First, besides being major inducers of IFN-&#x003b1; production by pDC upon NETosis, PMN also appear to be a significant source of IFN-&#x003b1; themselves (<xref rid="B288" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>, <xref rid="B289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>).

In accord, circulating PMN of SLE patients are also the main cells expressing the transcriptional T1-IFN signature and release more NETs than PMN from healthy individuals (<xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>, <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>, <xref rid="B288" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>, <xref rid="B289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>, <xref rid="B291" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>, <xref rid="B292" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>). Thirdly, T1-IFNs stimulate BAFF production, which is essential for T1-IFN-mediated pathogenic effects in mouse SLE (<xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>, <xref rid="B262" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>, <xref rid="B293" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>).

Also, therapeutically administered G-CSF, which is physiologically induced by IL-17, increases BAFF production by PMN (<xref rid="B294" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>).</p><p>These interactions indicate a prominent role for IL-17-mediated PMN influx in T1-IFN-production and induction in AID and synergistic induction of BAFF production by IL-17 and T1-IFNs.

Although the role of Th17.1 cells in TB is uncertain, other cells such as NK cells and Th1&#x02009;cells can also produce GM-CSF in TB, and during the course of infection, GM-CSF levels progressively increase in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>, <xref rid="B315" ref-type="bibr">315</xref>). The functional role of GM-CSF is of interest in TB, because it importantly impacts on CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which play a central role in T1-IFN-mediated pathogenic effects. T1-IFNs stimulate the influx of inflammatory CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes but inhibit their IL-1&#x003b2; production and stimulate their differentiation into Mtb-permissive cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, GM-CSF is protective during acute TB, which is in line with the protective effects of IL-1&#x003b2; in this phase of disease. Mice deficient in GM-CSF succumb rapidly to infection due to their inability to mount Th1 responses (<xref rid="B316" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>, <xref rid="B317" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>). Transgenic mice that overexpress GM-CSF in the lungs but are GM-CSF-deficient in all other organs can develop Th1 responses, but still succumb to infection more rapidly than wild-type mice due to their inability to develop a normal granulomatous response (<xref rid="B316" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>, <xref rid="B317" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>). Evidence from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggests that GM-CSF exerts its protective effect in TB by countering the effects of T1-IFNs in CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Under physiological conditions, monocytes differentiate under influence of M-CSF into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). These MDM have a CCR2<sup>low</sup> phenotype, readily produce CCL2 and IL-10 in response to T1-IFNs, and have a low Mtb-killing capacity (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>, <xref rid="B318" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>, <xref rid="B319" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>). Conversely, monocytes that differentiate under influence of GM-CSF (GMDM) are CCR2<sup>high</sup>, relatively unresponsive to T1-IFN signaling, produce small amounts of CCL2 and IL-10, and have better Mtb-killing capacities than MDM in response to activation by IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>).</p><p>The relative unresponsiveness of GMDM to T1-IFNs might explain why preclinical studies primarily show effects of T1-IFNs during acute TB when the GM-CSF/M-CSF ratio in the lungs is relatively low, but less pronounced effects during later stages when GM-CSF-levels progressively increase (see Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2-4-3">2.4.3</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). However, similar to IL-1&#x003b2;, prolonged GM-CSF signaling also appears detrimental in TB. In particular, GM-CSF contributes to foamy macrophage development during later stages of infection, which can sustain persistent mycobacteria and contribute to inflammation (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>, <xref rid="B320" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>).</p><p>In summary, relatively few data are available on Th17.1 cells or T-cell-derived GM-CSF in TB. The requirement for antigen stimulation of T-cells to induce expression of GM-CSF is interesting. However, elevated TGF-&#x003b2; levels in TB patients suggest a limited contribution of Th17.1 cells to disease, as TGF-&#x003b2; favors the development of regular IL-17-producing Th17&#x02009;cells. Regardless of its cellular source, preclinical TB studies support a protective role for GM-CSF during acute infection. GM-CSF causes monocytes to differentiate into cells with decreased T1-IFN responsiveness and increased Mtb-killing potential compared to their M-CSF-differentiated counterparts. However, during chronic Mtb infection, high GM-CSF levels appear detrimental as they stimulate foamy macrophage development and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S5-2"><label>5.2</label><title>The IL-17/T1-IFNs/BAFF Axis in TB</title><p>In the previous paragraph, it was discussed that regular IL-17-producing T-cells are more likely to play a role in TB than Th17.1 cells.

Recently, these different immunoregulatory roles of IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; in SLE and MS have been confirmed by more detailed analysis of blood transcriptional profiles in patients (<xref rid="B330" ref-type="bibr">330</xref>).

Taken together, little is known about the separate effects of IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; in TB, but clinical and preclinical studies support a role for both in different disease contexts.

Studies in TB patients show protective effects of antibody-mediated immunity but also elevated titers of autoantibodies.

IFN-&#x003b3; priming appears essential for the induction of an Mtb-permissive phenotype, and monocytes that differentiate under GM-CSF are less responsive to T1-IFNs than their M-CSF-differentiated counterparts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). The second aspect is the diversification of IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; responses on a transcriptional and functional level as explained in Box <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX4">4</xref>. We propose that the inflammatory effects of IRF7-mediated IFN-&#x003b1; might contribute to excessive innate inflammatory responses in TB, while the immunosuppressive effects of IFN-&#x003b2; are more likely to support mycobacterial persistence.</p><p>Determination of the role of the Th17 response in TB is impeded by its heterogeneity, reflected in the presence of different Th17 subsets with ranging inflammatory potentials. Observations in AID emphasize the difference between IFN-&#x003b3;/GM-CSF-producing Th17.1 cells and regular IL-17-producing Th17&#x02009;cells. The exact role of T-cell-derived GM-CSF in TB remains to be determined, but preclinical TB studies show a protective role for GM-CSF on monocyte differentiation in the acute phase of TB. In contrast, IL-17 and PMN appear more relevant in chronic control of Mtb infection and recall immunity.</p><p>Immunological similarities between TB and AID may result from commonly activated pathogenic pathways. Alternatively, compensatory mechanisms induced by one disease might predispose for the development of the other. Interactions between IL-17, T1-IFNs, and BAFF form a pathological axis in AID that promote autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity.</p><p>The newly appreciated functional roles of antibodies, B-cells, and T<sub>fh</sub> cells in TB provide suggestive evidence that pathogenic mechanisms in AID confer protective immunity to TB. Further, insight into these mechanisms as discussed in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> may generate leads for immune-directed therapies adjunct to current and newly developed antimicrobial treatment protocols.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in tuberculosis (TB)</bold>. TLS, Tfh cells, B-cells, and antibodies are all associated with protective immunity in TB. Preclinical TB models show that TLS induction and CXCL13 production are driven by IL-17 and IL-23. Type I interferons (T1-IFNs) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) support TLS function and Tfh responses in autoimmune diseases (AID). In TB, T1-IFNs and BAFF are associated with active disease, but their functional role remains to be identified. Dotted lines implicate mechanisms present in AID that have not been confirmed in TB. Outstanding question: (1) What are the functional roles of T1-IFNs and BAFF in TLS function and humoral immunity in Mtb infection?</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-08-00294-g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>BM has written the manuscript and drafted the figures; EL has written the initial version of Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">4</xref> and contributed to the conception of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; JS and TO have contributed substantially to Sections <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">5</xref> and the conception of Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; PL has contributed substantially to the design of the work, writing of the manuscript, conception of all figures, and final review of the manuscript.
