<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a global disease infected by various strains of mycobacteria, especially <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One third of the world&#x02019;s population is latently infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>; about 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic and up to 10% of infected individuals progress to active TB, which is characterized by a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the tuberculin skin test is the most common diagnostic test for the detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), it has a tendency to produce false-positive results due to the administration of BCG vaccine or other viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect changes in the expression of particular genes [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which allow discrimination of active TB from LTBI subjects, as well as helping distinguish healthy individuals from active TB and LTBI subjects.</p><p>Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) is a src homolog 2 (SH2) domain-containing polypeptide that was found to inhibit cytokine signaling through negative feedback [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since its discovery, it was found to possess numerous actions and was reported to constitute the SOCS protein family with other SH2 domain-containing and SOCS box-containing proteins, SOCS-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS)-1. For examples, SOCSs modulate immunity and inflammation and provide negative feedback to suppress cytokine [i.e., interleukin (IL)-1, -6 and interferon gamma] and hormone signaling [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated that SOCS-1 and -3 were higher in active TB patients than healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; the expression of SOCS-1 gene is associated with caseous necrosis in granulomas from patients with TB lymphadenitis [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite of this attention, no studies have demonstrated whether other SOCS family members closely associate with TB and whether their mRNA expression profiles differ from healthy subjects. No reports have found whether any of SOCS expression is different between LTBI and active TB patients living in Taiwan.</p><p>In this study, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to investigate the differences in the expression of SOCS genes among healthy individuals, LTBI subjects, and active TB patients in Taiwan. We showed that expressions of SOCS-2, -3, -4, -5, and CIS-1 mRNAs, but not SOCS-1, -6, or -7 mRNAs, were significantly different between healthy individuals and TB subjects, or between active TB and LTBI subjects. We also found that the mRNA expression profiles of particular members of the SOCS family varied with the gender and age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Clinical sample collection</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

LTBI subjects were recruited from close contact with active TB patients, with positive T-SPOT TB test and negative chest radiograph, but without clinical evidence of active TB. Healthy controls (HC) were individuals who had not been in close contact with TB or LTBI patients and showed no clinical signs of TB or LTBI. Individuals with allergic diseases, diabetes, cancer, immunocompromised conditions, and coinfections with any types of infectious diseases were excluded. In total, 35 healthy individuals (16 men and 19 women), 29 subjects with LTBI (12 men and 17 women), and 42 subjects with active TB (30 men and 12 women) were enrolled in this study.

Changes in the SOCS-2, -3, and -5 mRNA levels appeared to be beneficially used for better discrimination of active TB from healthy and LTBI subjects in males and females. A few studies indicated that sex hormones (e.g., androgen and estrogen) can regulate SOCS gene expression in prostate [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and breast [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] cancer cells.

Further studies are needed to determine whether the association of sex hormones with cytokines explains the gender-dependent differences of SOCS expression between healthy and TB subjects.</p><p>According to the report for Taiwan tuberculosis in 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the incidence of new TB cases was more than one-half (~52%) in aged subjects (&#x02265; 65 years old) to that of non-aged subjects (&#x0003c; 65 years old). Accordingly, we separated non-aged subjects from aged subjects to examine the possibility for the differences of SOCS gene expression between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176377.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Because the LTBI patients were mostly aged below 65 years old, they were excluded for the comparison. In non-aged subjects, active TB patients rather than healthy individuals had lower levels of SOCS-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and CIS-1 mRNAs, higher SOCS-3 mRNA levels, and no effects on SOCS-1 mRNA. In men but not in women, active TB patients had significantly higher SOCS-3 mRNA expression than healthy individuals. In aged subjects, active TB patients tended to reveal lower levels of SOCS-5 and CIS-1 mRNAs than healthy participants. Notably, none of the eight SOCS subfamilies had significant differences of their mRNA expression between aged and non-aged healthy subjects. No significant differences were found in levels of SOCS-1, -2, -3, and CIS-1 mRNA between aged and non-aged TB patients. However, SOCS-4, -5, -6, and -7 mRNA levels were significantly different between non-aged and aged TB patients. Taken together, the mRNA expression profiles of SOCS genes during different ages and gender in the healthy, LTBI and active TB subjects were presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176377.g004">Fig 4</xref>. These observations suggest that the mRNA expression profiles of particular SOCS subfamilies vary with the age in TB patients. SOCS-4, -5, -6, and -7 appear to allow us for discrimination of aged TB patients from non-aged TB patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176377.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A previous study [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] indicated that some genes (e.g., CDO1, HLA-B, CIS-1, IL-17) changed their expressions with age in the human kidney in association with kidney degeneration [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Increased levels of the immune-related genes, such as HLA-B, CIS-1, and IL-17, suggests that immune surveillance or inflammation increases with age.

distinguishing healthy individuals from TB subjects, or LTBI from active TB subjects. The present study not only details expressions of SOCS family members in Taiwanese TB population, but also provides certain understanding of differences of expression of particular SOCS mRNAs among healthy, LTBI and active TB subjects. Higher levels of SOCS-3 mRNA, but not SOCS-1, -6, or -7 mRNAs, in active TB patients than healthy and LTBI subjects were observed. It was previously showed that the SOCS-3-stimulating cytokines IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, and resistin were higher in active TB than healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Notably, the SOCS-3 molecule, but not any of other SOCS family members, is the main downstream resistin signaling molecule [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Whether this mechanism explains higher expression of SOCS-3 mRNA in active TB than LTBI and healthy subjects was not demonstrated in this study. The observed lower SOCS-3 mRNA levels in LTBI than healthy and active TB subjects may also be attributed to changes in the level of posttranscriptional modification, which is evident by the greater amount of SOCS-3-targeting microRNA hsa-miR-221-3p [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Significant variations were also found in the up-regulated or down-regulated expressions of other miR molecules (e.g., has-miR-146a-5p, has-miR-150-5p and has-miR-16-5p) and their predicted target genes (e.g., <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>CXCL2</italic>) when active TB subjects were compared to healthy and LTBI subjects [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Whether these molecules are associated with down-regulated levels of SOCS-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and CIS-1 mRNAs in active TB subjects is unknown.</p><p>In support of this study, we attempted to link the expression of SOCSs to their regulatory downstream molecules that could have been altered by decreased or elevated SOCS expression. For example, the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-4, and IL-10 have been reported by various laboratory studies as the target genes of SOCS-2, -3, -4, and -5, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The target genes of CIS-1 were found to include c-fos, whey acidic protein (WAP), and IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2R&#x003b2;) [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When our data linked to those reported microarray study [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we indeed found that active TB subjects revealed the lowest expressions of SOCS-2 and SOCS-4 among 3 groups of the clinical subjects in the respective associations with the highest expressions of IRF-3 and IL-4. The SOCS-3 shown in ascending expressive order of this study was LTBI, healthy, and active TB subjects and such an order was strengthened by the findings that the IL-1&#x003b2; were the lowest in LTBI patients and the highest in active TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among the three clinical subjects, active TB patients possessed the least SOCS-5, CIS-1, c-fos [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and IL-2R&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] mRNAs, as well as the greatest IL-10 [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and WAP [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] mRNAs. The close link of particular SOCS family members to their target genes provided somewhat more power to the SOCSs measured in this study and led us to understand more discrimination of active TB from healthy and LTBI subjects.</p><p>Our study showed that the levels of SOCS-1 mRNA had no significant differences among healthy, LTBI, and active TB subjects. This finding is consistent with those reported no significant differences of SOCS-1 expression in PBMCs between healthy and severe TB subjects living in London [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or in Pakistan [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Notably, our finding is inconsistent with those reported subcellular data that showed greater SOCS-1 expression in T cells of severe TB patients living in Pakistan [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and that showed greater SOCS-1 expression in neutrophils and monocytes, but not in CD4 or CD8 T cells, of severe TB patients living in London [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When PBMCs were isolated from endemic controls and pulmonary TB patients and then stimulated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, respectively, they exhibited greater SOCS-1 expression in TB patients relative to the controls [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-induced SOCS-1 expression in PBMC cells was not observed in patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis relative to the controls [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Alternative explanations for the discrepancy are that the various types of white blood cells are present in the reported experimental condition of PBMCs and that the distinct types of white blood cells express SOCS-1 at varying levels between healthy and TB subjects in response to the <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulations of lymphokines and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further subcellular analysis will help clarify whether SOCS-1 is differentially expressed in T cells, neutrophils, and monocytes between healthy and TB subjects living in Taiwan.</p><p>Differential activation or inhibition of immune responses by SOCS family members have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. SOCS-1 negatively regulates the differentiation of helper T cells (Th) 1 and 2, but promotes Th17 differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. SOCS-2 inhibits Th2 differentiation and maintains the stability of the regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Transgenic SOCS-3 expression inhibits Th1 and Th17 differentiation and promotes Th2 development, while SOCS-3 silencing attenuated the Th2 response and promotes Th17 differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Transgenic SOCS-5 expression suppresses IL-4-induced Th2 differentiation. SOCS-6 controls T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation, and SOCS-7 knockout mice possess increased mast cell numbers [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The CIS-1 transgenic mice develop defects in T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell development [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The SOCS family was also reported to regulate the function and development of macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglial cells [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Accordingly, our findings that active TB subjects possessed higher SOCS-3 expression and lower SOCS-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and CIS-1 mRNA levels than healthy subjects support the existence of the different immune responses to cytokine signaling between two groups of subjects and suggest the favorite Th2 development in TB subjects. The notion is consistent with those reported for changes in the cytokine profiles of Th cell subpopulation in tuberculosis [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We should note that the observed lowest CIS-1 mRNA levels in PBMCs of the Taiwanese TB patients is inconsistent from those reported greater CIS-1 expression in T cells of the Germany TB patients relative to LTBI patients [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As PBMCs used in our experiment contain a variety of white blood cells that express varying levels of CIS-1 and its upstream signal elements, we could not exclude the possibility that the presence of the subtypes of T cells and the other types of white blood cells may help explain our observed differential CIS-1 expression between healthy and TB subjects. As CIS-1 promoter polymorphisms, particularly rs414171 and rs809451, could regulate CIS-1 expression in lymphocytes and contribute to the susceptibility to tuberculosis in Han Chinese population [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], this genetic mechanism may also help explain lower CIS-1 expression in Taiwanese TB patients.</p><p>Among the subjects screened at our clinic, 106 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There are 35 healthy individuals (16 men and 19 women), 29 LTBI subjects (12 men and 17 women), and 42 active TB subjects (30 men and 12 women) enrolled in this study. Another possible explanation for the exclusion is that some RNA samples from the healthy and LTBI subjects were not collected with a good quality for PCR analysis. This may cause the slight difference in the male: female ratio in healthy, LTBI and TB to be about 46:54, 41:59, and 71:29, respectively. Under the similar male: female ratio, LTBI but not healthy subjects indicated gender-dependent differences of SOCS-2 and CIS-1 mRNA levels. Interestingly, active TB groups with reversed male: female ratio compared to the other groups had no significant differences in both SOCS genes that showed gender-specific differences in LTBI group. Whether the male: female ratio explains the expression difference of particular SOCS molecules in healthy, LTBI and TB subjects is possible, but this requires further demonstrations. Notably, according to the means and the number of subjects, the levels of the statistical power for total subjects, genders, and age ranged from 0.81&#x02013;1 (except the power was 0.73 when the SOCS-3 was examined with a comparison between healthy and active TB subject), from 0.66&#x02013;1, and from 0.64&#x02013;1, respectively. Although the total number of subjects provided sufficient power (&#x0003e;0.8) and the variations were smaller in many of the small sample size grouped subjects, we could not exclude the possibility that the number of subjects in some groups used in this study may be too low to separate them by age and/or gender while keeping sufficient power. Thus, a future study to further increase the number of each grouped subjects will help solidify the gender- and age-dependent differences of the SOCS molecules among healthy, LTBI, and TB subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early important reports have extensively indicated many candidate biomarkers for discrimination of healthy subjects from LTBI and TB patients by employing microarray analysis and PCR analysis [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176377.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In support of these reports, we indicate that a specific type of SOCS gene expresses differently between healthy individuals and TB subjects living in Taiwan. Expressions of SOCS-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and CIS-1 genes and their correlative relationship can help in understanding discrimination of healthy individuals from TB subjects, or discrimination of LTBI from active TB subjects. Although the different mRNA expression profiles of the eight SOCS molecules occur between TB and healthy subjects and possibly vary with the gender and age, SOCS-3 seems to be the best candidate among SOCS molecules for distinguishing male healthy individuals from LTBI subjects. As the SOCS family functions to act as negative regulators of cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which can modulate immunological response of host to the <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176377.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], significant differences found in expressions of SOCS-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and CIS-1 genes among healthy, LTBI and active TB subjects may reflect the roles of the seven members of the SOCS family involved in immune regulation and cytokine signaling of human tuberculosis.</p></sec>
