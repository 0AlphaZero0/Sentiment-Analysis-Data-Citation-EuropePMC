<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Of the estimated 10.4 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) annually, at least 1million (10%) occurred in children (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The BCG vaccine confers partial protection against disseminated TB in young children but has variable efficacy against pulmonary TB (PTB), and better vaccines are urgently required. Following infection, children have a higher risk not only of progression to disease but also of dissemination or extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) and death, and this risk decreases with increasing age (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Characterizing the mycobacterial-specific immune responses in children affected by either PTB or EPTB may provide insight into the mechanisms of immune containment, which are essential in the search for correlates of protection, so urgently required for a better vaccine against TB.</p><p>T cell immunity is well recognized as essential for protection against TB infection and disease, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion, such as seen in HIV, is a contributing factor to TB susceptibility. Mycobacterial-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells primarily produce Th1 cytokines, which include IFN&#x003b3;, IL-2, and TNF&#x003b1;. However, recent studies report a lack of correlation between immune protection imparted by BCG and IFN&#x003b3;, produced by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Hence, these data support the notion that although CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and IFN&#x003b3; are important components of an effective anti-mycobacterial immune response, they do not fully explain observed differences in host susceptibility to TB. Other cell types, such as &#x003b3;&#x003b4;, Th17, and regulatory T cells are also considered important, but these T cell populations have not been studied in children with PTB or EPTB (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Animal models have established that the presence of an excessive number of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells producing IL17 lead to severe disseminated disease (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is likely in humans that the balance between mycobacterial antigen-specific IL17 and IFN&#x003b3;-producing T cells is also of importance in protection against TB disease and in particular, EPTB. This has not been examined in children but would be compatible with their known higher susceptibility to progress to pulmonary and disseminated disease, given the relatively impaired production of IFN&#x003b3; in young age (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Increased numbers of regulatory T cells have been found in adults with TB infection and disease in comparison to healthy controls, particularly in patients with EPTB, a finding that persists even in patients with &#x0201c;cured&#x0201d; EPTB (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Regulatory T cells expressing FOXP3 correlate well with regulatory activity; however, the FOXP3 marker is also present in activated T cells in the presence of IL2. Recently, CD39 was found to be expressed on a subpopulation of regulatory T cells. CD39 is an ectonucleotidase that cleaves ATP in a rate-limiting step to form AMP, which can then be cleaved by CD73 to form adenosine. Extracellular ATP has multiple pro-inflammatory effects, and its removal may, therefore, have a net anti-inflammatory influence. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD39<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells are found to suppress IL17 production and are increased in TB patients after antigen-specific stimulation. Depletion of these cells resulted in increased antigen-specific IFN&#x003b3; CD4 T cell responses (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We chose to measure CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD39<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells based on the most recent literature, suggesting that these markers most accurately identify functionally suppressive regulatory T cells in humans, influence mycobacterial specific responses in patients with TB disease and play a role in influencing the immune response to novel TB vaccines (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). To date, there are no studies that have examined the role of regulatory T cells in different clinical manifestations of pediatric TB.</p><p>Based on these interesting data, we hypothesized that the mycobacterial-specific immune response in children with TB, in particular EPTB, would have an increased frequency of both IL17-producing &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and regulatory T cells in comparison with healthy controls. We aimed to characterize these T cell populations in a group of HIV-negative children with PTB and EPTB compared to healthy children without any evidence of sensitization to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (M.tb). The aim of this study was to compare immune responses to mycobacteria in children with PTB, EPTB, and healthy controls.</p><p>Our data show that regulatory T cells are increased in children with TB disease compared to healthy controls, but do not discriminate between pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB disease. This is associated with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which corresponds with recent gene expression studies (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Furthermore, as these immune responses were also examined following treatment, we can now confirm they are TB-disease specific, rather than a product of young age or host differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participant Enrollment and Classification</title><p>The study was conducted at Red Cross Children&#x02019;s Hospital (RCH) in Cape Town, South Africa. Children between birth and 16&#x02009;years were enrolled to three different groups: pulmonary TB (PTB) disease, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) disease, and healthy, non-M.tb sensitized children. Children with TB disease presented to RCH with symptoms consistent with active TB and the following clinical details were evaluated: presenting symptoms, history of TB contact, CXR/radiological findings, microscopy, and culture for M.tb, and clinical examination findings. Children with culture-confirmed or GeneXpert-positive disease were classified as &#x0201c;confirmed&#x0201d; TB. Children who fitted the clinical criteria, but did not have microbiological confirmation, were treated for TB disease, and responded to treatment were classified as &#x0201c;unconfirmed&#x0201d; TB. TB disease extending beyond the pleural cavity was classified as EPTB. Children were excluded if they had received treatment for TB lasting longer than 72&#x02009;h, they did not live in Cape Town, they were unable to attend follow-up visits, or informed consent was not given.</p><p>Healthy controls were recruited from well children who presented to RCH for elective surgical interventions. An in-house interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was used to determine M.tb sensitization status; children with a positive IGRA were further evaluated for active TB but not included in this analysis. Children with a negative IGRA were classified as healthy controls. Exclusion criteria for healthy controls were known contact with TB; prior treatment for TB, history of recurrent infections, or hospital admissions; persistent cough for longer than 4&#x02009;weeks; intercurrent febrile illness; and failure to thrive or known immunodeficiency. All children had received BCG vaccination at birth, and only HIV-negative children were included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Blood Collection, Stimulation, and Cryopreservation</title><p>Blood samples from children with TB disease were taken within 48&#x02009;h of enrollment and repeated after completion of 6&#x02009;months treatment.</p><p>Heparinized blood was incubated within 4&#x02009;h with BCG (SSI strain, 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>cfu/ml), as previously described (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Our study compared different clinical manifestations of TB disease and included a comprehensive range of T cell populations, using two different immunological assays to capture both effector and central memory T cell responses. Additionally, we tested these responses at time of diagnosis and following treatment.</p><p>We found an increased frequency of regulatory T cells in children with TB disease, not previously reported, although we did not see differences between children with PTB and EPTB. Our results, therefore, differ from adult data that reported a 2.3-fold increase in FOXP3 expression in patients with EPTB compared to PTB (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The use of the surface marker CD39 may explain the difference between our findings and the limited studies in adults. It is also possible that regulatory T cells in young children behave differently from those in adult patients, where active TB is more likely to arise from reactivation or reinfection than the primary infection most commonly seen in young children. Infants have been shown to have greater numbers of CD45RA<sup>+</sup> phenotypically na&#x000ef;ve regulatory T cells which are functionally different, proliferating, and persisting for longer than the CD45RA-regulatory T cells which predominate in adults. The role of these different phenotypes of regulatory T cells may have been interesting to explore in this cohort (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated suppression of effector immune responses, such as IFN&#x003b3; production by CD4 T cells in children with TB in comparison to healthy controls (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Our data show lack of suppression of Th1 immune responses as measured by either the IFN&#x003b3; production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or the Ki67 proliferative capacity of these T cells. However, we found suppression of Th17 responses (IL17 and IL22 production by CD4 and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells) as well as significantly lower levels of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, and IFN&#x003b3;, following stimulation of whole blood with BCG for 6&#x02009;days. This finding is in line with adult data, which also demonstrated suppressed levels of antigen-specific immune responses to mycobacteria at the time of diagnosis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and more recently a small pediatric study reporting suppressed IFN&#x003b3; effector responses, which were measured as secreted cytokines following PPD stimulation after 24&#x02009;h (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A number of hypotheses have been formulated regarding this phenomenon of antigen-specific suppression of immune responses, including compartmentalization of relevant cell populations at the site of disease or an active and selective depletion of mycobacteria-specific T cells during TB disease (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is also possible that M.tb itself induces relative immunosuppression as a mechanism for survival in the host, in line with transcriptomic data which show downregulation of immune response genes in the presence of M.tb in both adults and children (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Whether these findings represent &#x0201c;the chicken or the egg&#x0201d; remains to be fully established, but the fact that T cell responses recover following treatment in the PTB cohort might indicate that it is induced by the disease rather than representing a persistent underlying host immuno-phenotype.</p><p>In addition to regulatory T cells and CD4 T cell responses, our study also characterized the role of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in the immune response to mycobacteria in children with TB. We report that although &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells expand, proliferate, and produce both Th1 and Th17 cytokines in response to BCG stimulation in children with different manifestations of TB disease, they do not appear to behave in a counter-regulatory fashion to CD4 T cells, as we had originally hypothesized. Dieli et al. showed increased proliferative capacity of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, but decreased IFN&#x003b3; production in children with TB compared to healthy controls and an increase in IFN&#x003b3; production after treatment (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similarly, our data demonstrate that BCG-induced &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells produce significantly less IFN&#x003b3; and IL17 in children with active TB disease at the time of diagnosis compared to healthy controls, but increase following treatment. Interestingly, we did not demonstrate a correlating suppression of IL22 production in active TB at the time of diagnosis compared to healthy children. In non-human primates with severe TB disease, unbalanced upregulation of immune gene networks, including overexpression of IL22, was demonstrated by Yao et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Scriba et al. described a distinct subset of IL22-producing T cells in the lungs of adult patients with TB disease, and IL22 was found to be more abundant in both blood and at the disease site of patients with pericardial TB disease (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells have previously been identified as the source of IL22 in adults with TB disease (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). IL22 is known to either enhance a pro-inflammatory state in the presence of IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL2, and IL17 or in their absence is recognized to have immune regulatory and regenerative functions. In our cohort, this latter immune regulatory state appears to predominate, with increased regulatory T cells and decreased IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; present in children with active TB disease.</p><p>Despite measuring immediate and proliferative responses, the assays performed in this study were unable to distinguish between pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. A number of studies have explored this previously with discordant results. Verbon et al. demonstrated that unstimulated cytokine levels in serum were present in equivalent levels in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, while Sharma et al. recorded higher levels in miliary TB, a form of severe extrapulmonary TB, compared to pleural TB (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Conversely, a number of studies have demonstrated that both unstimulated and stimulated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are present in lower levels in adults with extrapulmonary or severe TB disease compared to pulmonary TB (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), both at the time of treatment and afterward (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), leading to suggestions of an underlying immune defect in those patients who develop extrapulmonary TB disease. In particular, regulatory T cells and circulating levels of IL10 have been suggested to be increased in patients with extrapulmonary TB both during the disease period and subsequently (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These studies were performed in adults who are likely to present with reactivation disease and high bacterial loads, unlike children who usually develop primary progressive paucibacillary disease. It is, therefore, not surprising that these results differ from our own findings and between study populations.</p><p>We repeated all assays in our TB cohorts following completion of 6 months treatment to determine whether the study findings were possibly due to an underlying susceptibility for TB disease or represented a phenomenon induced by active disease. In agreement with other investigators, our data show recovery of the antigen-specific responses post treatment to levels that were of greater magnitude than those reported in healthy children. This would indicate that their suppression in face of acute disease represents a pathogen-induced response. Interestingly, the recovery response was of lesser magnitude in children with EPTB. Whether this may be attributable to higher bacillary burden at the onset of disease or slower clearance rates of mycobacteria cannot be determined, as we did not have the capacity to collect this information as part of our study. It is, however, recognized that patients with ETPB have higher rates of culture confirmation and relapse than those with PTB, justifying the usually longer treatment course. Another explanation may be that these children represent a cohort in whom the original BCG vaccine was less effective, but given that there were no significant differences in acquired immune responses as measured by BCG-specific, IFN&#x003b3;-producing CD4 T cells at the time of diagnosis, this seems unlikely. Published data have already shown that IFN&#x003b3; responses measured at 10&#x02009;weeks post BCG vaccination in a Cape Town Cohort could not distinguish between infants at risk of TB disease over time, further refuting this possibility (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that the frequency of regulatory T cells is increased in both PTB and EPTB following treatment. While this could be explained at the time of diagnosis as a response to the presence of high levels of antigen, it is an unlikely explanation after 6&#x02009;months of effective treatment for TB. This may represent an underlying susceptibility to TB disease in these children. Alternatively, the memory recall response to BCG, which results in expansion of effector T cells at the end of treatment, may equally induce the expansion of regulatory T cells.</p><p>A unique strength of our study is the number of children recruited and their thorough clinical and immunological characterization within distinct groups, including healthy controls. It is noteworthy that there were no significant differences between the immune responses to mycobacteria in the clinically diagnosed vs microbiologically confirmed TB groups. It was also somewhat surprising that the median age of children with EPTB was 5&#x02009;years, since EPTB is historically associated with younger children. The median age of 96 children with EPTB recruited as part of a parallel diagnostic study in Cape Town was 48.9&#x02009;months also (personal communication). This may reflect protection conferred by BCG vaccination at birth or could represent a location bias because of recruitment in hospital rather than in the community. Additionally, much of the EPTB was either bone, joint, or pleural disease, rather than miliary or disseminated disease which is normally described in the younger infants.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the relatively short duration of follow-up of the TB cohort for 6&#x02009;months. Repeating the assays after a period of 2&#x02009;years to determine whether the increased responses observed following 6&#x02009;months of treatment returned to healthy control levels with time could be of interest. Despite designing our study to be age-matched with the expectation that children under 2&#x02009;years would present with extrapulmonary TB, the children with extrapulmonary TB were older. Although some immune responses are known to mature with age, antigen-specific immune responses to BCG in infants are comparable to those seen in adults (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). A further limitation of the study was the heterogeneity of disease in the EPTB cohort, as children with bone or joint TB may represent a different immunological pathogenesis than disseminated miliary TB or TB meningitis. The median age remained the same in the subgroups, but the numbers in each group were too small to reach significant conclusions. A further limiting factor is that the assays were performed only in blood, which may not reflect mechanisms of disease in the lung or other sites of disease, but obtaining samples from the site of disease in children is challenging.</p><p>In conclusion, we report for the first time that regulatory T cells are increased in patients with active TB disease, but that they do not distinguish between EPTB and PTB. CD4 effector T cell responses, typically used in diagnostics and as markers of vaccine efficacy, do not distinguish between TB disease and healthy children in this cohort, but we report suppressed levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells cytokine responses in children with TB disease compared to healthy controls. However, this does not explain why some children develop EPTB and others PTB. Further investigation of the relationship between regulatory T cells and innate immune responses is required to define correlates of immune protection associated with clinical manifestations of childhood TB.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town with written informed consent from all subjects.
