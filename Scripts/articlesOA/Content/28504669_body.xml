Thus, to specifically assess the importance of NO's ability to prevent IL-1 dependent neutrophil recruitment, we allowed the infection to progress for two weeks before inhibiting IL-1 signaling with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Rn) and/or depleting granulocytic precursors with the cytosine analog gemcitabine. Gemcitabine treatment reduced the number of lung neutrophils, histopathological disease, and wasting observed in Mtb-infected <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, and the co-administration of IL-1Rn accentuated this effect (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>).

As a result, we hypothesized that neutrophil-rich lesions might represent a relatively benign niche for Mtb. To understand how growth in association with neutrophils altered the bacterial environment, we profiled the behavior of a bacterial mutant library in mice that develop histiocytic (C57BL/6) and granulocytic (<italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) lesions.

Our global phenotypic analysis of bacterial mutants showed no indication of altered usage of analogous trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) or nitrate reductases in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1 and 2</xref>). Instead, Mtb appears to exploit the increased accessibility of nutrients in granulocyte-rich lesions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). We speculate that the inferred abundance of nutrients is due to the cell death observed in advanced TB lesions, which are rich in the lipid carbon substrates preferred by Mtb<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and are likely to contain iron sources such as heme that Mtb can acquire without mycobactin<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. A remarkable similarity between these two pathogens is the common reliance on inflammation for efficient transmission, salmonella via generation of bacteria-rich inflammatory diarrhea, and Mtb via generation of cavitary lesions that facilitate the production of infectious aerosols. Enhancement of transmission provides strong selection for these pathogens to thrive at sites of intense inflammation that would be lethal to other microbes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Mice</title><p id="P23">C57BL/6 (stock no. 000664), <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129P2-Nos2&#x02122;<sup>1Lau</sup>/J, stock no. 002609), <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S2-<italic>Alox15&#x02122;<sup>1Fun</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 002778) and <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S2-<italic>Alox5&#x02122;<sup>1Fun</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 004155), C3HeB/FeJ (stock no. 00658), B6.SJL-<italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup> Pepc<sup>b</sup></italic>/BoyJ carrying the pan leukocyte marker CD45.1 or Ly-5.1 (stock no. 002014), <italic>Ltb4r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S4-<italic>Ltb4r1&#x02122;<sup>1Adl</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 008102), <italic>Il1r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S7-<italic>Il1r1&#x02122;<sup>1Imx</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 003245and <italic>Nlrp3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S6-<italic>Nlrp3&#x02122;<sup>1Bhk</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 021302) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

Sections were stained for nuclei (DAPI, blue staining), ALOX12 (Alexa488, green staining), myeloperoxidase, MPO, to identify granulocytes (Cy3, red staining), and Iba-1, a macrophage marker (Cy5, cyan staining). As controls, pre-immune serum and isotype matched controls were used (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary figure 8</xref>). After incubation, the tissues were washed several times with sterile TBS at room temperature and incubated in the respective secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, anti-goat or anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa-488, Alexa588, or Alexa-647) and streptavidin conjugated to Texas-red for mycobacterium detection for at least 1h at room temperature. Tissue sections were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, grand Island, NY) with DAPI, and the tissue sections were examined in an A1 confocal microscope equipped with a spectrum detection and unmixing systems (Nikon Instruments Inc., Japan). Antibody specificity was confirmed by replacing the primary antibody with a non-specific myeloma protein of the same isotype or non-immune serum.</p><p id="P51">Three-dimensional reconstruction and deconvolution of areas of interest was performed from 12 to 25 optical sections obtained at 0.250 or 0.150 &#x003bc;m intervals<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. To analyze and quantify abundance of the study proteins, the number of positive pixels as well as their intensity in macrophages were measured in specific regions of interest. In addition, for each cell population, a linear intensity histogram was generated to examine the expression of each enzyme inside defined cell types or in caseum. To measure the distance from the center of the granuloma or cavity in a manner that was consistent across lesions with caseous foci of varying diameters, we used the macrophage layer directly subtending the caseum as the &#x02018;anchor point&#x02019; and computed pixel density both in the inward and outward directions from the anchor point. To compare protein abundance across tissues, similar numbers of cells and areas were included in the 3D deconvoluted optical reconstructions. This analysis avoids problems associated with inflammatory versus normal tissues where density and structure of the tissue are different. Adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin &#x00026; eosin (H &#x00026; E), correlate the confocal findings with histopathology of the same tissue sections. Co-localization and numbers of positive pixels for each color was quantified by using the imaging software NIS Elements (Nikon, Japan). Analysis of nuclei, macrophage, and H &#x00026; E staining identified at least 5 different layers from the center of the cavity going outward: caseum (acellular); caseum outer rim (interface between caseum and macrophages); macrophage rim (area enriched for Iba-1 positive cells); and uninvolved lung containing minimal infiltration of monocytes and granulocytes. A student's t-test was used for comparing fluorescence average intensities in different regions. Individual pixels with an intensity equal or greater than 8% of the maximum intensity were considered positive (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00042).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P52">The statistical significance of differences between data groups was determined using the Unpaired two tailed student's <italic>t</italic>-test, or one-way ANOVA using Tukey's multiple comparison test using Graphpad Prism 6; * (p&#x0003c;0.05) ** (p&#x0003c;0.001) *** (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) denotes significant differences compared as indicated in figures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S32"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS865459-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1507" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec>
