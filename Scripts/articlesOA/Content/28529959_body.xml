<sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Originally discovered for their antiviral activity, type I interferons (IFNs) are now known to also impact a variety of infectious and inflammatory disease states that are not exclusive to the antiviral response [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In fact, the story of type I IFNs reaches beyond the protective role for which they were discovered. Not only can these potent cytokines defend the host from viral infection but they can also promote persistent viral infection in some settings [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, these cytokines can either harm or benefit the host in autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, type I IFNs are treatments for some viral infections and autoimmune diseases, stressing the importance of understanding their impact on the host immune system [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Not surprisingly, type I IFNs can have opposing effects during both intracellular and extracellular bacterial infections as well. Because type I IFNs are produced during an immense number of distinct infections and inflammatory diseases, their importance from an evolutionary and immune standpoint is clear.</p><p>Type I IFNs are one of three types of interferons. Type I, II, and III IFNs are classified based on activity, structure, and corresponding receptor type. There are many groups of type I IFNs: IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic>, <italic>&#x003c4;</italic>, and <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Of the type I IFNs, IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> are most well-studied. There is only one IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> while there are 12 subtypes of IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in humans and 14 in mice [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Type II IFN consists of only IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> while there are four types of type III IFNs in humans and two in mice [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interferons can induce immune changes at minimal concentration; thus, tight regulation of interferon responses is required and may be determined, in part, by interferon receptor distribution and expression [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most, if not all, cells can respond to and produce type I IFNs, but plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are some of the most robust producers. They can generate 10-fold more IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> than monocytes [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although pDCs will not be discussed in relation to the intracellular bacteria covered in this review, their role as robust type I IFN producers is likely an important part of the immune response.</p><p>Despite disparate survival strategies, intracellular and extracellular bacteria are both capable of inducing type I IFNs with some overlap in induction pathways. Whereas intracellular bacteria can activate intracellular sensors from within the phagolysosome or cytoplasm, extracellular bacteria introduce type I IFN-stimulating ligands into the cytosol via pore-forming proteins or other means [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This review concentrates on the actions of type I IFNs in the context of intracellular bacterial infections. The functions of these cytokines in other microbial infections, cancer, and autoimmunity have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The following sections will describe pathways leading to, and the downstream results of, type I IFN production.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Induction of Type I IFNs</title><p>Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are sensed by their cognate pattern recognition receptor (PRRs), which leads to transcription of many gene products, including type I IFNs. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducing gene I- (RIG-I-) like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain- (NOD-) like receptors (NLRs) are all PRRs. TLRs and CLRs are transmembrane receptors, whereas RLRs and NLRs reside in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Multiple PRRs can be engaged during infection, leading to an orchestrated innate immune response that is specific to a pathogen's repertoire of PAMPs.</p><p>TLRs sense PAMPs, including nucleic acids and lipoproteins from invading pathogens, and either are expressed on the cell surface or are present in endosomes and lysosomes in immune cells. Endosomal TLRs recognize viral and bacterial nucleic acids and lead to type I IFN production; these are TLR3, 7, and 9 in mice and humans [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While TLR3 is mostly expressed intracellularly, cell surface TLR3 has been observed on human dendritic cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and synovial fibroblasts of rheumatoid arthritis patients [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. TLR4, found on the cell surface, recognizes the gram-negative bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Following TLR-ligand binding, signaling occurs via two main adaptor protein pathways, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) or TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> (TRIF) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All TLRs signal through MyD88 except TLR3, which utilizes only TRIF, and TLR4 which utilizes TRIF or MyD88 [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. TRIF signaling leads to type I IFN production via TANK-binding kinase- (TBK-1-) mediated activation of transcription factors, interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 or 7. Alternatively, downstream of MyD88, inflammatory genes are induced via transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, endosomal MyD88 signaling leads to type I IFN production via IL-1R1-associated protein kinase 4- (IRAK4-) mediated activation of IRF7 [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Of the nucleic acid sensing TLRs, TLR9 is the only DNA sensor and is expressed on endosomes or cell surfaces [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. TLR9 specifically detects unmethylated CpG DNA from bacteria [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. TLR9 has been shown to be important during infection with <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (SesT), <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, and controversially in the context of <italic>B. abortus</italic> [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There is little or no direct evidence of type I IFN production downstream of TLR9 in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and SesT infection and disparate results regarding <italic>B. abortus</italic>; thus, it will not be discussed in detail [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Several DNA sensors, mostly cytoplasmic, have been identified. They can lead to type I IFN production, as well as inflammasome formation, autophagy, necrosis, apoptosis, and production of inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cytosolic DNA sensors can be categorized into two distinct signaling pathways, namely, the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)/casapase-1 inflammasome pathway, which activates pro-IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and pro-IL-18, and the interferon stimulatory DNA pathway (ISD), which leads to type I IFN production [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The main ISD pathway involves cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of IFN genes (STING). Upon viral or bacterial DNA sensing, cGAS generates cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), like cGAMP, which activate STING, an endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein that induces production of type I IFNs in a TBK1/IRF3-dependent manner [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This mode of DNA detection has been observed in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Finally, type I IFN production also occurs following DNA or polyI(dA:dT) sensing via RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which converts DNA into RNA ligands for RIG-I [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There has been little progress in understanding the mechanism of Pol III-mediated type I IFN production and blocking Pol III has no effect on type I IFN transcript levels in certain cell types [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Nonetheless, this pathway has been implicated in DNA detection and subsequent type I IFN production during infection with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Though there is still more to learn in regard to detection of DNA and type I IFN induction, it is clear that DNA sensing is integral to innate immune recognition of intracellular pathogens.</p><p>Type I IFNs are produced in response to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) sensing of dsRNA, mostly derived from viruses. However, some studies reveal evidence of RLR involvement during intracellular bacterial infections with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, SesT, and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) are all RLRs. RIG-I recognizes short viral dsRNA or ssRNA with a 5&#x02032;-triphosphate group while MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA and its synthetic analog, polyI:C [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. After ligand recognition, RIG-I and MDA5 caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) interact with a mitochondrial/peroxisomal-associated protein, interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also called MAVS, Cardif or VISA). This is followed by phosphorylation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B or IRF-3, similar to processes that occur following TLR stimulation [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. MDA5 and RIG-I sequences are conserved in the C terminus and helicase domain of LGP2 but unlike the other RLRs, LGP2 does not contain a CARD region [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This feature has made it challenging to elucidate the role of LGP2. Type I IFN induction via these receptors is becoming an important pathway to understand in the context of intracellular bacterial infections.</p><p>Like RLRs and DNA sensors, NLRs are cytosolic sentinels of pathogen invasion. NLRs are expressed in both immune and nonimmune cells, such as epithelial cells, and thus far, there are 22 recognized NLRs in humans and 34 in mice [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Similar to TLRs, PAMPs bind NLRs, leading to activation of inflammatory pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, inflammasome activation, and type I IFN production [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For example, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activation can occur via NOD1 or NOD2 in response to peptidoglycan from gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria, respectively [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Following ligation, NLR proteins oligomerize and interact via their CARD domains with adaptor protein, receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIP2 or RIPK2), which is required for both NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and MAPK pathway activation and inflammatory gene expression [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition to activation of proinflammatory cascades which have been reviewed elsewhere [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], NLRs have been implicated in induction of type I IFN expression via IRF7 or 3 activation [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Given the large number of NLRs expressed across species, it is evident they are important innate intracellular sensors.</p><p>C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are transmembrane innate receptors that are known for their roles in antifungal immunity but more recently have been shown to play a role in innate immunity to bacteria, viruses, and helminths [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Carbohydrate recognition domains on CLRs allow these receptors to interact with not only various carbohydrate motifs but lipids and proteins that may also be present on pathogenic microbes. CLRs can be divided into three categories: immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif domains (ITAM) and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Syk-independent immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif domains (ITIM), and those which do not clearly signal through either ITAM or ITIM. A number of bacteria, including the intracellular bacteria <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, are known to signal through CLRs like DC-SIGN and Dectin-1. But, thus far, CLR-induced suppression or induction of type I IFNs has not been documented in the context of intracellular bacterial infections [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Type I IFN Signaling</title><p>Once type I IFNs are produced and released, they can interact with the same cell that produced them in an autocrine manner or bind to other cells in a paracrine fashion. All type I IFNs signal through a common receptor composed of two chains, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> can also signal through IFNAR1 alone to induce an entirely unique subset of genes, suggesting that abundance of each, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, may influence downstream gene expression [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The conventional and most well-studied pathway of type I IFN signal transduction is the JAK-STAT pathway, but non-STAT signaling pathways exist as well. Non-STAT pathways include the MAPK pathways, mTORC2 pathways that are dependent on Akt, and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Following IFNAR receptor engagement, JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, which then dimerize and form a complex with IRF9. This complex, called interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), translocates to the nucleus where it binds interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) leading to expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In addition to STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimers, other STAT homo- or heterodimers are induced by both type I and type II IFNs. These can bind IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-activated sites (GAS), which leads to production of yet another unique set of genes [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Clearly there are numerous pathways that lead to induction of type I IFNs and cellular recognition of type I IFNs can lead to differing outcomes. In most cases involving innate responses to viral infection, type I IFNs are beneficial. In contrast, when considering intracellular bacterial infection, the roles of type I IFNs are less defined and clearly need to be considered individually. In the following sections, we will discuss bacteria that reside and replicate inside cells and the role that type I IFNs play in their pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Type I IFN Production during Infection with Intracellular Bacteria</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and <italic>C. muridarum</italic></title><p>Some of the first evidence for type I IFNs as antibacterial effectors was observed in elegant experiments with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> in the early 1970s. Mice treated with Newcastle disease virus or polyI:C and challenged with aerosolized <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> had postponed mortality [<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. However, these results were dependent on the route of virus or polyI:C administration. Other early experiments showed that treating human or mouse cell lines with type I IFN before infection with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> decreased infectivity of the pathogen [<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A possible explanation for these antibacterial effects is the ability of type I IFNs to effect important factors for bacterial growth. Type I IFNs can deplete intracellular iron and effect L-tryptophan catabolism via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In addition, when IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> is combined with IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> or TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in vitro, the antichlamydial effect of each cytokine alone increases [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This suggests that, in vivo, these cytokines may act together to control infection. However, these results are not replicable in the genital infection model using <italic>C. muridarum</italic>. In these experiments, mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212;) have reduced bacterial burden and clear the infection more quickly than wild-type mice [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The decrease in bacterial burden in IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice is attributed to increased chlamydial-specific CD4 T cell responses and increased CXCL9, a cytokine responsible for T cell recruitment [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Finally, recent in vitro infection models suggest that the DNA sensor, cGAS, detects chlamydial DNA which leads to expression of IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> via STING [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although initial studies suggested that type I IFNs were important for host survival during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection, utilizing a different model and strain-provided opposite results. Thus, it is not clear whether type I IFNs benefit or harm the host in this context.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>4.2. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic></title><p>Type I IFNs are induced during infection with gram-positive <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, which is engulfed by macrophages/monocytes. Rather than being destroyed, the organism survives and replicates within these cells. Survival is due to production of lysteriolysin O, a haemolysin that causes rupture of the phagosome and translocation of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> into the cytoplasm where it can be detected by multiple PRRs [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The earliest evidence documenting the relationship between <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and type I IFN production was observed in 1967 when a &#x0201c;viral inhibitor&#x0201d; was measured in the blood of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-infected chickens [<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Follow-up work confirmed the production of type I IFNs during <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection [<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>Immune responses to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> occur via both TLR-dependent and TLR-independent signaling pathways, within phagosomes and in the cytosol, respectively [<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These pathways involve STING, RIG-I, or muramyl dipeptide (MDP) sensor, NOD2, in conjunction with TLR signaling [<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Both <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-derived DNA and CDNs induce production of type I IFNs [<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Hansen et al. revealed that DNA is a stronger inducer of IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in human compared to mouse cells, in which CDNs are more potent stimulators of IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In mouse cells, bacterial DNA is detected via IFI16, cGAS, and STING [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although, it should be noted that recent work has shown IFI16 and other AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are dispensable for detection of intracellular DNA and subsequent type I IFN production [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, the IFI16-cGAS-STING axis described by Hansen et al. should be reexamined.</p><p>Type I IFNs are also produced downstream of RIG-I during infection with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-secreted RNA, but not RNA obtained from a <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> lysate, induces IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> production via RIG-I and MDA5 [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This suggests that live <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is required for type I IFN induction and it may be secreting RNA into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, secreted DNA from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is transcribed into RNA by Pol III, inducing IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> via RIG-I [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. RIG-I and CARD9 are also involved in detection of RNA, inflammasome activation, and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> production. These signaling events are dependent on the bacterial secretion system, SecA2, which may release nucleic acids into the cytosol where they can be detected [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While human macrophage cell lines can produce type I IFNs in response to both <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-derived DNA and RNA, nonimmune cells like human hepatocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cells respond to bacterial RNA in a RIG-I-dependent manner but cannot respond to DNA [<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Understanding type I IFN production in both nonimmune cells and monocytic cells independently is important because <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> encounters and infects both cell types.</p><p>In addition to nucleic acid-mediated bacterial detection and type I IFN production, NOD2 recognizes cell wall components of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and together with TLR signaling, induces IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> [<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Type I IFN responses are most robust when both DNA detection and NOD2 detection of MDP occur simultaneously [<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Leber et al. predicted that the cytosolic response to DNA may occur via DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI). However, the role of DAI in this setting is no longer supported [<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. More recent studies suggest that STING or RIG-I, via Pol III, act as nucleic acid-sensing pathways for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-induced type I IFN production [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The variety of mechanisms of detection for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> PAMPs and subsequent induction of type I IFNs indicate an important role for these cytokines.</p><p>Initial studies suggest that type I IFN production is harmful to the host in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection. This is evidenced by resistance of IFNAR- or IRF3-deficient mice to infection and more severe infection upon type I IFN induction via polyI:C treatment [<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Additionally, STING-dependent type I IFN production correlates with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> pathology and prevents cell-mediated immunity because STING- and IRF3-deficient mice display enhanced cell-mediated immunity [<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Resistance in IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice is due to decreased lymphocyte and macrophage apoptosis because type I IFNs induce production of proapoptotic genes like <italic>Daxx</italic> and <italic>Trail</italic> [<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Furthermore, increased peripheral IL-12p70 and production of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> by CD11b+ macrophages is observed in IFNAR-deficient mice [<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This leads to more productive bacterial clearance [<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Additional mechanisms of type I IFN-mediated morbidity and mortality include cross talk between type I IFNs and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, increased cell-to-cell spread, and decreased splenic neutrophil recruitment [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-infected macrophages secrete type I IFNs which downregulate their own cell surface IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> receptor expression [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This effect is also noted on dendritic cells during systemic infection [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Downregulation of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> receptor occurs due to type I IFN-mediated recruitment of transcriptional regulators, early growth response factor 3 (Egr3), and NGFI-A binding protein 1 (Nab1), to the <italic>ifngr1</italic> promoter and subsequent gene silencing [<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. As a result, myeloid cells are less responsive to IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and more susceptible to infection [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-infected IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have increased numbers of IL-17A-secreting <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells that attract neutrophils, which aid in bacterial control [<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Type I IFN signaling also directly affects the intracellular motility of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> by impacting bacterial ActA polarization and promoting cell-to-cell spread [<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p><p>Though there are many reports displaying the detrimental effects of type I IFNs during <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection, other investigations suggest that these results depend greatly on route of infection. Whereas most of the previously mentioned studies infect intravenously (i.v.), models utilizing foodborne infection, the natural route of infection, show that IFNAR-deficient mice are not more resistant to infection [<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Furthermore, type I IFN-induced apoptosis and decreased neutrophil recruitment to the spleen during i.v. infection are not apparent during oral infection, and decreased IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> receptor expression on myeloid cells occurs independently of type I IFNs [<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Finally, wild-type mice infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) have more severe infection compared to wild-type mice infected orally. Upon oral infection, mice lacking type I IFN responses have worse inflammatory pathology of the liver and delayed protective cytokine responses [<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].

Wasserman et al. determined that cGAS is required for type I IFN induction in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in both mouse and human macrophages. However, rather than direct detection of bacterial CDNs via STING, cGAS must produce CDNs that are detected by STING [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Despite compelling evidence for the cGAS/STING axis being a major component of type I IFN production and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> survival, other investigations have contrasting conclusions. The major finding of these contradictory studies is that cGAS and STING-mediated autophagy is of greater importance to host survival than type I IFN induction [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These disparate results concerning type I IFN induction could potentially be explained by differences in in vitro and in vivo studies, unknown variations across institutions, and differences in dose, strain, and timing.</p><p>Type I IFNs are also produced during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection as a result of activation of the NOD2/RIP2/IRF5 axis. Briefly, in vitro studies in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) suggest a mechanism of type I IFN production which is dependent on ESX1 expression, detection of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-derived MDP via NOD2 and downstream activation of RIP2, TBK1, and IRF5 [<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Additionally, RIP2-dependent induction of type I IFNs is 10&#x02013;100-fold higher when using N-glycolyl MDP from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared to that when using typical bacterial N-acetylated MDP [<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Collectively, it is apparent that this organism evolved an efficient means of persisting that is likely dependent on type I IFNs and the cGAS/STING axis or other type I IFN-inducing pathways.</p><p>The probacterial effects of type I IFNs have been demonstrated multiple times in the context of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species. It is hypothesized that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has evolved to counter the inflammatory effects of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> by inducing type I IFNs. For example, treatment with type I IFNs greatly increases susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and decreases the ability of macrophages to control <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection [<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>, <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Additionally, IL-10-produced downstream of type I IFNs decreases the antibacterial activity of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> in macrophages, an effect reliant on cGAS and STING [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, another group determined that the negative impact of type I IFNs during disease was due to overt inflammation rather than inhibition of inflammation. Using naturally susceptible 129S2 mice, it was shown that depleting IFNAR1 rescues these mice [<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In this model, expression of IFNAR1 on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells increases death of alveolar macrophages, chemokine expression, and neutrophil recruitment to the lung, resulting in fatal inflammation [<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. A recent study suggests that the negative effect of type I IFNs is dependent on IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> expression. In the absence of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, type I IFNs can promote alternative macrophage activation that favors host protection [<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. This may have an impact on human health as some humans have genetic deficiencies in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> signaling.

SesT expresses two type III secretion systems (T3SS), <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island (SPI-1) and 2 (SPI-2), which are responsible for secretion of effector proteins into host cells and bacterial survival [<xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].

Follow-up studies show that these caspase-1-deficient mice are naturally deficient in caspase-11 as well, a noncanonical inflammasome caspase [<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Broz et al. sought to parse out the differential effects of caspase-1 and caspase-11 during infection with SesT and, in doing so, revealed an interesting role for type I IFNs [<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Type I IFNs produced following TLR4/TRIF stimulation, likely via LPS, are required for caspase-11-induced macrophage death and bacterial release. This is detrimental to the host when caspase-1 is absent as it is necessary for neutrophil-mediated control of SesT released by pyroptotic macrophages [<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Although early studies show that mice treated with IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> are protected from lethality upon intragastric SesT infection, more recent data suggests type I IFNs can benefit or harm the host depending on the functionality of caspase-1 [<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Furthermore, i.v.-infected IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have increased survival due to lack of type I IFN-mediated macrophage necroptosis [<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Upon type I IFN signaling, IFNAR associates with RIP1 which leads to cell death via RIP1/RIP3 necroptosis. This only occurs when caspase-8 is blocked, which is relevant to SesT infection as caspase-8 decreases during infection [<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Thus, multiple pathways of SesT-induced cell death that advance pathogenesis are facilitated by type I IFNs.</p><p>IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> treatment is detrimental to the host because it can decrease transcriptional responses in SesT-infected macrophages, specifically IL-18, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, 2, and 5 [<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. In addition, treatment with IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> increases SesT-induced IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> mRNA [<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The effect of IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> on macrophage transcriptional responses is dependent on IL-10, but type I IFN-mediated macrophage necroptosis is not [<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Oral and i.p. infection confirm the harmful effects of IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> that correlate with decreased IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and CXCL2 expression and dampened neutrophil influx to the small intestine [<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. These results suggest that type I IFN, induced by SesT, decreases inflammatory responses thereby allowing for greater SesT propagation.</p><p>The mechanisms of type I IFN-mediated harm depend on route of infection but are correlated with macrophage responses or survival, highlighting the importance of this immune cell during SesT infection. However, nonphagocytic cells also play an important role because, in these cells, type I IFNs are induced by RIG-I in response to SesT [<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Mouse fibroblasts produce IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> downstream of RIG-I upon infection whereas macrophages produce IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> downstream of TLR signaling [<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. These results are relevant in vivo given that SesT can also infect nonphagocytic and nonimmune cells. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential of type I IFNs to act on alternative aspects of immunity, for example, the gut microbiota. Some patients who develop respiratory tract infections with influenza also experience gastrointestinal symptoms of unknown etiology [<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Influenza-induced type I IFNs produced in the lung negatively alter the gut microbiota of mice, causing them to be more susceptible to SesT infection [<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The two main observations of this study were that influenza-induced type I IFNs created a dysbiotic gut microbiota and dampened inflammatory and antimicrobial responses in the gut, increasing susceptibility to SesT infection. Thus, the impact of type I IFN production may have broader impacts than previously thought.</p><p>Even though most recent evidence highlights the negative impact of type I IFNs in SesT infection, type I IFNs can also protect the host during infection with less pathogenic strains [<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>, <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>].

In more detail, <italic>F. tularensis</italic>-induced type I IFNs drive expression of transcription factor IRF1, that then causes expression of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) [<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. GBPs have multiple antimicrobial functions against intracellular pathogens including disruption of pathogen-containing vacuoles [<xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>, <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>].

However, it is still unknown how exactly <italic>F. tularensis</italic> DNA reaches the cytosol to initially signal via cGAS, IFI204, and STING.

Additionally, mice lacking the type I IFN receptor have improved disease outcome upon infection.

Furthermore, similar to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, type I IFNs are harmful to the host during <italic>B. abortus</italic> infection because in vivo infection of IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice shows decreased splenocyte apoptosis and decreased bacterial load [<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>].

However, to date, there are no intracytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors upstream of type I IFN production that signal via MyD88 and act together with STING or RNA Pol III.

The first documentation of potential pathways leading to production of type I IFNs during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection was conducted in human lung epithelial cells [<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. In these cells, type IV secretion-competent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is required for IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> production and bacterial control. Furthermore, induction of IFN-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> or B-DNA occurs downstream of IRF-3 and CARD-containing protein, IPS-1, but does not involve other CARD-containing proteins like RIG-I and MDA5 or the inflammasome protein, ASC [<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. These results are perplexing as no other CARD-containing proteins besides those investigated in this study exist that could explain how DNA is inducing type I IFNs via IPS-1.</p><p>In addition to DNA-dependent type I IFN production, RNA-dependent type I IFN production can occur as well. <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> can induce type I IFNs in an RNA-RIG-I-IPS-1-dependent manner [<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In contrast to the work done by Opitz et al. in a human epithelial cell line, DNA-induced type I IFNs do not require IPS-1, and RNA but not DNA is the primary inducer of type I IFNs in BMDMs [<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Furthermore, Pol III can transcribe <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> DNA into a RIG-I ligand.

Finally, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> CDNs are also sufficient for type I IFN production [<xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. The latter may be explained by cGAS and STING-dependent signaling as STING-dependent CDN stimulation and type I IFN production have been demonstrated [<xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. It is obvious that many different intracellular nucleic acid-detection pathways are activated during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection and results may depend on cell type.</p><p>Upon receptor binding and STAT signaling, type I IFNs induce macrophages to differentiate into classically activated inflammatory macrophages, which can produce nitric oxide.

In this model of type I IFN-induced STAT activation, STAT2 forms a complex with IRF9, which is unique from ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, IRF9) [<xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>].

While evidence in vitro suggests the importance of type I IFNs in restricting bacterial growth in macrophages, they may be dispensable during in vivo <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection [<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>, <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. These complex results and the multitude of signaling pathways engaged to induce type I IFNs during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection, illustrate the importance of understanding these cytokines during bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.8"><title>4.8. <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic></title><p>
<italic>C. burnetii</italic> is an intracellular pathogen of the lung and the cause of Q fever. Permissive subsets of alveolar macrophages and recruited monocytes are believed to be the primary cellular targets of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection [<xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. In these cells, <italic>C. burnetii</italic> inhabits the macrophage phagolysosome that is extensively modified by bacterial protein [<xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Interference with inflammatory proteins like TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> [<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>, <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 are hallmarks of infection with virulent <italic>C. burnetii</italic> [<xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. However, knowledge of the innate immune response during acute Q fever is still lacking. Our group recently determined that, despite the phylogenetic and pathogenic similarities between <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and <italic>C. burnetii</italic>, pathogen-induced type I IFNs affect the host differently [<xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. We determined that during <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection in mice, type I IFN production negatively impacted the host as displayed by decreased disease in IFNAR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. Yet the role of type I IFNs was tissue dependent. We compared peripheral to lung delivery of type I IFNs. The results indicated that peripheral delivery of IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> exacerbated disease, whereas IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> at the site of infection, in the lung, ameliorated disease. The negative impact of peripheral type I IFNs on the host was hypothesized to be due to the ability of type I IFNs to decrease inflammatory cytokine expression [<xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. At this time, the <italic>C. burnetii</italic>-derived ligands and pathways that are responsible for type I IFN induction are just beginning to be understood. <italic>C. burnetii</italic> encodes all but three proteins involved in the type IVB secretion system of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>; so, it is plausible that <italic>C. burnetii</italic> is sensed and induces type I IFNs in a manner similar to that of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> [<xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>C. burnetii</italic>-stimulated pDCs make IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and have upregulated expression of genes upstream of type I IFN production like <italic>TLR7/9</italic>, <italic>IRF7</italic>, <italic>MyD88</italic>, <italic>RIG</italic>-<italic>I</italic>, <italic>NOD1</italic>, and <italic>NOD2</italic> [<xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Thus, <italic>C. burnetii</italic> may induce production of type I IFNs in many ways, though pathways likely differ between cell types. Our results provide an excellent example of the need to assess the impact of type I IFNs on different tissue sites during bacterial infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Concluding Remarks</title><p>Type I IFNs are potent immunomodulatory signaling molecules and have the capacity to diversely affect immune responses. Our knowledge of these signaling molecules has expanded greatly since their discovery, and now, we know they are induced during intracellular bacterial infections and have a multitude of effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). The evolutionary importance of type I IFN production in this context is clear, as many intracellular bacteria have devised methods of co-opting type I IFN production for their benefit. Enhancing means of cell death and dampening inflammatory responses serve as excellent examples of this, but these effects could also benefit the host. The downstream effects of type I IFNs depend on the route of infection, which PRR signaling pathways are engaged, and the presence of virulence factors that allow for intracellular detection of bacterial components. In each of the intracellular bacteria reviewed here, there is no clear-cut evidence as to the effects of type I IFNs being only beneficial or only detrimental to the host. This is not surprising because minute differences in the magnitude of type I IFN protein expression and expression of IFNAR on cell surfaces can tip the balance and define the impact of type I IFNs. Thus, the web of type I IFN signaling is more complex than previously thought. When type I IFNs are part of the immune response in a given setting, everything from host genetics and health history to current disease state must be evaluated. It has been shown in mice that influenza A-induced type I IFNs increase mycobacterial growth and disease in coinfected animals [<xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Thus, secondary infections during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with pathogens that may induce type I IFNs could have a drastic impact on antimycobacterial host responses. Furthermore, treatment for <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection is an aggressive long term antibiotic regimen, and considering intratracheal delivery of type I IFNs is beneficial in a mouse model of disease, perhaps aerosolized type I IFNs may be an effective alternative to antibiotics [<xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>, <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Situations like this highlight the need for more detailed studies to better understand how, when, and why type I IFNs may benefit the host or pathogen. This may open new avenues of treatment options beyond antibiotics to combat intracellular bacterial infections.</p></sec>
