Although macrophages are armed with a battery of antimicrobial mechanisms, elimination of the intracellular bacilli from these cells is largely dependent on activation signals arising from CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A key role in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated macrophage activation can be attributed to IFN&#x003b3;, which helps in <italic>Mtb</italic> clearance by inducing iNOS expression and enforcing phagosome-lysosome fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Both human and animal studies have established that IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the key mediators of protective immunity against <italic>Mtb</italic>.

Since IFN&#x003b3; production depends on IL-12, deficiency in IL-12 receptor &#x003b2;1 (IL-12R&#x003b2;1) has also been shown to result in severe primary TB in the affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">One of the most important evidence supporting the protective role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells against human TB is provided by people suffering from HIV/AIDS.

Owing to the unrestricted growth of the bacilli, TB frequently affects extrapulmonary sites in HIV/AIDS patients, and can also occur in disseminated form in the severe cases. Similar to the case of HIV/AIDS, idiopathic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lymphocytopenia has also been shown to increase TB susceptibility and its associated mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mechanisms of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated protection against <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p id="Par16">Despite the long known role of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in protection against <italic>Mtb</italic>, its underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of IFN&#x003b3;-mediated protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> have largely focused on its effect on the infected macrophages. These studies have revealed that IFN&#x003b3;-activated macrophages eliminate the intracellular bacilli primarily by: (i) producing reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs), (ii) enforcing phagosome-lysosome fusion, and (iii) activating the autophagy pathway.</p><p id="Par17">Nitric oxide and other RNIs help in the clearance of the intracellular bacilli by inflicting oxidative damage on to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages, however, did not produce copious amounts of RNIs in the absence of activating signals. IFN&#x003b3; promotes iNOS expression in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages which catabolizes <sc>l</sc>-arginine into nitric oxide (NO), which in turn is used as the substrate to generate other RNIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Besides having a direct effect on intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic>, RNIs can also reduce the bacillary load by inducing apoptotic cell death in infected macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Apoptosis of infected macrophages is a protective response and is associated with diminished <italic>Mtb</italic> survival. As <italic>Mtb</italic>-containing apoptotic bodies are readily phagocytosed by dendritic cells, it also augments <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">One of the important strategies evolved by <italic>Mtb</italic> and other pathogenic mycobacteria to survive within infected macrophages is to inhibit phagosome maturation. By excluding vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, pathogenic mycobacteria inhibit phagosome acidification and escape the degradative action of lysosomal acid hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Studies with <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages have shown that IFN&#x003b3; signalling can activate these cells to enforce phagosome maturation and eliminate the intracellular bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Transcription of pH-responsive genes in IFN&#x003b3;-activated macrophages and attenuation of the acid-susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic> strains in the infected animals shows that IFN&#x003b3; signalling enables the infected macrophages to overcome phagosomal maturation block both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Autophagy was initially described as a cell survival mechanism during starvation. A plethora of recent studies has demonstrated that autophagy also plays a key role in protection against the intracellular pathogens including <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Antimycobacterial effects of autophagy have been attributed to enhanced killing of mycobacteria within the infected cells and reduced inflammation in the affected tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The genetic link between autophagy, inflammatory conditions, and TB susceptibility provides an important support to the role of anti-inflammatory and bactericidal properties of autophagy in protection against human TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. IFN&#x003b3; is a potent autophagy inducer in the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages and produces the cellular effects similar to that of starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

This section presents the clinical and experimental findings demonstrating the involvement of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in TB pathogenesis. Notably, the pathological character of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is predominantly manifested in a subset of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected immunocompetent adults and TB&#x02013;IRIS patients, wherein these cells exhibit excessive responsiveness to mycobacterial antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In immunocompetent adults, active TB develops from the reactivation of latent infection and primarily affects lung tissue. An overly intense IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response is the most important immunological parameter distinguishing the active disease from latent infection in these people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. On the contrary, the incompetence of host immune system to contain the bacilli is responsible for TB pathogenesis in young children and immunodeficient people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Classical evidence supporting the pathological role of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is provided by tuberculin skin testing (TST)&#x02014;a diagnostic test to examine <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure. TST involves the intradermal injection of purified <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens, followed by monitoring for the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction seen as local skin induration. As DTH is mediated by T<sub>H</sub>1-polarized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, a larger area of skin induration in TB patients demonstrates a strong association between IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the active disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In latently infected people, the area of skin induration has been found to correlate with the future risk of active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, an intense tuberculin reaction is considered as more serious and indicates the likelihood of the concomitant active disease or its future risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, it should be noted that lack of reactivity or anergy to <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens does not predict the resistance to active TB. As it signifies the lack of T<sub>H</sub>1 response to mycobacteria, anergy to mycobacterial antigens is associated with enhanced risk of morbidity and mortality in the infected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Studies aimed at characterizing the host immune response during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection further suggest the involvement of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in TB pathogenesis. These studies have shown the heightened levels of IFN&#x003b3; in lung tissue, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, pleural effusion, and lymph nodes of active TB patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. BAL fluid IFN&#x003b3; levels in active TB patients have been found to directly correlate with the disease severity and subsided with its successful treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These findings are supported by transcriptomic analysis of whole blood cells from TB patients and healthy controls by Berry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The authors have&#x000a0;observed an enhanced transcription of IFN&#x003b3;-inducible genes in active TB patients, compared with latently infected people and healthy controls. Consistent with enhanced IFN&#x003b3; levels, increased frequency of IFN&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during active TB has been reported by several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although most of these studies have shown the polyfunctionality of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB patients, the specific role of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in TB pathogenesis is evident from animal studies.</p><p id="Par23">Unequivocal support for the pathological role of IFN&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is provided by TB&#x02013;associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB&#x02013;IRIS). Affecting a subset of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV- and <italic>Mtb</italic>-coinfected people, TB&#x02013;IRIS occurs in diverse manifestations and poses a major challenge in the clinical management of HIV in these people. Mechanistically, the&#x000a0;ART-mediated decline in the viral load allows for the rapid expansion of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Both terminally-differentiated and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with specificity to <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens have been shown to expand in ART-treated HIV- and <italic>Mtb</italic>-coinfected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Exaggeration of antimycobacterial immunity (with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion) in the&#x000a0;ART-treated HIV- and <italic>Mtb</italic>-coinfected people is evidenced by their conversion from a &#x02018;negative&#x02019; TST status to a strongly &#x02018;positive&#x02019; one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

PD-1 is present on T lymphocytes and its engagement by PD-L1 results in the negative regulation of T cell functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As PD-L1 was found to be abundant in TB patients, researchers wondered over the outcome of PD-1 signalling during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and examined it using knockout mouse strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Surprisingly, it was observed that instead of developing resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic>, PD-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited significantly enhanced susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. Further analysis of TB pathogenesis in PD-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed that these animals mount an exaggerated IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response to the bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Besides PD-1, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells can also suppress the exaggerated IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response during mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In macaque model of TB, higher frequency of T<sub>reg</sub> cells has been observed in the animals who would develop the latent infection, compared with those that would develop the active disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These findings in PD-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and the macaque model demonstrate that aggravated IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response is the key mediator of TB pathology and that its inhibition prevents the reactivation of latent infection into the active disease.</p><p id="Par26">It is evident from the above-discussed findings that protective versus pathological character of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is defined by the degree of their responsiveness to <italic>Mtb</italic>. A hyperactive IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response to <italic>Mtb</italic> is pathological in nature and is frequently observed in adult TB patients. After initial exposure, most of the immunocompetent adults would contain <italic>Mtb</italic> infection without developing any disease symptom. This condition of asymptomatic <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, referred to as latent TB, represents the state of protection against the bacilli. Latent TB persists lifelong in most, but nearly 10% of the infected people who would develop active TB in their lifetime. As discussed above, reactivation of latent infection into the active disease can be attributed to aggravated anti-<italic>Mtb</italic> IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Similar aggravation of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses is to blame for TB&#x02013;IRIS development in a subset of HIV- and <italic>Mtb</italic>-coinfected people.

Neutrophils are frequently infected by <italic>Mtb</italic> and are abundant at the site of active disease. Although these cells may help in the containment of the bacilli during the initial phase of infection, their involvement in TB pathogenesis is supported by a number of studies. It has been shown that the frequency of neutrophils at the site of active disease correlates with the disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Higher neutrophil count (neutrophilia) is associated with low sputum conversion and poor TB prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Increased frequency of neutrophils at the affected site has also been demonstrated in susceptible mouse strains and their depletion from these animals resulted in the enhanced resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].

<italic>Mtb</italic>-infected neutrophils and macrophages are the potent producers of toxic molecules and matrix degrading enzymes, including elastases, myeloperoxidases, collagenases, and serine proteases.

MMP-9, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, is also abundant in active TB patients and is associated with poor prognosis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

It is likely that the combined action of this and above-discussed mechanisms leads to IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated TB pathogenesis in immunocompetent adults. The individual contribution of these mechanisms to the development of TB, however, awaits further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion and future perspectives</title><p id="Par31">IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the key orchestrators of antimycobacterial immunity. However, with increasing recognition of TB as a heterogeneous disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have also been implicated in TB pathogenesis. A more intense tuberculin reaction, which is driven by IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, is frequently observed in TB patients, and its intensity in latently infected people indicates the future risk of the active disease in them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Active TB patients exhibit enhanced IFN&#x003b3; levels in different tissues which correlate with disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In keeping with this, increased expression of IFN&#x003b3;-inducible genes has been observed in active TB patients, compared with latently infected people and healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The pathological face of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is also obvious in TB&#x02013;IRIS patients and its animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Enhanced susceptibility of PD-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse strains, which mount heightened IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to <italic>Mtb</italic>, further support the pathological role of these cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Disrupted granuloma vascularization and/or neutrophil- and macrophage-mediated dismantling of granuloma architecture are important mechanisms of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated TB pathology.</p><p id="Par32">Owing to earlier studies demonstrating the protective role of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, vaccinologists had been aiming to boost IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response as a strategy to TB immunoprophylaxis. Unfortunately, these strategies have failed to confer significant protection against human TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Failure of rationally designed vaccines against human TB and the dual role of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection call for retrospection of our approach to TB vaccination. It is imperative that instead of boosting antimycobacterial immunity, researchers must attempt to dampen the IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in susceptible immunocompetent adults to prevent TB in them. Likely success of these approaches against human TB is suggested by animal studies.</p><p id="Par33">Conclusively, a significant volume of scientific data demonstrates that, besides conferring protection against <italic>Mtb</italic>, IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also play a key role in TB pathogenesis in immunocompetent adults. As adult TB represents the major burden of the disease, there is an urgency of legitimate efforts to evaluate the immune-dampening approaches in these patients. Not only these approaches can improve treatment outcome against the active disease, they are also likely to help in the effective management of drug-resistant TB, which has emerged as a major challenge for the clinicians.</p></sec>
