<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death due to an infectious agent, and continues to pose a global health challenge worldwide. About one-third of the world&#x02019;s population is estimated to be exposed to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),</italic> with a majority of individuals carrying the bacilli in a latent form. In 2014 alone, approximately 9.6 million people were estimated to have acquired TB, resulting in 1.5 million deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Over time, <italic>Mtb</italic> has evolved several immune evasion strategies that enable it to reside successfully in the host, resulting either in the manifestation of active disease or latent infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> It has been well recognised that the outcome of infection is a result of complex dynamics between the host and the pathogen, triggering a series of signalling cascades and cross-talk among various molecular components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> The importance of several innate immune responses in clearing tuberculosis infection has been well established, although their relative contribution in a quantitative sense towards mounting adequate adaptive immune responses still remain poorly understood. Decades of genetic and biochemical experimental studies on TB have identified many important factors that contribute to a disease phenotype,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> with studies reporting genetic polymorphisms in pattern recognition receptors such as, the mannose receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and Toll-like receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> several cytokines, chemokines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>

<italic>VDR</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> as well as the identification of genetic loci associated with increased risk to TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Independent analyses have identified processes of both innate and adaptive immune responses as well as metabolic processes to be significantly implicated in the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> However, biological systems are inherently interconnected and interdependent, and rarely will an alteration in a single gene or gene product directly result in disease. Disease states are in fact representations of perturbations in the underlying complex interdependent molecular networks. It is thus important to adopt a systems approach to address this fundamental complexity. These approaches result in novel emergent properties that are difficult to comprehend without considering the whole system.</p><p>Recent years have seen a surge in the availability of <italic>omics</italic> data for the host in TB at different levels, furthering our understanding of factors that influence predisposition to disease and markers that correlate with disease severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> An integrated analysis of insights obtained from multiple levels in the <italic>omics</italic> chain can collectively shed light on changes that are effectively translated from the genome and how they affect functions at the molecular level, thereby providing a comprehensive and integrated perspective on the myriad changes that occur upon infection, as well as on subsequent therapeutic intervention, paving the way towards personalised medicine.</p><p>Among the different levels in the host <italic>omics chain,</italic> exhaustive coverage has been provided by the increased availability of transcriptomic screens in TB across different populations as well as in multiple cell and tissue types, including patient whole-blood samples, isolated dendritic cells and neutrophils, and from macrophage cell lines exposed to <italic>Mtb</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> These studies have established that blood transcriptomics offers a robust approach for studying the immunology of TB and lends itself to integrated systems analysis to determine host responses in infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> The increasing availability of gene expression data across different geographical locations makes collective analysis of different datasets necessary in order to gain deeper insights into the host&#x02019;s specific response to TB. However, such collective analysis is met with multiple challenges, and the measured signals in each study are heavily influenced by individual experimental design, depending largely on the sensitivity of the probes used in different platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Heterogeneity among and between population samples studies coupled with experimental biases further compounds the problem of comparing different datasets describing TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Transcriptomic studies of TB patients and their corresponding healthy controls shed light on differentially regulated genes [differentially expressed genes (DEGs)], and also permit monitoring of such differential regulation upon treatment. However, DEG-centric approaches cannot explain the underlying mechanisms behind the observed differential regulation by themselves, nor do they explain the functional consequences of such expression in a systematic manner.</p><p>Analysis of host networks provides a useful alternative to study molecular responses across multiple data platforms, enabling the integration of different types of <italic>omics</italic> data and providing a platform for visualisation and interpretation of changes triggered upon perturbations such as infection. The causes and consequences of differential regulation can be traced by monitoring the interactions of DEGs in the network. Previously, we established a methodology to construct response networks by integrating macrophage expression data into a protein&#x02013;protein interaction network, and highlighted the &#x02018;highest activities&#x02019; in the host macrophage upon infection with <italic>Mtb</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> While the pathway activities in the macrophage during infection provide insights into the initial innate responses of the host, the immune response to TB is complex and involves multiple players of both innate and adaptive immunity, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T cells, as well as several metabolic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Whole blood captures a pool of immune cells that are trafficking to and from the sites of active disease and lymphoid organs, and serves as an easily accessible medium for analysis.</p><p>In this study, we describe a meta-analysis of multiple host response networks generated by integrating whole blood expression profiles from TB patients across different studies in order to find common disease-specific variations in an unbiased manner, resulting in the emergence of a unified network, which we refer to as the <italic>common core,</italic> reflective of the set of consistent changes in the host in TB. Such an approach overcomes platform-dependencies of individual microarray datasets, shifting focus from DEGs alone towards a more comprehensive analysis of the processes that are consistently altered, thereby shortlisting important molecular players that drive the host outcome upon infection. We observe the occurrence of the <italic>common core</italic> in an independent dataset, further strengthening the analysis. The core also shows variation in activity over the course of anti-tubercular therapy, and a comparison with the response networks of other inflammatory diseases such as pneumonia, sarcoidosis, Still&#x02019;s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) reveals that the <italic>common core</italic> is a largely specific response to TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The overall approach implemented in this study and an overview of the results are illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Workflow adopted in this study.

A comparison of these networks led to the identification of a <italic>common core</italic> highly active in disease. The significance of this <italic>common core</italic> was assessed on an independent microarray dataset generated for the Indian Cohort, and its specificity to tuberculosis was determined by monitoring its variation over treatment as well as by comparing similar response networks generated for other inflammatory diseases Sarcoidosis, Pneumonia, Still&#x02019;s disease and SLE, collectively termed as OD</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41540_2017_5_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e519"/></fig>

The transcriptomic datasets for meta-analysis were chosen such that they were from (a) whole-blood expression profiles generated through microarray experiments of (b) adult TB patients, (c) and have at least a few age-matched controls in the same dataset. Although there are a few more datasets listed for tuberculosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> several of them were from PBMCs and were therefore not considered to eliminate any bias due to differences in the source tissue. Those datasets that compared TB transcriptomes with other diseases, but not with healthy controls were also not considered. The 5 datasets chosen for this work have been utilised in several studies and are well cited, and have led to significant insights into the host response to tuberculosis, making them well suited for meta-analysis. The first question to ask of this data was to identify the set of genes that were consistently differentially regulated in TB patients across all datasets. Surprisingly, a comparison of DEGs across datasets showed very little overlap, with only seven genes commonly up-regulated or down-regulated across all five datasets considered (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Such limited overlap could be a result of multiple factors, including differences in severity of infection, genetic heterogeneity among and between population groups analysed, as well as variations in the infecting strains in addition to platform-based dependencies for individual datasets.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Transcriptome datasets used in this study.

</p><p>To understand the significance of such poor overlap despite a large number of DEGs reported in each study, we first carried out a clustering exercise for each dataset separately by considering the normalised signal intensity values for these DEGS in each patient and each healthy control individually within the dataset. A hierarchical clustering was then performed using standard protocols, which by and large yielded distinct clusters for healthy and TB samples in each case, replicating the observations reported in each study. Given this, we investigated if DEGs in different datasets represent the same set of biological processes and whether they represent different points of perturbation leading to the same functional destinations. We therefore performed individual gene set enrichment analyses for these DEGs, which revealed similar processes that are differentially regulated in TB across all datasets, implying that while each study may not report the same DEGs, they may highlight different DEGs belonging to common functional categories. (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The DEGs computed for individual datasets, their overlap as well as the commonly enriched biological processes across these DEGs have been provided in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Response networks capture disease-induced variations in an unbiased fashion</title><p>To test whether the processes enriched in disease across datasets are indeed related alterations, or if the different datasets have neighbourhoods of alterations that are common, we employed a networks-based approach and compared the top-ranked alterations in different datasets. First, a comprehensive curated, well annotated, global human protein&#x02013;protein interaction network (hPPiN) was constructed, accounting for several signalling, metabolic and regulatory processes, thus providing a global coverage into the human protein interactome. The master network comprised 17,062 proteins (nodes) and 208,759 interactions (edges), of which 168,237 edges had an assigned direction based on their functional annotations, while the remaining 40,522 edges were considered bidirectional as they represent formation of structural complexes. The individual interactions in the network along with network statistics have been listed in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S2</xref>.</p><p>To obtain insights about the functional significance of variations in expression in disease, the base network was rendered condition-specific by mapping gene expression data in the form of node and edge weights in the hPPiN. Each node was assigned a weight proportional to the expression value of that gene in a particular condition, and the corresponding edge weights were inversely proportional to the weights of the node forming that edge, such that a lower-edge weight implied a higher expression value of the constituting nodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Identification of high activities in these weighted networks was posed as a problem of computing shortest paths in each of the condition-specific networks. Shortest paths among all nodes in the networks were computed using Dijkstra&#x02019;s algorithm, which computes a shortest path for each given source node to a target node by traversing the lowest-weighted edges in that route. Path cost is taken as the cumulative sum of the weights of the edges constituting the path (Eq.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">4</xref>). Lower the path cost, higher is the perceived activity through that path. Since condition-specificity is brought about by variations in the weights on essentially the same blue-print, it is feasible to identify differences in routes or paths in the networks between healthy and disease. Differences in paths of high were thus mined in an unbiased fashion by identifying shortest paths with least path costs. The methodology utilising weighted networks has been previously demonstrated to be significantly robust to noise generated by minor variations in differential expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and the rationale for computing weighted shortest paths has been discussed in Supplementary File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p><p>Ten condition-specific networks were constructed, representative of five TB and five healthy conditions. In each of these networks, the set of paths representing highest levels of activities were first identified, which were then used to find active paths of highest difference in TB compared to their corresponding controls. We refer to these highest activity difference networks as &#x02018;response networks&#x02019;, since they reflect a systems view of the differential response observed in disease.</p><p>A total of 94,886,628 all-vs.-all shortest paths were computed for all conditions. The path cost formulation was devised such that paths with the least cost were considered to be most active, expected to contain highly expressed genes. A percentile-based ranking was adopted to rank paths, with lower cost paths attaining higher ranks. Two thresholds were considered to represent tiers of activity&#x02014;paths in the 99.5th percentile were considered to be of highest activity (Tier-1), while those in the 99th percentile were considered to be of high activity (Tier-2), and were inspected for further analysis. While paths below this threshold could still be significant and their exclusion may result in the elimination of important genes, for purposes of identifying the most significant responses, we lay emphasis on the high activity paths alone, thereby erring on the side of caution. Both Tier-1 and Tier-2 paths were compared across the condition-specific networks for HC and TB, and paths unique to each TB network were considered. These unique highest activity paths in TB are now representative of the most active difference responses occurring in patients.</p><p>The nodes in the TB response networks expectedly comprise genes that are upregulated in disease, but in addition they also include those genes that are constitutively expressed and which form mediating &#x02018;bridges&#x02019; among such upregulated genes, thereby providing mechanistic insights into the nature of the flow of such differential regulation in the host, which would otherwise be missed if the focus was on DEGs alone. Interestingly, we observe that the Tier-1 response networks for each TB dataset comprises a well-connected subnetwork of the hPPiN, implying that the differences observed are interrelated in some sense and possibly lead to a concerted set of variations as a collective response to disease.</p><p>Pooling the individual TB response networks by taking a union of the Tier-1 activities for individual datasets reveals the nature of the overlap among different datasets. The network topology is largely dependent on the degree or connectivity of each node, and nodes with a higher degree will be situated towards the centre of the network. As observed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, the nodes present in only 1 dataset (<italic>grey</italic>) align at the periphery of the network, and increasing overlap of nodes in multiple response networks correlates with a more central positioning of the genes. The nodes that are present in all five response networks (<italic>red</italic>) are seen to be localised at the centre of the cumulative network, forming interconnected edges. The topological architecture of the pooled network thus points to a central core subnetwork of genes that is likely to drive the host responses in active tuberculosis, independent of the population cohort analysed. It is thus apparent that the DEGs in different datasets, although not identical, belong to common neighbourhoods in interaction networks. Analysis of such a subnetwork would thus lead to deeper insights into the primary processes that are regulated in the host in TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Emergence of an active interconnected &#x02018;<italic>common core&#x02019;</italic> in disease</title><p>Comparison of different response networks reveals a higher overlap among nodes, in contrast to the comparison of DEGs alone, suggesting that despite limited commonalities observed at the individual gene level, the response networks can capture multiple similarities in biological processes and participating nodes. To identify the individual interactions driving such similar processes across datasets, the computed shortest paths for individual tier-1 TB response networks were compared, and a set of 713 common pathways was identified. These paths constitute an interaction network comprising 380 nodes and 467 edges, which we refer to as the <italic>common core</italic>. The <italic>common core</italic> is seen to be largely interconnected with only a few sparse edges, implying extensive cross-talk across multiple nodes that contribute to the molecular response in TB. To assess the probability of emergence of the <italic>common core</italic> out of chance, a permutation test was carried out as described in the Methods. The distribution of the overlap between randomly picked genes and the <italic>common core</italic> genes revealed that the maximum overlap with the <italic>common core</italic> in all the 10<sup>^5</sup> random selections was 6%, clearly showing the probability of picking up these genes just by chance is very low.</p><p>As seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, the <italic>common core</italic> is largely centred around <italic>STAT1</italic>, a transcription factor that primarily mediates pro-inflammatory responses as well as links other important signalling processes in the host.

Subsequently, the activation of anti-inflammatory processes mediated by cytokines IL-4 and TFG-beta is also observed. Complement and coagulation cascades are seen to be at play along with other signalling processes such as Kit receptor signalling and Notch Signalling pathways, as well as natural killer cells-mediated cytotoxicity, characteristic of tubercular infection. Cytoskeletal remodelling is actively observed, and can be attributed to structural changes in the cell during phagocytosis of <italic>Mtb</italic> along with leucocyte endothelial migration involved in the activation of T cell responses by chemokines secreted from macrophages and dendritic cells towards lymph nodes.

Interestingly, while <italic>STAT1</italic> also emerges in the Tier-1 network in pneumonia, it makes a different set of interactions in pneumonia as compared to tuberculosis.

A DEG-centric approach alone may not necessarily be suggestive of disease pathology nor can it reveal general patterns of variation in the system. A network approach is useful to probe if the different sets of DEGs ultimately culminate in the modulation of the same functional modules. Monitoring the variations in the interacting partners of DEGs in the context of their interaction networks would facilitate such an analysis. Large scale networks typically used for studying biological systems can be broadly classified into two types&#x02014;gene expression correlation networks and <italic>protein&#x02013;protein</italic> interaction networks. The former, which is more frequently represented in current literature, reflect associations between gene-pairs whose expression patterns are correlated. The latter, on the other hand capture interactions between proteins that can lead to deciphering flows, of which biochemical or signalling pathways form classic examples. Approaches such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> show the commonalities in modules between the different datasets but rely on networks based on co-expression patterns. The network reported in this study is based on high-confidence, physical interactions that have been experimentally verified bearing evidences in literature. A drawback of the protein-interaction networks, however, is that they are limited in coverage by the availability of interaction data. There could also be noise in the direction information, since directions may be condition-specific in some cases, whereas the networks will include data from multiple experiments. Nevertheless, the networks have been useful in obtaining a global perspective of variations in disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> leading to increased usage of protein interaction networks. Protein&#x02013;protein interaction networks on their own suffer from the limitation of providing only a static picture of the system at a given time. However, integrating such networks with transcriptome or proteome data derived from patient samples for example, and if available over the course of disease or even treatment progression, will render the networks condition-specific, thereby providing a dynamic view of global changes in the system.</p><p>Networks intrinsically have the advantage of placing the nodes in their functional contexts and facilitating the tracing of pathways leading to a given biological goal. If different datasets contain variations in the participating nodes at different points in these pathways, they can be easily captured in the networks. In the <italic>common core</italic>, pro-inflammatory responses modulated by interferons via <italic>STAT1</italic>, and apoptotic responses among others, are highly enriched although the points of alteration may not be exactly the same across individual datasets. While the DEG overlap among different datasets was minimal, we observe the occurrence of several genes such as <italic>AIM2</italic> and <italic>ID1</italic> which are not upregulated in all datasets, and hence they do not intersect, but are present in the <italic>common core</italic> as they have a common regulator in <italic>STAT1</italic>. The approach can thus highlight common regulators that mediate infection-induced responses. It must be pointed out that the formulation does not impose connectivity at any stage.</p><p>Many studies have suggested the importance of Type-1 interferon system in response to TB. Similarly, the involvement of the <italic>STAT1</italic>-<italic>VDR</italic> interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and the importance of Complement Signalling have also been noted earlier. In addition, many new genes are identified in these networks that vary in two or more datasets and linked to the same functional modules. The networks are thus able to capture the entire set of perturbations in an unbiased manner in a single analysis. More importantly, the new finding in this study is the identification of these modules as the common minimal determinants of TB infection. Thus, a networks approach identifies a set of genes that are pathologically most important, providing important pointers for use in diagnosis and therapy. Upon anti-tubercular treatment, the <italic>common core</italic> shows variation, again emphasising their relevance to disease, and genes belonging to the common repressed network emerge in the response network 6 months&#x02019; post treatment, signifying reversals in activity. The <italic>common core</italic> is also fairly specific to TB and differs from the corresponding response networks generated for similar inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Many routes are identified by this approach, and some of these could be newly identified pathways, while many are rewired routes in disease as compared to healthy controls. Future studies which could follow up on some of these shortlisted routes in the laboratory and obtain some experimental support, would lead to the identification of newer biological pathways. Such an integrated approach thus provides a platform-independent foundation to attain maximum insights from available clinical data in a systematic, unbiased manner, and sheds light into the molecular characterisation of the host response to perturbations such as infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Dataset selection and processing</title><p>Whole-blood microarray profiles of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis with corresponding healthy controls were obtained from five different studies reported in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) representing multi-platform data.

The scanned images were analysed with Feature Extraction Software 10.7.3.1 (Agilent) using default parameters to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended Processed Signal intensities. The data was processed using the limma package in R where it was log2 transformed and quantile normalised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The computational pipeline adopted in this study to generate response networks is available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AbhinandanD/RNG.git">https://github.com/AbhinandanD/RNG.git</ext-link>).
