Worldwide, over a million people die of TB annually, and millions more currently live with the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Successful treatment requires months of antibiotic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and drug-resistant strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) continuously emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Approximately a third of the world&#x02019;s population is estimated to be infected with MTB, but most are asymptomatic. While these naturally resistant individuals are able to avoid active disease, MTB might persist in a dormant state, known as latent TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, approximately 10% of individuals will develop active TB after infection with MTB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to predict if an individual is susceptible. While twin and family studies have indicated a heritable component of TB susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have only identified a few loci with low effect size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Due to the highly polygenic architecture, it may be informative to examine differences between susceptible and resistant individuals at a higher level of organization, e.g. gene regulatory networks. Using this approach, previous studies have characterized gene expression profiles in innate immune cells isolated from individuals known to be susceptible or resistant to infectious diseases, including those with latent or active TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and acute rheumatic fever<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">We hypothesized that gene expression profiles in innate immune cells may be used to classify individuals with respect to their susceptibility to develop active TB. To test this hypothesis, we differentiated dendritic cells (DCs) from monocytes isolated from individuals that had recovered from a past episode of active TB, which we refer to as susceptible, and from individuals with confirmed latent TB, which we refer to as putatively resistant (this group is enriched in resistant individuals but we cannot exclude that some still have the potential to develop active TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>). We infected the DCs with MTB because these innate immune cells help shape the adaptive immune response, which is critical for fighting MTB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We discovered that the gene expression differences between innate immune cells from resistant and susceptible individuals were present primarily in the non-infected state, that these differentially expressed genes were enriched for nearby SNPs with low p-values in TB susceptibility GWAS, and furthermore, that these gene expression levels could be used to classify individuals based on their susceptibility status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Susceptible individuals have an altered transcriptome in the non-infected state</title><p id="Par4">We obtained whole blood samples from 25 healthy male Caucasian individuals (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

We isolated dendritic cells (DCs) and treated them with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) or a mock control for 18&#x02009;hours. To measure genome-wide gene expression levels in infected and non-infected samples, we isolated and sequenced RNA using a processing pipeline designed to minimize the introduction of unwanted technical variation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). We obtained a mean (&#x000b1;SEM) of 48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6 million raw reads per sample.

As expected, there was a strong response to infection with MTB in both resistant and susceptible individuals (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Considering the putatively resistant individuals, we identified 3,486 differentially expressed (DE) genes between the non-infected and infected states at a q-value of 10% and an arbitrary absolute log-fold change greater than 1.

In both classes of samples, the DE genes included the important immune response factors <italic>IL12B</italic>, <italic>REL</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>. While the treatment effect was obvious in all individuals, of most interest were the patterns of gene expression differences between the putatively susceptible and resistant individuals in either the non-infected or infected states (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

To do this, we intersected our data with results from TB susceptibility GWAS conducted in Russia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, The Gambia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, Ghana<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and Uganda and Tanzania<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We also included data from a height GWAS conducted in individuals of European ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> as a negative control. To perform a combined analysis of our gene expression data and the GWAS results, we had to define pairs of genes (for which we have expression data) and SNPs (for which we obtained GWAS <italic>P</italic> values). Thus, each gene in our expression data was coupled with the GWAS SNP with the lowest p-value among all tested SNPs located within 50&#x02009;kb of the gene&#x02019;s transcription start site (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>; this gene-SNP definition was performed separately for each GWAS data set).</p><p id="Par7">Once we defined gene&#x02013;SNP pairs, we asked whether differences in gene expression levels between putatively resistant and susceptible individuals could help us identify genetic variation that is associated with susceptibility to TB. In other words, we asked whether increasing evidence for DE genes is associated with low GWAS p-values. To do so, we calculated the fraction of SNPs with a GWAS p-value lower than 0.05 among SNPs that were paired with ranked subsets of genes whose expression profiles show increasing effect size of expression differences between putatively resistant and susceptible individuals. In order to assess the significance of the observations, we performed 100 permutations of the enrichment analysis to derive an empirical p-value.</p><p id="Par8">Using this approach, we observed a clear enrichment (empirical <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) of low p-values for TB GWAS SNPs that are paired with genes that are differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant individuals in the non-infected state (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

We focused on the gene expression levels measured in the non-infected state both because this is where we observed the largest gene regulatory differences between putatively susceptible and resistant individuals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,c</xref>), and also because, from the perspective of an ultimate translational application, it is more practical to obtain gene expression data from non-infected DCs. We trained a support vector machine using the 99 genes that were differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible individuals in the non-infected state at a q-value less than 5% (see Methods for a full description of how we selected this model). Encouragingly, we observed a clear separation between putatively susceptible and resistant individuals when comparing the predicted probability of being susceptible to TB for each sample obtained from leave-one-out-cross-validation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Using a cutoff of 0.25 for the predicted probability of being susceptible to TB, we obtained a sensitivity of 100% (5 out of 5 susceptible individuals classified as susceptible), a specificity of 88% (15 out of 17 resistant individuals classified as resistant), and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 71% (5 of 7 individuals classified as susceptible were susceptible).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Classifying TB susceptible individuals using a support vector machine model.

</p><p id="Par10">Unfortunately our current data set is too small to properly split into separate training and testing sets (it is challenging to collect samples from previous TB patients, who are healthy and have no medical reason to go back for a GP visit). To our knowledge, there are also no other suitable data sets available with which to test out classifier (that said, see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S17</xref> for the results of applying the classifier to a non-ideal data set, which measured gene expression in macrophages from a small number of individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>). Thus, in order to further assess the plausibility of our model, we applied the classifier to data from an independent study, which collected genome-wide gene expression levels in DCs from 65 healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, none with a previous history of TB. Using the cutoff of 0.25 for the probability of being susceptible to TB (determined to be optimal in the training set), 11% (7 of 65) of the individuals were classified as susceptible to TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Adjusting for the PPV obtained from the training set (71%), our model predicted that 7.7% of the healthy individuals were susceptible. While we cannot confirm this result (the true susceptibility status of these 65 individuals is unknown), this observation is encouraging because our estimate is similar to the commonly used inference that roughly 10% of the general population is susceptible to progression of infection from latent to active TB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par11">We obtained dendritic cells (DCs) from individuals that were known to be putatively susceptible or resistant to developing active tuberculosis (TB) and measured genome-wide gene expression levels in non-infected DCs and DCs infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) for 18&#x02009;hours. As expected, there were large changes in gene expression due to MTB infection in the DCs from both putatively resistant and susceptible individuals (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). We identified 645 genes which were differentially expressed (DE) between susceptible and resistant individuals in the non-infected state; whereas, we did not observe any DE genes between susceptible and resistant individuals in the infected state (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This suggests that the differences in the transcriptomes between DCs of resistant and susceptible individuals are present pre-infection. Yet, 18&#x02009;hours after infection gene expression profiles in both susceptible and resistant individuals have converged to a similar gene regulatory network, presumably to fight the infection. We confirmed that the absence of DE genes in the infected state is not caused by a decrease in statistical power due to an overall increase in gene expression variance upon infection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). We chose to measure gene expression 18&#x02009;hours post-infection because this time point was previously associated with a large change in genome-wide gene expression levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Given our observations, however, future studies investigating the difference in the innate immune response between individuals resistant and susceptible to TB may want to focus on earlier time points post-infection.</p><p id="Par12">It is important to note that our study was not designed to uncover the mechanisms underlying susceptibility or resistance to TB, but to try and find a gene regulatory signature that might allow us to classify individuals as either susceptible or resistant. That said, among the 645 DE genes between resistant and susceptible individuals in the non-infected state, there were many interesting genes involved in important innate immune activities critical for fighting MTB and other pathogens such as autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, phagolysosomal acidification, and antigen processing. In particular, <italic>FEZ2</italic>, a suppressor of autophagosome formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, was down-regulated when DCs were infected with MTB; however, in the non-infected DCs, this gene has elevated expression level in susceptible compared with resistant individuals. In turn, <italic>ATP6V1B2</italic>, a gene coding for a subunit of the proton transporter responsible for acidifying phagolysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, has increased expression in susceptible individuals compared to resistant in the non-infected state. Lastly, genes coding for nine subunits of the proteasome, which is critical for processing of MTB antigens to be presented via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, have increased expression in susceptible individuals compared to resistant in the non-infected state. These genes are candidates for future functional studies investigating the mechanisms of TB susceptibility.</p><p id="Par13">We observed that DE genes in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental system were enriched for lower GWAS p-values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This suggests that such <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches are informative for interrogating the genetic basis of disease susceptibility. That being said, we recognize a major caveat with this analysis is that assigning SNPs to their nearest gene on the linear chromosome is problematic because regulatory variants can have longer range effects. Nevertheless, considering this limitation, it was encouraging that we were able to detect evidence of the genetic basis of TB susceptibility in this system.</p><p id="Par14">Not only did this analysis identify a global enrichment of TB susceptibility loci, but by intersecting the expression and GWAS data, we were able to identify a few interesting candidate genes, which were only marginally significant in the differential expression analysis (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) and in the original GWAS (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Here we highlight two genes (<italic>CCL1</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic>), which have been previously implicated in the response to MTB infection. <italic>CCL1</italic> is a chemokine that stimulates migration of monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In our study, it was upregulated in susceptible individuals compared to resistant in both the non-infected and infected states (but did not reach statistical significance in either) and was statistically significantly upregulated with MTB treatment. Furthermore, the nearby SNP assigned to <italic>CCL1</italic> had a p-value less than 0.01 in the TB susceptibility GWAS from The Gambia and Ghana. A previous differential expression study of TB susceptibility (discussed in more detail below) found that <italic>CCL1</italic> was upregulated to a greater extent 4&#x02009;hours post-infection with MTB in macrophages isolated from individuals with active TB (i.e. susceptible) compared to individuals with latent TB (i.e. resistant)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally they performed a candidate gene association study and found that SNPs nearby <italic>CCL1</italic> were associated with TB susceptibility. In our previous study, we discovered that <italic>CCL1</italic> was one of only 288 genes that were differentially expressed in macrophages 48&#x02009;hours post-infection with MTB and related mycobacterial species but not unrelated virulent bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>UNC13A</italic> is involved in vesicle formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In our study, it was downregulated in susceptible individuals compared to resistant in both the non-infected and infected states (but did not reach statistical significance in either) and was statistically significantly upregulated with MTB treatment. Furthermore, the nearby SNP assigned to <italic>UNC13A</italic> had a p-value less than 0.01 in the TB susceptibility GWAS from Russia, The Gambia, and Ghana. In our past study mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in DCs 18&#x02009;hours post-infection with MTB, <italic>UNC13A</italic> was one of only 98 genes which were associated with an eQTL post-infection but not pre-infection, which we called MTB-specific eQTLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus our new results increased the evidence that <italic>CCL1</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic> may potentially impact TB susceptibility.</p><p id="Par15">Previous attempts to use gene expression based classifiers in the context of TB have focused on predicting the status of an infection rather than the susceptibility status of an individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In other words, the goal of most previous studies was to detect individuals in the early stages of active TB when antibiotic intervention would be most effective or to monitor the effectiveness of a treatment regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In contrast, our goal was not to distinguish between active and latent TB, but instead to be able to determine susceptibility status before individuals are infected with MTB. Even with our small sample size, we were able to successfully train a classier with high sensitivity and reasonable specificity. Because such a classification of susceptibility status could affect the decision of whether or not to take antibiotics to treat latent TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, false negatives (susceptible individuals mistakenly classified as resistant) would be much more harmful than false positives (resistant individuals mistakenly classified as susceptible). For that reason, we emphasized sensitivity over specificity.</p><p id="Par16">While the small sample size was the main concern in interpreting the classifier results, we recognize multiple other potential caveats of our study design. First, because the cells used in the experiments were collected from Caucasians, it is unknown if the classifier would perform well when applied to other human populations. Second, because the classifier focused solely on the transcriptional response of the host immune cell to infection with MTB H37Rv, it may not be suitable for the detection of differences in susceptibility with respect to other, more or less virulent MTB strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Third, because the susceptible individuals had already experienced active TB, it is possible that their innate immune cells retained memory of the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. If this innate immune memory affected how the monocytes differentiated into DCs in response to cytokine stimulation, or in general affected gene regulation, this would drastically change the interpretation of our results.</p><p id="Par17">With respect to the third caveat, while we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of trained immunity, we do not believe there is sufficient evidence to support this possibility in our case. Innate immune memory is known to be a short-term phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, its affects may be erased when immune cells are moved to a new microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and the whole blood transcriptional signature of active TB disappears 6&#x02013;12 months after the initiation of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, the GWAS enrichment results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) suggest that trained immunity cannot explain our observations. Indeed, the differences in gene expression between susceptible and resistant individuals in the non-infected state were enriched for low p-values from TB susceptibility GWAS. This observation cannot be explained by possible downstream consequences of experiencing active TB because enrichment of DE genes in GWAS data supports a causal relationship. In other words, if most of the DE genes we observed could be explained by trained immunity, one would not expect these genes to be associated with susceptibility to the disease. That said, we recognize that the ideal study would be a long-term prospective design in which blood samples were obtained from a large cohort of individuals prior to MTB infection.</p><p id="Par18">To our knowledge, our study was only the second to collect data from <italic>in vitro</italic> MTB-infected innate immune cells isolated from individuals known to be putatively susceptible to MTB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, there were substantial differences between our study and that of Thuong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. First, they derived and infected macrophages, the primary target host cell in which MTB resides; whereas, we derived and infected DCs, which play a larger role in stimulating the adaptive immune response to MTB. Second, we collected samples from a larger number of putatively resistant individuals (19 versus 4), increasing our power to distinguish between the gene expression profiles of susceptible and resistant individuals. Third, they measured gene expression with microarrays; whereas, we used RNA-sequencing. Considering the substantial technical differences between the methods used and the biological differences between DCs and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, unsurprisingly, we were unable to identify the susceptible individuals from Thuong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> using our classifier (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S17</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Indeed, at this time, we are not aware of any other data set from healthy individuals known to be susceptible to TB, with which we can further test our classifier. When we applied our classifier to an independent set of non-infected DCs isolated from healthy individuals of unknown susceptibility status, our model predicted that 7.7&#x02013;11% of the individuals were susceptible to TB, which reassuringly is similar to the average in the general population (10%). Despite this, our results must be interpreted cautiously; at best as a proof-of-principle, due to our very small sample size of only 5 susceptible individuals. That said, our promising results in this small study suggest that collecting blood samples from a larger cohort of susceptible individuals would enable building a gene expression based classifier able to confidently assess risk of TB susceptibility. By reducing the number of resistant individuals receiving treatment for latent TB, we can eliminate the adverse health effects of a 6 month regimen of antibiotics for these individuals and also reduce the selective pressures on MTB to develop drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par20">We recruited 25 subjects to donate a blood sample for use in our study.

To perform a combined analysis of the gene expression and the summary statistics from each GWAS, we assigned each gene to the SNP with the minimum GWAS p-value out of all the SNPs located within 50&#x02009;kb up or downstream of its transcription start site. Specifically, we obtained the genomic coordinates of the SNPs with the R/Bioconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> package SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP144.GRCh38 and matched SNPs to nearby genes using GenomicRanges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. 10,265 to 11,060 of the 11,336 genes were assigned an association p-value depending on the GWAS (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). For each of the 4 differential expression contrasts we tested (resistant vs. susceptible individuals in the non-infected state, resistant vs. susceptible individuals in the infected state, effect of treatment in resistant individuals, effect of treatment in susceptible individuals), we also performed an enrichment analysis. To do so, we calculated the fraction of genes assigned a GWAS SNP with p-value less than 0.05 for bins of genes filtered by increasingly stringent cutoffs for the observed differential expression effect size (the absolute value of the log fold change). The effect size cutoffs were chosen such that on average each subsequent bin differed by 25 genes.

Second, because the dynamic range obtained from RNA-seq (current study) and microarrays (previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) were different, we normalized the gene expression levels to a standard normal (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) distribution (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>; note however that this strategy is unable to correct for the inability of microarrays to accurately quantify genes with expression levels that result in fluorescence levels below the background level or above the saturation limit).

Specifically, we tested for differential expression between susceptible and resistant individuals in the non-infected state and identified sets of genes to use in the classifier by varying the q-value cutoff.

To assess the results of the model on the training data, we performed leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV). In order to choose the model with the best performance, we calculated the difference between the mean of the LOOCV-estimated probabilities of being TB resistant for the samples known to be TB resistant and the corresponding mean for the samples known to be TB susceptible. This metric emphasized the ability to separate the susceptible and resistant individuals into two separate groups. Using this metric, the best performing model was the support vector machine with the 99 genes that are significantly differentially expressed at a q-value of 5% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13</xref>, Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>); however, both the elastic net (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S14</xref>) and random forest (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S15</xref>) had similar performance.

For evaluating the predictions on the test set of individuals with unknown susceptibility status, we used a relaxed cutoff of the probability of being TB susceptible of 0.25, which was based on the ability of the model at this cutoff to classify all TB susceptible individuals in the training set as susceptible with only 2 false positives.
