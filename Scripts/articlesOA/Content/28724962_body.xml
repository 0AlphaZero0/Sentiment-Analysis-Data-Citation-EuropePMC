In fighting the epidemic, it is of great concern that the detection rate for pediatric TB is only 35%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The gold standard for a diagnosis of pulmonary TB is growth of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) from respiratory specimens. Since 2010, the use of the Xpert MTB/RIF on sputum samples has been implemented rapidly in low- and middle income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, serving as a point-of-care test (POC-test) with improved diagnostic accuracy in adults compared to direct microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, in children, the Xpert MTB/RIF has clear limitations because of the paucibacillary nature of disease and the difficulties in obtaining representative specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The majority of pediatric TB cases are therefore diagnosed through clinical scoring systems with obvious shortcomings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> related to the nonspecific nature of signs, symptoms and radiological findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and growing evidence for reduced sensitivity of the interferon-gamma release essays (IGRAs) and the tuberculin skin test (TST) in young and malnourished children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although over-diagnosis can occur, under-diagnosis is more common, contributing to morbidity, death and masking the true burden of pediatric TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Little attention was paid to pediatric TB by public health authorities until WHO declared pediatric TB a neglected area and called for research to address the lack of adequate diagnostics for children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, encouraging in particular biomarker research to fill this gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, preferably differentiating children with TB from symptomatic non-TB cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The search for TB biomarkers based on analyses of human gene expression has received increasing attention, but data in children remains limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A landmark study by Anderson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> using genome-wide analysis of RNA expression in whole blood (WB) in three cohorts of African children discovered a 51-transcript signature from which they derived a risk-score distinguishing TB from other diseases. Similarly, Verhagen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> found a 116-gene signature and identified a 5-gene set that discriminated TB disease from non-TB pneumonia in Warao-Amerindian children. The findings from these genome-wide analyses were remarkably different; no genes overlapped between the 51- and the 116-transcripts. In the search for consistency in human gene expression related to TB pathology across age groups and national borders, Sweeney <italic>et al</italic>. applied gene expression data from publically available microarray repositories, using three discovery datasets from adult TB to identify a 3-gene combination, that separated TB from other diseases in two datasets from children, and in one dataset from adults, with a mean AUC of 0.83 for the three cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Studies based on genome-wide analyses of transcriptomes are expensive and extremely resource-demanding and tend to generate large biomarker signatures (which might be difficult to reduce to clinically practical tests), but represent important steps towards a POC-test for TB, adding novel, un-biased information of expression of genes with relevance to TB risk and pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

This technique has excellent abilities for profiling host biomarkers in larger sample sets, with a dynamic range and accuracy comparable to qPCR, requiring small amounts of RNA per sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Based on the knowledge gained from multiple genome-wide analyses, we aimed to find more defined transcriptional signatures in unstimulated WB of Indian children, with the ability to separate TB cases from young children symptomatic for other reasons, resembling a real-life diagnostic setting in India, the country carrying the greatest share of the global TB burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Source population</title><p id="Par6">This study is cross-sectional and draws on WB samples from two prospective clinical studies (A and B) previously conducted in India (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In the present study, we have applied knowledge derived from a range of previous genome-wide analyses to identify two smaller transcriptional biomarker signatures in WB of Indian children, comprising 7 and 10 transcripts, performing with high diagnostic precision despite the poor nutritional status and young age of many participants. Notably, the signatures meet to a large extent the requirements for a diagnostic POC-test according to the WHO-defined target product profile (TPP):<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> first, they are non-sputum based and identified in WB. Second, with a sensitivity of 91.7% for all TB cases in the test set, and 100% for definite TB, they perform far better than the proposed &#x02265;66% target for culture confirmed TB. Third, they can potentially differentiate TB disease from <italic>Mtb-</italic>infection. In comparison, the Xpert MTB/RIF has a sensitivity of 68.8% for culture confirmed TB when performed on gastric lavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, given the paucibacillary nature of pediatric TB disease, culture of gastric lavage/induced sputum misses true disease in about 70% of cases, suggesting that the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF might be as low as 21% in this group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The identified signatures could provide a major improvement with regards to sensitivity and availability of samples (WB), if translated to a POC-test, possibly by using technology similar to the Xpert MTB/RIF. The 7- and 10-transcript signature provided a specificity in the test set of 80.8% and 88.5%, respectively. This does not reach the recommended specificity of &#x02265;98% for a POC-test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but might be further improved by including additional or alternate genes.</p><p id="Par40">Whereas most gene expression studies are performed in adults in Africa, the present study is conducted in children in India, thereby providing novel knowledge, as gene expression is likely to differ with regard to age, as well as genetic and environmental background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In this regard, Verhagen <italic>et al</italic>. found that in adults from South Africa, Gambia and the United Kingdom, their signature discriminated TB disease from latent TB, but the signatures identified in these cohorts, did not have the same ability in their own pediatric cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This indicates that transcriptional signatures identified in adults cannot always be extrapolated to children. Notably, the signature dominated by type- I interferon-inducible genes identified in adults by Berry <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> had poor discriminatory power in the Warao-Amerindian children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, whereas the findings by Anderson <italic>et al</italic>. supported up-regulation of these genes in children with TB disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In the present study, 2 of the 5 genes common between the two signatures, i.e. <italic>GBP5 and IFITM1/3</italic>, supports the importance of type-1 interferon signaling in pediatric TB disease. <italic>GBP5</italic> was also present in the signatures identified by Anderson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and part of the 3-gene signature identified in the comprehensive multicohort analysis by Sweeney <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, as the gene-combination most predictive of TB disease. In children, the mean sensitivity achieved by this 3-gene combination was 86% for culture confirmed TB vs. latent TB. This highlights the performance of the signatures for definite TB in our study.</p><p id="Par41">In studies of this kind, it is not possible to be certain of the identity of the TB index case, or to determine if TST-positive HHCs are recently or long-term infected. These different states could affect their expression profiles. However, given the combination of their young age and documented exposure to a sibling with TB, we consider recent infection to be the most plausible explanation. To gain some insight into outcomes, 33 of the 36 HHCs were traced 3.5 years after study-closeout. Only 2 of these developed TB disease; a TST positive child developed pulmonary TB one year after study participation, and a TST negative child developed extrapulmonary TB 3 years after participation. Both children were classified as not having TB by the signatures. Though the sample size is small, this suggests that the biosignatures identify TB disease, and not asymptomatic TB infection.</p><p id="Par42">The relatively small number of TB cases and controls, particularly in the test set, represent a limitation to the study, warranting exploration and validation in other, larger cohorts. Moreover, the signatures do not meet the WHO recommendations for a POC-test with regards to specificity, and the fact that steps towards such a test still remain, represents a rationale for presenting both signatures in the present exploratory study. The 10-transcript signature yielded somewhat higher diagnostic precision, and includes the highest number of genes, all possible candidates for a future POC-test signature. The strength of the 7-transcript signature lies in the initial logistic regression step, reducing possibilities for overfitting. The consistency of having 5 genes in common strengthens the relevance of both signatures. Future exploration could include the investigation of performance for all 12 biomarkers combined, but this will warrant alternate or modified statistical approaches. Partly because our previous studies were limited to a panel of 48 biomarkers, and also due to some overlap of the study subjects selected for the studies, we consider future exploration of the present expanded gene panel more informative and stringent, than testing the performance of previously identified biomarkers signatures in the current study.</p><p id="Par43">Nevertheless, the novel signatures support findings of genes with relevance to TB-pathology identified in our recent biomarker signature study. In this study, <italic>CD3E</italic> and <italic>TGFBR2</italic> were part of a biosignature separating TB cases from asymptomatic HHCs, and <italic>MMP9</italic> was significantly upregulated in TB cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This study also showed that differences in biomarkers signatures were most apparent between the most polar clinical groups of the TB disease spectrum, corresponding to 100% sensitivity for the signatures for definite TB, in the test set of the present study. We acknowledge that randomization of TB cases resulted in 40% definite TB in the training set vs. 70% in the test set, but we judged the total number of TB cases and size of each group to be of greater importance, than a 50/50 distribution of definite TB cases between the training and the test set.</p><p id="Par44">Further, despite adjustment for age in all steps of the analyses, we cannot rule out residual confounding; that the ability of the signatures to separate TB cases from symptomatic non-TB cases in the test set is not related only to the absence or presence of TB disease, but might be influenced by age-dependent gene-expression, as the mean ages differed between the groups. However, the 10-transcript signature correctly classified the 5 of 6 TB cases &#x0003c;2 years, and the 7-transcript signature correctly classified 4 of 6. Although our numbers are too small for definite conclusion in this particular age group, and exploration in larger populations is needed, these findings speak in favor of the age-independent, discriminatory abilities for TB disease of the identified signatures.</p><p id="Par45">With regards to confounding, underweight is a feature well recognized to contribute to TB, but also to be a result of this disease. The design of our study does not enable us to decide whether the signatures are influenced by nutrition status, but accurate separation of TB cases from controls in both training and test set, regardless of the unequally distributed BMI between the control groups, speaks against nutrition status as an important confounder. Further, both control groups contain TST positive and negative individuals. Although this lack of uniformity could be viewed as a limitation, this is indeed reflective of real-life clinical practice, where a POC-test must have the ability of separating TB cases from other children seeking health-care, regardless of their TST-status.</p><p id="Par46">In conclusion, we have applied knowledge gained from multiple genome-wide analyses, by targeting promising genes identified in these studies, using the novel, accurate and inexpensive dcRT-MLPA, which provides a platform more easily transferable to a future POC-test. We have identified small, consistent biomarker signatures with solid abilities to discriminate TB cases from asymptomatic HHCs. Further, in the study cohort, these signatures also proved to be powerful tools in discriminating TB cases from children with symptoms from other causes, reflective of the situation encountered in real-life clinical practice. We have confirmed findings of others in an Indian population that differs with respect to age, genetic background and environment. Altogether, this study provides additional insight into gene expression in pediatric TB disease, and contributes to optimism for future non-sputum based POC-diagnostic tools for pediatric TB.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="Par47">The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study, are available from the corresponding authors on request.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
