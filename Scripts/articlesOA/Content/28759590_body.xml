Soil transmitted helminth infections are among the most common infections, transmitted <italic>via</italic> soil contaminated by eggs excreted from human faeces [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Of note, helminth infections are co-endemic in many geographic areas endemic for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), HIV-1 and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Therefore, co-infections of helminths with <italic>Mtb</italic>, HIV-1 and/or <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> occur in a large proportion of the subjects [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is a facultative intracellular organism, obligate aerobe, infecting primarily lungs <italic>via</italic> the aerogenic route [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been recently estimated that 1.7 billion people are infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> among which 5&#x02013;15% will develop tuberculosis disease (TB) [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To date, the only vaccine available to prevent TB disease consist of an attenuate strain of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>, the Bacillus of Calmette et Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG). While BCG immunization protects from life-threatening disseminated forms of TB disease in children, its efficacy in adults is inconsistent [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The protective components of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immunity are partially defined. Several studies have underscored the essential role of IL-12/IFN-&#x003b3; axis in the protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, an efficient CD4 T-cell response probably associated with type 1 cytokine secretion is associated with the control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, since a severe reduction in the CD4 T cell number during HIV infection or the suppression of their function following anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy are associated with increased risk of TB reactivation [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The current paradigm of human cellular immunity indicates that functionally-distinct CD4 T-cell populations are specifically involved against a variety of pathogens depending on their size and their intra- or extra-cellular localization. In this model, type 1 helper CD4 T cells (Th1 cells) intervene against viruses and intracellular pathogens, Th2 cells against parasites such as worms and Th17 cells against extracellular pathogens [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] including bacteria and fungi [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consistent with this paradigm, the protective <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cell response is usually ascribed to typical Th1 response with CD4 T cells producing cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; or TNF-&#x003b1; that contribute to the recruitment of monocytes and granulocytes and activate the anti-microbial activity of macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. By contrast, helminth infections induce IL-4/IL-5 and IL-13 producing CD4 T cells and regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] associated with the alternative activation of macrophages for repair of tissues injured upon migration of worms across different body compartments [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Since helminths and <italic>Mtb</italic> are co-endemic in several regions of the world, including Tanzania [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we hypothesized that ongoing helminth infection may influence and potentially modulate the functional profile of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cell responses. Our hypothesis is founded on the observations that helminths stimulate Th2 type immune responses and previous studies that demonstrated that the cytokine micro-environment may influence, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, the functional profile of antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we provide evidence that a significant proportion of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells in patients with active TB disease from TZ have a Th2 cytokine profile as indicated by the production of IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 and expression of the Th2 cell lineage transcription factor Gata-3. <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T-cells comprised Th1 and Th2 cells with a polyfunctional cytokine profile, and the increased frequency of Gata-3<sup>+</sup> memory CD4 T cells was associated with reduced frequency of T-bet<sup>high+</sup> memory CD4 T cells. Interestingly, <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells in patients with active TB disease from SA had a typical Th1 profile encompassing single IFN-&#x003b3; and dual IFN-&#x003b3;/TNF-&#x003b1; cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that active TB disease induced the generation of mixed Th1/Th2 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells in patients from TZ whereas a typical Th1 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cell response was generated in patients from SA. Further investigations would be needed to determine whether TB-uninfected individuals from TZ and SA harbor different basic response to TB antigens.</p><p>These observations are of high interest since the assessment of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T-cell cytokine profile is consistently proposed to allow the discrimination between active and latent <italic>Mtb</italic> infections [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].

Indeed, reduced capacity to produce IL-2 is usually associated with high antigen load, persistent T-cell stimulation, expression of co-inhibitory molecules and differentiation towards effector memory and/or terminally differentiated effector memory [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Interestingly, CD4 T cells coexpressing IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; and harboring a phenotype of effector-memory response were associated with active tuberculosis in HIV-uninfected [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and HIV-infected TB patients [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Of note, polyfunctional helminth-specific CD4 T-cell responses were also recently associated to helminth biological activity [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned above, the study hypothesis was that helminth infection might influence the functional profile of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells. In this context, about 67% of patients from TZ either had an ongoing active helminth infection or had evidence of previous helminth exposure/infection. However, about 11% of the patients from SA also showed a positive serology for previous helminth exposure/infection with helminth but no sign of generation of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific Th2 CD4 T cells. Despite this discordance between positive serology for helminth exposure and lack of the generation of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific Th2 CD4 T cells in patients from SA, we cannot exclude that the frequency and/or severity of helminth re-infection/exposure in patients from TZ is higher as when compared to South African patients and therefore responsible for the mixed Th1/Th2 functional profile of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005817.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

Interestingly, this proportion was significantly reduced (about two fold) in the presence of ongoing helminth infections. These results provide additional evidence that helminth infections may significantly influence the generation of distinct T cell subsets in active TB disease.

Interestingly, statistical analyses revealed that elevated serum levels of IFN-&#x003b2; were associated with elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th1 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells lacking IL-2 co-production. These IFN-&#x003b2; serum levels were inversely correlated with polyfunctional <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4 T cells and Th2 cytokines detected by polychromatic flow cytometry and in cell culture supernatants. Based on these findings, the so far unappreciated role of IFN-&#x003b2; (and type I IFNs in general) in coordinating TB specific immunity needs to be further explored.</p><p>The role of Th1, Th2 and CD8 T cells in the control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and the progression of TB disease is under intense debate.

The role of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8 T cells is however still controversial.
