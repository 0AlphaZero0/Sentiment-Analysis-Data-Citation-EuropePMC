<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral blood as a minimally invasive source has been widely used in biomarker discovery for many diseases. Due to the richness in gene expression information, blood transcriptome has become a primary source for blood-derived biomarkers. In a pioneering work, unsupervised clustering of transcriptome data was able to separate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with high accuracy[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Blood transcriptome studies have also been applied to several solid tumors, including the early detection of breast cancer[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], stage classification of colorectal cancer[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], prognosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and gene signature for treatment response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Due to the direct link between blood and the immune system, many studies on the blood transcriptome have been focused on infectious or autoimmune diseases. A major concern in biomarker discovery is the reproducibility in independent studies. To obtain reliable biomarkers, different approaches have been reported in the literature. For example, clustering of differentially expressed genes followed by machine learning have been applied to the discrimination of three subclasses of septic shock [<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, machine learning approaches are prone to over-fitting if not carefully utilized. To achieve better reproducibility in independent studies, a two-stage design may be applied on multiple datasets, where the model derived from the discovery datasets are validated in additional independent datasets. In one such study, a panel of 11 genes were found to be able to discriminate sterile inflammation from infectious inflammation[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another way to enhance the prediction power is to use gene modules rather than individual genes, which has demonstrated good performance on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other diseases[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of biomarker, we could also select genes consistently dys-regulated in multiple independent studies on different diseases, which further reduce the likelihood that the observed gene dys-regulation is due to population heterogeneity or transient fluctuation. We hypothesized that similar immune response may be induced in peripheral blood in different infectious and autoimmune diseases, or even in other diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This similar immune response will be reflected on the dys-regulation of certain critical genes for immune response in blood cells. Due to the high consistency of dys-regulation in different diseases, these genes may serve as reliable biomarkers for a variety of health conditions. Along this line, Gibson and coworkers have proposed a total of 90 &#x0201c;blood informative transcripts&#x0201d; which consist of ten representative genes from each of the nine axes[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, we are interested in finding a much smaller set of genes which can be conveniently assayed with low cost while preserving rich information on health status.</p><p>Since much broader range and higher level of gene dys-regulation had been reported in the blood for infectious and autoimmune diseases compared to other diseases, we mainly focused our investigation on infectious and autoimmune diseases in this work. Indeed, we found high consistency of gene dys-regulation for a limited number of genes in infectious and autoimmune diseases. Based on the co-dysregulation pattern in viral and bacterial infections, we selected 20 representative genes, 10 for each category. Common gene dys-regulation in different diseases may suggest similar underlying mechanism of immune response. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential application of these genes in clinical practice, including disease classification, prognosis and monitoring of treatment effect. In addition, the potential application to the monitoring of personal health may also be of great interest to the general public.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data collection</title><p>We collected public datasets on blood transcriptome from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We mainly focused on microarray datasets on infectious and autoimmune diseases or cancer (solid tumor). For the discovery stage, we collected 20 datasets on infectious or autoimmune diseases for gene selection (<bold>Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182294.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>). Only one representative dataset on the whole blood transcriptome was chosen for each disease, preferably with sample size greater than 20 in both case and control groups. These included 4 datasets[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for bacterial infections and 4 datasets[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for viral infections.

For the validation stage, we collected 34 additional datasets on infectious or autoimmune diseases or cancer (<bold>Table E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182294.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>). For datasets with similar experimental design, we generally selected the ones with larger sample size and higher quality (defined below).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Quality control</title><p>For all the blood transcriptome data, normalization and quality control were performed to filter out the low quality data as follows. The logarithmic values of expression data were first calculated. Next, the probes with greater than 50% missing values or low expression values (&#x0003c; <italic>log</italic><sub>2</sub>(100)) were removed. Furthermore, for all the remaining data points, the expression data with value below <italic>log</italic><sub>2</sub>(100) was set to a baseline value <italic>log</italic><sub>2</sub>(100). Finally, the expression value for genes with multiple probes was calculated as the mean logarithmic value of signal intensity for all probes assigned to the gene.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Gene selection</title><p>For each of the 20 datasets for the discovery stage, we conducted gene differential expression analysis based on rank product after data normalization[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We further applied stringent cutoff based on fold change (FC) to select differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with FC&#x0003e;2.0 or FC&#x0003c;0.5. A more lenient cutoff with FC&#x0003e;1.5 or FC&#x0003c;0.7 was also applied to select more genes for consideration. The choice of median over mean in FC calculation was to reduce the effect of genes with large deviation from the group median.</p><p>All DEGs in the 20 datasets were ranked by the number of times with FC&#x0003e;2.0 or FC&#x0003c;0.5. We found that down-regulated genes were not as consistently dys-regulated in the 20 datasets as the up-regulated genes. From the top-ranked genes, we further selected 10 genes frequently up-regulated in viral infections, and another set of 10 genes frequently up-regulated in bacterial infections (<bold>Tables B &#x00026; C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182294.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>). The gene selection procedure is as follows: first, the 55 genes with FC&#x0003e;2.0 or FC&#x0003c;0.5 in at least 8 of the 20 datasets were selected as candidates. For the selection of genes in viral infection, these 55 genes were ranked based on mean FC in the 4 datasets for viral infections and the top 10 genes were selected, all of which turned out to be interferon signaling genes. For the selection of genes in bacterial infections, the 5 genes with mean FC&#x0003e;8.0 in the 4 datasets for bacterial infections and another gene with FC&#x0003e;2.0 in 13 of the 20 datasets were selected. For the genes with mean FC between 5 and 8, only the 5 genes with FC&#x0003e;2.0 in at least 10 of the 20 datasets were considered, which summed up to 11 genes. To deselect one of the bottom two genes with similar mean FC, <italic>TLR5</italic> was chosen over <italic>GYG1</italic> to reflect the importance of TLR signaling pathways in immune response. These 20 genes were then applied to disease classification, prognosis and treatment follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Generation the FC matrix of the 20 genes for the 34 validation datasets</title><p>In order to classify the diseases in the validation datasets using the 20 genes, we first extracted the expression value of the 20 genes in each dataset. All the samples in these datasets were labeled as either <italic>control</italic> or <italic>case</italic>. The median value of expression within the <italic>control</italic> group was used as the reference for each gene. The choice of median over mean in FC calculation was to reduce the effect of genes with large deviation from the group median. The differential expression value of a gene was defined as the logarithmic expression value subtracted by the reference value of the gene. Next, the FC matrix was generated, the element of which was two to the power of the differential expression value.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Disease discrimination using K-means models</title><p>For the discrimination of viral and bacterial infections, K-means model was used on each dataset (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182294.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).

Collectively, both VRGs and BRGs were specific to the corresponding infection type because these genes had much lower FC in the other type of infection.</p><p>To further demonstrate the functional connections among the 20 genes, we conducted co-expression analysis on the top 55 genes with FC&#x0003e;2.0 in at least 8 of the 20 datasets (<bold>Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182294.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>).

In both burn and injury, significant up-regulation of BRGs was observed, which could be partially induced by secondary infection after burn or injury. In addition, down-regulation of several VRGs were observed in burn and injury, which was clearly different from other diseases examined here. Significant up-regulation of VRGs was also observed in scleroderma and primary Sj&#x000f6;gren's Syndrome (pSS). On the other hand, significant up-regulation of BRGs was observed in malaria. In addition, moderate up-regulation of a few BRGs was also observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Overall, these 20 VRGs and BRGs were frequently dys-regulated in many infectious and autoimmune diseases. The distinctive patterns observed here may deserve further investigation in future studies.</p><p>We shall note that we did not observe much gene dys-regulation in some of the datasets we examined for infectious or autoimmune diseases, including uremia, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Due to the limited number of datasets available for these diseases, we may need to wait for more datasets with high quality before a convincing conclusion can be drawn for these diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Potential applications of these 20 genes as biomarkers for infectious and autoimmune diseases</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Viral vs bacterial infections</title><p>To test whether these 20 genes could be used in distinguishing viral infections from bacterial infections, we collected four datasets containing both types of infections.

Some other top-ranked genes in SLE were also dys-regulated in multiple datasets of other diseases examined in this study. Therefore, we did not observe a single gene specifically dys-regulated in SLE with high confidence. In fact, we found that it was difficult to identify disease-specific genes for viral infections and autoimmune diseases with the gene dys-regulation pattern of viral infections in the original 20 discovery datasets.</p><p>We then used sepsis as another example to examine the issue of disease-specific gene. Among the three datasets for sepsis (<bold>Table G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182294.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>), we found 141 genes consistently dys-regulated in all three datasets (<bold>Table I in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182294.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>).

With the increasing availability of high quality datasets for various diseases, this issue of disease-specific genes may be re-examined in the future. In a recent work, deconvolution of cell composition was applied to the blood transcriptome data for the discovery of disease-specific genes[<xref rid="pone.0182294.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

We explored whether the relative expression level of the 20 genes as compared to the house-keeping genes can be used in disease classification, prognosis and treatment evaluation.

In an ideal scenario, there are multiple high quality datasets for each disease and every dataset has at least 100 samples for each study group (such as case and control groups). However, this requirement can not be fulfilled at the current stage, which may affect the ranking of high frequency gene dys-regulation. To partially alleviate the problem, we restrict our selection of datasets to only those of direct human sources. This means that the blood samples were profiled without any <italic>in vitro</italic> treatments. Blood transcriptome studies on animal models were also excluded entirely. Nonetheless, some hidden factors may still exert effect on the data analysis. For examples, the use of antibiotics, smoking, alcohol drinking, and insufficient sleep may all confound the data analysis. The selection of only commonly dys-regulated genes under diverse health conditions may partially reduce the noise but certainly not all. In sum, we share bear these limitations in mind when evaluating the results presented in this work.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec033"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, we have demonstrated that a small set of 20 genes displayed frequent and significant dys-regulation in infectious and autoimmune diseases. Biomarkers based on these commonly dys-regulated genes are likely more robust and reproducible than those biomarkers from a few limited studies. In combination with other disease-specific assays, these genes may assist in disease classification, patient stratification, prognosis and treatment follow-up. These genes may also be used in personal health monitoring. More works are warranted to explore its application in clinical practice and to elucidate the exact role of each gene in immune response. In practice, we would suggest the selection of a few VRGs and BRGs to monitor immune dys-regulation, in addition to the selection of a few potential disease-specific genes from previous studies. This way we could investigate at medium to large scale how the immune system is involved in the disease mechanism and whether certain VRGs or BRGs could become biomarkers for the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182294.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Major expression datasets and lists of selected differentially expressed genes, Table <bold>A</bold>, The discovery datasets: 20 datasets for infectious or autoimmune diseases.
