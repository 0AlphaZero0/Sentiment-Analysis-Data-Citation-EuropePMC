The reason is the fact that blood cells are altered in disease and can reflect the condition and state of different organs and tissues [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, the study of the interaction of blood cells with medicines can provide us with an early indication of the effect of a certain therapy on the human body. For instance, erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBCs) have been used as disease models for assessing drugs as they are sensitive to many disorders, including diabetes, Wilson&#x02019;s disease and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, neutrophils have been analysed to obtain information about the diagnosis, mechanism of action and therapy of different diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, allergic reactions or tumours [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, lymphocytes have shown to be altered in lung diseases, inflammatory processes leading to allergic diseases, during atherosclerotic plaque development, in cardiovascular diseases and during tumour progression [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Metabolomic profiling is a comprehensive method that allows the quantification of a large number of different metabolites in a single analysis in a non-targeted way that can provide useful information to study disease and the effect of treatments.[<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopy has proven fast and reproducible for obtaining good quality structural and semi-quantitative information about the metabolome of cells [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Metabolic profiling of cells has been previously applied to a wide range of <italic>in vitro</italic> models to help gain insight into basic and disease metabolisms, especially in combination with genomics and/or proteomics data [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although some studies about the metabolic profile of blood cells can be found, to our knowledge, very limited data about blood cell analysis by NMR spectroscopy from patients available [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The analysis of the metabolic profile of blood cells could not only provide a method for identifying new biomarkers for disease diagnosis, but also for in vivo evaluating the effects of new therapeutic treatments (e.g., nanomedicines) at a patient level [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Nanomedicine is the application of nanotechnological systems to medicine. The impact of this technology has augmented dramatically over the last few years due to its applications (drug delivery, prevention of drug metabolisation, diagnostic agent, etc.) [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thanks to its advantages, to date several nanometric systems have been approved for human use, and more than 240 are in different clinical trial phases. This situation creates the need to implement a wider range of methodological tools to optimize the design of new nanomaterials in early stages of their development and to assess their effect during clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Blood is one of the first environments that comes into contact with a nanomedicine when it is injected or when it enters the bloodstream via other administration types, which makes the study of the interaction of nanoparticles with different blood components highly relevant. Comprehensive studies have been reported on the effect of nanomaterials on both the immune and coagulating systems. They include the analysis of the impact of these compounds on the morphology, cell cycle and proliferation of different types of blood cells [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Indeed, new nanomaterials are designed to make this interaction as controlled and advantageous as possible, and blood cells have even been employed as carrier cells for nanoparticles to reach their destiny more efficiently [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this context, the focus of our study was to evaluate the potential of metabolomics by NMR to characterize the metabolic profile of peripheral blood cells before and after treatment with nanoparticles. To test our approach, we have chosen gold nanoparticles as model systems, because they are one of the most promising nanomedicines, that have been suggested for a wide range of different applications; e.g., medical imaging and therapies in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases or diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. One of its most promising properties is its capacity to eliminate an excess of oxidant species generated in stress situations (antioxidant behavior), which is beneficial for many biomedical applications. Most of these applications involve a direct contact with peripheral blood, whose impact can be evaluated by our method. Several approaches have been proposed to maintain the structure of gold as nanoparticles and to prevent agglomeration by adjusting their properties for biomedical applications. For instance, to increase their biocompatibility and activity against oxidative stress, gold nanoparticles have been supported on ceria nanoparticles or assembled in chitosan [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A wide range of different medical applications, including glucose sensors, antifilarial and antibacterial agents, have been proposed for these modified gold nanoparticles, however none of them has entered clinical trials yet. Both materials have their advantages and disadvantages, for instance, ceria particles are soluble at physiological pH, which is not always the case for materials coated with chitosan, that sometimes need an acid pH at higher concentrations. On the other hand, ceria materials can agglomerate or form crowns with proteins, compromising their bio-distribution, with is minimized in chitosan derived materials. To our knowledge, no apoptotic toxicity has been described for either of these gold nanoparticles. However, no coherent information can be found about their effect on cell viability and proliferation. While some works have found no impact in this regard, other studies have described a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation for both materials [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The reason for these divergent results may be variation in the size, shape or net charge of nanoparticles, important features than have been well described to cause different effects on cells [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In this context, the development of new biomedical methodologies to monitor effects of nanoparticles, which can provide a better understanding of the mechanism related to certain therapeutic and/or toxic effects, may contribute to the optimized design of these materials. Specifically, in the case of functionalized gold nanoparticles, for which a wide range clinical applications have been proposed that are waiting to be transferred to clinics, a previous evaluation step of their effect on peripheral blood cells could provide a fast and effective filter before starting any clinical trial.</p><p>In our work, we first optimized a global protocol to analyze the metabolic profile of the three main types of blood cells (erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and mononuclear leukocytes (PBMCs)) that can be isolated in parallel from one patient sample. The cell fractions from different healthy volunteers (n = 4) were then separately exposed to nanoparticles based on gold, and stabilised on ceria nanoparticles or chitosan, with antioxidant properties. The metabolomic profile of the treated cells was thereupon compared with the profile of the untreated control cells. With this proof of concept, we intended to show that systematic metabolic changes can be detected in peripheral human blood cells after treatment with nanoparticles. This information can contribute, together with other toxicological studies or therapeutic data, to evaluate new nanomedicines in preclinical phases from a translational point of view, establishing a precedent in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p>Solvents and reagents were purchased from: Sigma-Aldrich (Ficoll-Paque Plus, Ficoll-Paque Plus, PBS, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, L-glutamine, chitosan, HAuCl<sub>4</sub>, sodium citrate, AgNO<sub>3</sub>, sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate), Scharlab (methanol, chloroform, acetone, sodium hydroxide), Gibco (RPMI 1640 medium), Rhodia (CeO<sub>2</sub>), and Eurisotop (deuterated water, deuterated chloroform, deuterated trimethylsilyl propanoic acid, trimethylsilane).

To this end, peripheral blood was extracted from healthy individuals and the three mayor blood cell fractions (RBCs, PMNs and PBMCs) were separated. Two different methods were tested for evaluating the separation of the different fractions: the Ficoll-Paque gradient method, and dextran followed by the Ficoll-Paque gradient method. No significant differences in the quality of the metabolomic profile obtained using both procedures were found. Therefore, the Ficoll-Paque gradient method was selected for its simplicity and minimal sample handling. Another important factor to consider is that erythrocytes are particularly fragile, so they must be centrifuged at a lower speed without acceleration or braking.</p><p>After achieving phase separation, cells were submitted to treatment with nanoparticles (see details in the Supplementary Information). Three different concentrations of cells were tested: 30, 15 and 5 M/mL. Agglomeration and cell death was observed at the two higher concentrations (30 and 15 M/mL), but not at the lowest concentration (5 M/mL). Finally, cells were harvested and subjected to an extraction process with methanol, chloroform and water, a method that had been successfully applied in previous metabolomics studies [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This process is extremely sensitive to the elimination of metabolites from the medium that could interfere with the analysis, a process that was achieved by washing with PBS. Furthermore, cold methanol (-20&#x000b0;C) was added to effectively quench the metabolism of cells. Solvent amounts were optimised to 500 &#x003bc;L methanol (added directly after cell harvesting), 650 &#x003bc;L of chloroform (added in two times, before and after cell breakage) and 400 &#x003bc;L of water (added after cell breakage, to avoid ice-building during the freeze-thaw cycles) per 20 million cells. Smaller solvent volumes produced poorer extractions yields and a less efficient phase separation, while bigger volumes showed no improvement. As a result of the extraction, two different, aqueous and organic, fractions were obtained with polar and non-polar metabolites, respectively.

Simultaneously, a drop in lactate was observed, probably reflecting a reduced glucose conversion (main energy source in neutrophils) into lactate, in parallel with an increased insertion of pyruvate into the oxidative citric acid cycle. These cells have been reported to use glycerol-phosphate for energy production in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Thus, antioxidant materials could have activated glycerol-phosphate oxidation in mitochondria, a process that would explain the observed reduction of glycerol levels. In this situation, the observed increase of betaine levels, a known osmolyte, could compensate the decrease of gycerol levels [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Another important observation was the decrease in glutamine levels, revealing an alteration in glutaminolysis, a process that occurs at high rates in immune system cells [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>In general, the antioxidant impact of the nanoparticles was less pronounced in PBMC cells than in PMN cells, an indication perhaps of the fact that lymphocytes already rely on an oxidative metabolism for energy production. Also in this case, a drop in glycerol and an increase in betaine upon AuChi treatment were observed, but these effects did not take place for AuCeO<sub>2</sub>. The decrease in phosphocholine derivatives, glycerides (AuChi) and MUFA, PUFA and cholesterol (AuCeO<sub>2</sub>) could also be indicative for an alteration in the glycerophospholipid metabolism of PBMCs (Table E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182985.s004">S4 File</xref>).</p><p>Metabolic changes induced by nanoparticles on erythrocytes were less pronounced, a process that could be explained by the fact that these cells do not possess organelles, (e.g., mitochondria), the main target of the antioxidant properties of the gold nanoparticles. RBCs already possess a strong antioxidant system to protect the Hemo group, so minor antioxidant effects cannot be easily detected. Therefore, erythrocytes may be optimal sensors for a strong antioxidant or oxidative effect, but this was not the case for either material employed herein. Nevertheless, higher ATP levels were detected upon both treatments, a process that could reflect an altered energetic metabolism of the cells induced by the gold nanoparticles. Also amino acid metabolism seemed to be affected after treatment with AuCeO<sub>2</sub>, while AuChi seems to interfere with sugar metabolism (Table A and B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182985.s004">S4 File</xref>).</p><p>Several of the detected changes, especially those observed for AuCeO<sub>2</sub>, have also been detected in cultured cells treated with different kind of nanoparticles, including the increase in different amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamate or glutamine) and the decrease in PC, GPC, formate and ATP [<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182985.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The increase of the GSH/GSSG seems to be specific for nanoparticles with anti-oxidant properties, such as gold and silver nanoparticles, as it has not been detected for copper, cobalt or titanium nanoparticles.</p><p>Control experiments with CeO<sub>2</sub> and chitosan revealed that the observed effects were mainly due to the combination of Au with chitosan and CeO<sub>2</sub>, as very few significant metabolic changes were observed after treatment with chitosan and CeO<sub>2</sub> in the absence of Au (Tables D&#x02013;F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182985.s003">S3 File</xref>). In the case of RBCs, ATP also increased, which could mean that part of the alteration in the energetic metabolism of these cells can be already be induced by the support/coating materials. They also seem to cause a slight decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in these cells, which seems to be compensated by the antioxidant effect of Au when the materials are combined with gold. For PMNs, a tendency for glucose and GSH to increase, and lactate to decrease seem to be present when they are treated with chitosan and CeO<sub>2</sub>, but these changes are only significant when Au is introduced. Changes in PBMCs (lactate and acetoacetate) seem not to be related with the changes that take place in the presence of gold nanoparticles.</p><p>In summary, results indicate that chitosan gold nanoparticles possess a relevant oxidative capacity, especially on PMNs cells, while this effect was much less pronounced for AuCeO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, although both nanoparticles have been described as biocompatible, they have an impact on several metabolic routes (e.g., the bioenergetic metabolism of cells, amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism). Therefore, these characteristics should be taken into consideration for the clinical development of these materials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This work presents a preliminary study aiming to contribute to the design and evaluation of nanoparticles for biomedical applications. A protocol was developed for the monitoring of a large number of polar and non-polar metabolites from three different types of peripheral blood cells (RBCs, PMNs, and PBMCs). The protocol was successfully applied to the evaluation of the effect of nanomaterials on these cells, an application that could have important implications from a traslational point of view. Treatment of the three blood cell types with gold nanoparticles, which were stabilized on ceria or chitosan, revealed different systematic changes in the metabolic profile of the cells, which were related to the antioxidant effect of the materials but also reflected alterations in other metabolomics pathways. In combination with other analytical and biochemical techniques, this tool could provide relevant information about the mechanism of action and side effects of new nanomedicines, which in turn could offer a better way for the optimization and evaluation of these nanoparticles. Interesting further projects include the analysis of the effect of different types of nanoparticles, especially those that are already in clinical trials, and the comparison of the effect that they have on the blood from patients and from healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182985.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Characterization of AuChi and AuCeO2 nanoparticles.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182985.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182985.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Cellular viability study with the MTT assay.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182985.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182985.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Data tables of metabolomics changes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182985.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182985.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Pathway analysis.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182985.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec>
