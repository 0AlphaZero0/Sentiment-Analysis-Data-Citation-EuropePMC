<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first interactions between <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) and its human host occur in the lungs after inhalation of aerosolised bacteria. Approximately fifty percent of individuals exposed to Mtb remain uninfected [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and host-determinants have been associated with this resistance to or clearance of infection in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The absence of a detectable peripheral adaptive immune response in resistant individuals suggests that it is mediated by the local innate immune system and that the respiratory mucosa plays a role in determining the outcome of exposure [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is assumed that the primary target of Mtb, an intracellular pathogen, is the alveolar macrophage in the lower airways. However, the majority of cells in the airway lining are epithelial which constitute a surface of approximately 70 m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and are thus likely to be the first point of contact for Mtb in the human host.</p><p>Epithelial cells are known to significantly contribute to the immune responses in the lungs and can sense intra- and extracellular pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, via a wide range of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast to this, their responses in tuberculosis (TB) are poorly defined and little investigated, which presents a surprising knowledge gap.</p><p>Recognition by, or infection of, epithelial cells in the human airways may shape early host responses to the bacilli and act as an adjunct to the immune response against infections. Work on human airway epithelial-like cell lines and murine airway epithelial cells has identified potential mechanisms of recognition and response to Mtb-infection, including chemokine release and antimicrobial action [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the response of primary human airway epithelial cells to Mtb infection has barely been investigated and has so far mainly concentrated on isolated pathways rather than the global epithelial response to Mtb-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The need to investigate the interactions of Mtb with primary human airway epithelial cells is further underscored by detection of Mtb in these cells during infections <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous studies reported that in animal models of tuberculosis infection the bronchial and alveolar epithelium is infected after instillation with Mtb [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Mtb DNA was detected in human epithelial cells of histologically normal lung tissue in healthy latently infected individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we hypothesised that human primary airway epithelial cells contribute to the protective early host response to Mtb-infection in the human respiratory tract. To test this, we interrogated the direct response of epithelial cells to Mtb as well as indirect effects mediated via an immune-network comprising infected myeloid cells, by measuring the global epithelial transcriptome. Through <italic>in vitro</italic> infection and transwell co-culture models, we identified primary bronchial epithelial cells to be inert to direct Mtb-infection, yet to be potent responders within an Mtb-activated immune network, mediated by IL1 &#x003b2; and type I IFN, with the capacity to shape the local antimicrobial and immunological environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bronchial epithelial cells dominate the airway lining and are resistant to Mtb challenge <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>In healthy human airways, epithelial cells were the major cell type lining the respiratory tract and harboured less than 10% of leukocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006577.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), of which macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils contributed on average 86.4%, 12.5% and 1.1%, respectively. The abundance of epithelial cells increases the likelihood that Mtb interacts directly with the epithelial lining after inhalation of aerosols. To assess whether human airway epithelial cells are permissive to intracellular Mtb-infection, primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) recovered from bronchial brushes were expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> and infected with Mtb.

Microarray analysis revealed no significant differences in gene expression after statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons.

The secreted protein content (secretome) was measured through LC-MS. We detected 654 proteins at significantly different levels in co-culture compared to infected THP-1 monocultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006577.s008">S2 Table</xref>). This included increased levels of IL1&#x003b2; in THP-1 PBEC co-culture, which confirmed our previous ELISA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006577.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). To identify which of these proteins were differentially expressed at the gene level in PBECs during co-culture, the gene expression signature was converted into UniProt IDs, which mapped to 341 proteins of which 18 were detected in the transcriptomic and secretome analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006577.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Three entities, the leukocyte chemoattractants IL8, CXCL1 and CXCL10, associated with the GO term &#x02018;chemotaxis&#x02019; (GO:0006935, AmiGO 2, Gene Ontology Consortium). Myeloid-epithelial cross-talk significantly induced their expression in PBECs and the subsequent release into the culture supernatant, thus directly contributing to the chemotactic environment during Mtb-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006577.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). In fact, in a transwell chemotaxis assay, confirmed, that the epithelial-driven differences in the mediator environment contributed to cellular influx towards the site of infection. The largest population in peripheral blood are polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006577.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), of which neutrophils are rapid responders during bacterial infections [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PMN migration towards cell free cell-culture supernatants, which was generated in the same ways as the supernatants for secretome analysis, was measured. Supernatants from infected epithelial-myeloid co-cultures attracted on average approximately 9-fold more PMNs than supernatants from infected THP-1 monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006577.g009">Fig 9C&#x02013;9F</xref>), suggesting that epithelial cells contribute crucially to the leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection.</p><fig id="ppat.1006577.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006577.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>PBECs upregulate chemokines and enhance neutrophil recruitment to the site of Mtb-infection.</title><p>(A) The Venn diagramme shows the overlap between significantly induced genes in PBECs exposed to Mtb-infected THP-1 cells at 24h (Expression) and significantly increased secreted proteins during infected PBEC-THP-1 co-culture over infected THP-1 monoculture at 48h (Secretome).

While macrophages are well known to respond and interact with Mtb, airway epithelial cells are understudied. We present the first global transcriptomic profiling of primary human airway epithelial cells in response to Mtb and Mtb-driven inflammation and found that epithelial cells contribute distinctly to the host response against Mtb through antimicrobial effectors as well as by amplifying the chemotactic environment initiated by infected macrophages to shape the local immunological environment.</p><p>To interrogate the epithelium in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting which resembles early immune interactions in the human respiratory tract more physiologically, we established a co-culture model to allow contact-independent communication between PBECs and infected myeloid cells in real time. We used THP-1 cells to model myeloid responses in the co-culture system developed here and confirmed that the epithelial expression patterns are the same in response to Mtb-infected alveolar macrophages or THP-1 cells.</p><p>Through biological over-representation analysis of the epithelial transcriptome, we have uncovered the paracrine activation of epithelial cells by type I IFNs and IL1&#x003b2;. The interplay of type I IFN and IL1 has recently been elegantly delineated within infected macrophages and has been proposed as a point of therapeutic intervention during active tuberculosis [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While the cross-regulation of IL1 and type I IFN signalling in the Mtb-infected macrophage is an important well-documented rapidly-evolving area, our findings revealed for the first time that these pathways also act on the epithelial lining. In contrast to the induction patterns of IL1 and type I IFN within macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and their respective cross-regulation, the paracrine epithelial activation induced by these two mediators occurred independently of each other with abrogation of either signalling pathway leaving gene expression of the opposite mediator untouched.</p><p>The activation of epithelial cells through Mtb-driven myeloid-derived type I IFNs has not previously been reported. Despite the association of type I IFNs with neutrophil-driven disease severity of tuberculosis in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the effect of type I IFNs on the outcome of Mtb-infection early after exposure is yet to be determined. Early myeloid-driven activation of IFN-signalling may be beneficial for the host as evidenced by the finding that IFN I and IFN&#x003b3; are both required for optimal immune cell recruitment during the initial pre-adaptive phase of Mtb-infection in a mouse model [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our findings further support this concept and showed that type I IFN signalling is required to induce epithelial transcription of the chemotactic factor <italic>CXCL10</italic> during Mtb-driven inflammation in humans. This activation, together with IL1&#x003b2;-mediated chemokine expression, amplifies cellular influx initiated by infected myeloid cells.</p><p>We observed that PBECs significantly enhance the neutrophil influx induced by infected myeloid cells and suggest that they may support rapid recruitment to the initial site of infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Neutrophils are important early antimicrobial effectors with poor specificity. While they can cause substantial tissue damage and inflammation, their antimicrobial properties are crucial to control and prevent recurrent infections in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Tissue neutrophilia is associated with pathogenesis during active TB; however, influx of neutrophils early after infection has been suggested to be beneficial for host control of the pathogen. Absence of neutrophils during early mycobacterial infection results in increased bacterial burden in mice and zebrafish [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and growth control of mycobacteria by whole blood <italic>in vitro</italic> is strongly dependent on neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] which may be an important function at the site of infection.</p><p>Besides the release of chemokines, myeloid-derived IL1&#x003b2; mediated the antimicrobial responses elicited in PBECs, including induction of <italic>DEFB4</italic> expression, in accordance with previously reported findings [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We further confirmed that DEFB4 was a potent direct anti-mycobacterial effector. While &#x003b2;-defensins are known to kill mycobacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], IL1&#x003b2;-induced S100-family members have not previously been considered to be active against Mtb. Whilst both <italic>S100A7A</italic> (encoding koebnerisin) and <italic>S100A7</italic> (encoding psoriasin) are antibacterial effectors in the skin, neither were known to have antimycobacterial activity prior to our current discovery that psoriasin limited Mtb growth in liquid culture.</p><p>IL1&#x003b2; which mediated AMP-expression, is increased in the airways during active TB [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; and may already be elevated early after Mtb-infection of alveolar macrophages before the onset of detectable lung pathology. This would then result in the activation of epithelial antimicrobial responses at the earliest stages of the natural history of tuberculosis in the human airways. Interestingly, IL1&#x003b2; -dependent epithelial AMP-expression was further enhanced by TNF in PBECs during co-culture with infected myeloid cells. While augmentation of TNF signalling by IL1&#x003b2; has been described in macrophages before [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we believe that this is the first time that IL1&#x003b2; activation was shown to be enhanced by TNF in Mtb-infection. Epithelial antimicrobial peptides during infection may contribute to host defense against free extracellular mycobacteria thus preventing or diminishing cell to cell spread in early infection. They may also be a promising therapeutic target, since their activity is not affected by multidrug resistance of Mtb. Additionally, the identification of epithelial-specific AMP-expression with anti-mycobacterial activity may complement myeloid responses to Mtb in the airways, since monocytes and macrophages do not express high levels of the AMPs identified here [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Prior studies of macrophage-driven activation of epithelial cells focussed solely on specific pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], involving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or <italic>DEFB4</italic>. Our data provide the first global perspective on the epithelial response to Mtb infection, and reveal important new targets in the epithelial response to Mtb-infection while simultaneously confirming the previously published findings. In transwell co-culture, a large proportion of the expression signature (112 genes) was associated with the innate immune response, including type I IFN and cytokine-mediated signalling. <italic>IL36G</italic>, which is an emerging IL1-family member, was dependent on myeloid-derived IL1 &#x003b2;. It has recently been described to have a host-protective role during Mtb-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and its epithelial release may support macrophage function further. As part of the type I interferon-inducible mediators, the known antiviral factor <italic>ISG15</italic> was upregulated and its secretion during mycobacterial infection is involved in the appropriate induction of IFN&#x003b3; in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These are only two of several genes uncovered by the co-culture model we have established, which provide interesting targets for future investigations, but where further analysis into their function was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>In contrast to their multifaceted responses to myeloid Mtb-infection, PBECs were surprisingly inert to direct stimulation with Mtb. This was not due to a general non-responsiveness to PRR-stimulation, as PBECs mount a substantial IL8 response towards synthetic TLR-agonists and in response to <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (Reuschl et al, <italic>manuscript in preparation</italic>). The global assessment of the transcriptomic response to direct stimulation with live Mtb revealed that no genes were significantly upregulated after 24h and this was complemented by poor invasion and adherence of Mtb to epithelial cells. This finding is consistent with reports of poor invasion of Mtb into primary tracheal epithelial cells in comparison to dendritic cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, two days after <italic>intra tracheal</italic> Mtb-infection of mice, which results in locally very high density of Mtb bacilli, the majority of bacilli are found in macrophages and only approximately 10% of intracellular Mtb can be detected in epithelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Epithelial inertia to Mtb and the lack of uptake in humans may thus ensure the uptake of Mtb by local professional phagocytes, the preferred target host cell of Mtb after inhalation in the human lungs. Our co-culture model did not include endothelial cells and it remains to be seen whether interaction with an endothelial layer would augment the epithelial response to Mtb. Our findings contrast with previous studies, which described epithelial susceptibility to infection and upregulation of chemokines in A549 cells within 24h [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This most likely reflects differences between primary cells and cell lines, as A549 cells are adenocarcinoma-derived and may not truly mimic the responses of healthy human respiratory epithelium [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Through the recovery of PBECs from several donors, we have overcome the limitations of using a single cell line and reflected true biological variation in humans.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, the airway epithelium is at an air-liquid-interface, polarised and differentiated. However, in our model, the epithelial cells were undifferentiated and in submerged culture which allowed for comparison with the existing literature. Mediator release of undifferentiated epithelium to viral infection or air pollution particles surpasses the release by differentiated epithelium [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] suggesting that the inert phenotype of PBECs in response to Mtb is not an underestimate of their <italic>in vivo</italic> response and is moreover consistent with the lack of epithelial infection observed in mice <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We expanded and studied human primary cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, as opposed to using respiratory epithelial cell lines or mouse models. A limitation of our study is the focus on primary bronchial epithelial cells which, unlike alveolar epithelial cells, can be obtained by bronchoscopy. The recovery of pure alveolar epithelial cells requires samples from resections of dissected lungs or post-mortem cadaveric explants which may not reflect the responsiveness of healthy epithelium, and their phenotype is difficult to maintain <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Primary alveolar epithelial cells should be used to address whether our findings extend to human alveolar epithelial cells. This would be of interest as differences in the responsiveness to pro-inflammatory mediators between upper and lower airway epithelial cells have been previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Myeloid-epithelial cross-talk was independent of cell-cell contact, providing evidence that the bronchial epithelium is able to respond to Mtb-infection upon activation by secreted mediators which diffuse from the site of infection throughout the airspaces. In the future, it would be important to assess the mechanisms identified in our study in PBECs derived from patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, where epithelial responsiveness may be altered. Most of the epithelial cells within the human airways will not be in direct contact with the small number of infected alveolar macrophages. The majority of the initial epithelial response would therefore be expected to be driven by soluble mediators. Our experimental rationale therefore focussed on contact-independent interactions between infected myeloid and primary epithelial cells. Based on our findings, future work should also include direct interactions between the myeloid and epithelial compartment during infection to assess how cell-cell contact modulates the response to Mtb.</p><p>Our findings shed light on the contribution of the respiratory epithelial lining to the response against Mtb as well as the complexity of the immune response in the airways early after infection. It is known from challenge studies with rhinovirus in humans and <italic>ex vivo</italic> infection of bronchial tissue that only a limited number of epithelial cells are actively infected [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], yet potent immune activation occurs throughout the epithelial lining. Given that infection with Mtb requires only very few aerosolised mycobacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], amplification of the macrophage-response to infection by uninfected surrounding epithelium may very well be decisive for the outcome of infection. Appropriate animal models of Mtb-infection should be employed to assess the reported epithelial responses <italic>in vivo</italic> during early infection.</p><p>In summary, we show that PBECs are inert to direct early Mtb-infection, but potent responders to infected alveolar macrophages. PBECs contributed to host defense as part of an Mtb-activated immune network through pathways, which are likely protective early after infection, by creating an extracellular antimicrobial milieu and promoting early neutrophil influx. Through these cell-specific differential responses to myeloid-derived cytokines, airway epithelial cells likely fulfil a non-redundant role in the human pulmonary host response to Mtb as vital players with the potential to shape the human innate immune response to infection and influence the outcome of exposure to Mtb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Recruitment and ethics statement</title><p>PBECs and AM&#x003a6;s were collected through bronchial brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage from the airways of healthy volunteers during bronchoscopic procedure at St. Mary&#x02019;s Hospital, London, United Kingdom.

A volume of 80 &#x003bc;l of sample was reduced with 5 mM DTT (Sigma) for 30 min at 60&#x000b0;C and alkylated with 10 mM of iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. 1 &#x003bc;g Trypsin/Lys-C mix (Promega) was added for 18 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Samples were adjusted to 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma)and peptide digests were purified using the C18 STop And Go Extraction (STAGE) tips [PMID: 16602707] and resuspended in 2% (w/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) fomic acid for LC-MS. Samples were analysed using an EASY-nLC 1000 Liquid chromatography system coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. The separation column and emitter was an EASY-Spray column, 50 cm x 75 &#x003bc;m ID, PepMap C18, 2 &#x003bc;m particles, 100 &#x000c5; pore size. Buffer A was 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and buffer B 100% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. A gradient from 5% to 40% acetonitrile over 120 min was used to elute peptides for ionization by electrospray ionisation (ESI) and data dependent MS/MS acquisition consisting of 1 full MS1 (R = 70K) scan acquisition from 350-1500m/z, and 10 HCD type MS2 scans (R = 15K). MS/MS charge targets were limited to 1E6 and iosolation window set to 2.0 m/z, monoisotopic precursor selection, charge state screening and dynamic exclusion were enabled, charge states of +1, &#x0003e;4 and unassigned charge states were not subjected to MS2 fragmentation. Raw mass spectra were identified and quantified using Maxquant 1.5.15 using a 1% peptide and protein FDR. Searches were conducted against the Uniprot SwissProt database downloaded on 06/06/2014. The database was supplemented with common contaminant proteins introduced during proteomic experiments. Searches were specified as tryptic with 1 missed cleavage, 7 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance, 0.05 Da fragment ion mass tolerance, fixed modifications of carbamidomethylation (C), and variable modification of oxidation (M), acetylation (N-term, Protein). Protein Label free quantitation (LFQ) intensity measured in medium alone was subtracted from all paired samples, and LFQ values were log2 transformed. To identify both qualitative and quantitative effects of stimulation on extracellular all missing values were replaced assuming a normal distribution (width 0.3, and a down shift of 1.8) for only control/unstimulated samples as described in [<xref rid="ppat.1006577.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Western blot</title><p>For protein lysates PBECs were treated with RIPA buffer (Pierce) supplemented with 2x Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Pierce) and 250 U Benzonase (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Total protein concentration was measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 12 &#x003bc;g of protein lysates lysates were mixed with Laemmli buffer (BioRad, Hertfordshire, UK) and 25 mM DTT and boiled for 7 min. Proteins separated on 4%-20% Mini PROTEAN gels (BioRad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by iBlot (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/TBST for 1h and probed with primary antibodies (&#x003b1;beta-Actin (D6A8, New England Biolabs), &#x003b1;Phospho-Stat1 (Tyr701) (D4A7, New England Biolabs), &#x003b1;Stat1 (#9172, New England Biolabs)) at 1:1000 in 5% BSA/TBST over night at 4&#x000b0;C. HRP-linked IgG (New England Biolabs) (1:2000) in 5% BSA/TBST was added the next day for 1h.

Before staining, 10% human serum in FACS buffer was added to cells for 20 min to block Fc receptors. For surface staining, PBLs were incubated with &#x003b1; CD14-Brillian Violet 421 (M5E2, Biolegend), &#x003b1; CD15-Brillian Violet 605 (SSEA-1, Biolegend), &#x003b1; CD3-PE-CF594 (UCHT1, BD) and &#x003b1; CD66b-PerCP/Cy5.5 (G10F5, Biolegend). Cells were treated with Cytofix Fixation buffer, resuspendend in FACS buffer and left overnight before flow cytometric acquisition using either a BD LSR II or BD Fortessa. Anti-Mouse Ig compensation beads (BD) were used to determine compensation parameters.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>PBL transwell migration assay</title><p>Cell free culture supernatants were generated through direct co-culture of Mtb-infected THP-1 cells in the presence of absence of PBECs for 48h. BEBM was used as a background control for unspecific migration. Conditioned or control medium was added to the bottom well of a tissue culture plate and 0.5 &#x003bc;m transwell inserts (Corning) placed on top. The plates were placed in a humified 37&#x000b0;C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 30 min to equilibrate. 2.5x10<sup>5</sup> PBLs were added to the transwell insert and the plate was placed back into the incubator for cell migration. After 3h, 2mM EDTA was added to the bottom compartment to dislodge cells from the transwell membrane. Cells were collected from the insert and bottom compartment, fixed and resuspended in equal volumes of FACS buffer. Cells in each sample were enumerated through acquisition for 120 s using a BD LSR II flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Microarray data was normalised by Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) using Partek Genomic Suite 6.
