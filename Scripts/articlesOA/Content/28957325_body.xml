<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer (BC) research has largely focused on understanding the intrinsic properties of the primary tumor in order to therapeutically target key molecular components that drive progression within the tumor epithelial cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For example, tamoxifen and trastuzumab target the estrogen and human epidermal growth factor receptors (ER, HER2) whose expression levels in tumors define the traditional clinical subtypes of BC. The vast majority of BC-related genomic studies have focused on bulk tumor samples that are expected to be enriched for neoplastic epithelial cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These efforts have produced subtyping schemes that classify patients into groups based on the similarity of expression of diverse molecular markers and processes [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and generated gene signatures that can predict patient prognosis and benefit from therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Cancers however are much more than an autonomous mass of epithelial cells. They constitute multicellular systems capable of bidirectional interactions with neighboring non-malignant cells and extracellular components i.e. the tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Tumor-microenvironmental interactions are necessary for tumor progression and drug sensitivity [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and are becoming better understood [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In fact, several genomics studies of the BC microenvironment, including our efforts, show that the microenvironment reflects its tumor and harbors prognostic information [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, we also recently established that the primary tumor and its microenvironment does not harbor accurate prognostic signals in approximately 20% of BC patients [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Specifically, these patients are consistently misclassified by all hallmarks of breast tumors defining tumor epithelial cells (such as proliferation and ER status) and their microenvironment (such as the infiltration of immune cells, angiogenesis and fibroblast activation).</p><p>The systemic response (SR) in cancer patients refers here to the perturbations that occur in peripheral blood cells, which include immune effector cells and circulate throughout the body. The fact that a tumor exerts systemic effects (via eg soluble or exosomal factors) may provide an explanation for the clinical observation that patients with one tumor have an increased risk of developing several independent tumors, and that removal of primary cancer improves the survival of patients with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, since ER positive (ER+) BC tends to recur as long as 10&#x02013;15 years after surgical removal of the tumor, it is important to understand systemic factors governing late recurrence and therapeutic approaches that target beyond the tumor site. In fact, there is a rapidly increasing understanding of the various means a tumor employs to favor metastasis in distant organs [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, an &#x0201c;instigating&#x0201d; BC can exploit the patient SR so that otherwise-indolent disseminated tumor cells become activated [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The SR has also been investigated in BC at time of diagnosis. Specifically, our recent comparison of blood profiles of BC patients and matched controls yielded a gene signature that reports the presence of BC [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This diagnostic signature is specific to BC (i.e. the test classifies women with carcinoma other than breast as negative), and the composition of genes and enriched pathways in the signature suggest that a cytostatic immune-related signal in the SR of patients is associated with the presence of a tumor. Finally, recent evidence demonstrates that engagement of systemic immunity is critical to the process of tumor rejection in genetically engineered mouse models [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>This study is the first large-scale genomics effort to study the molecular relationships between patient SR and primary tumor. We generated and analyzed expression profiles from peripheral blood and matched tumor cells in 173 BC patients. First, our results highlight how the patient SR is especially relevant to BC immunogenicity. Second, we present a novel tool entitled Matched Interactions across Tissues (MIxT) that starts by identifying sets of genes tightly co-expressed across all patients in each tissue. Then, MIxT identifies which of these gene sets and pathways expressed in one tissue are associated with gene sets and pathways in the second tissue by determining if their expression patterns in tumor and in the patient SR are tightly correlated. We find that there are very few such associations when all BC are considered. However, we do identify biological processes with significant associations between tumor and patient SR when we stratify our analysis by BC subtype. That is, we identify molecular processes in the tumor that are tightly co-expressed with (different) molecular processes in the SR across patients of a specific subtype. In particular, we detail how several tumor-permissive signals are associated between the tumor and SR of basal BC patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>A population genomic resource of blood and matched tumor cells from BC patients</title><p>The Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) is a prospective population-based cohort that tracks 34% of all Norwegian women born between 1943&#x02013;57.

When selecting only strong gene-gene correlations (topological overlap &#x0003e; 0.1) and removing isolated nodes, the SR network has ~20% more genes than the tumor network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005680.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Moreover, the SR network has approximately twice as many edges (89,465 connections between genes) than the tumor network (50,617 connections between genes). Thus, the underlying patterns of expression of the tumor genes (and modules) are more dissimilar from each other than the patterns of expression of the SR genes (and modules). In both tissues, the edges that span between modules reflect natural overlaps between cellular process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005680.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).

These results also highlight the importance of distinct immune components for each of these disease groups. In particular, patients with HER2+ tumors exhibit low expression of genes specifically expressed in B-cell compared to patients with other BC subtypes. Patients with lumC tumors exhibit low expression of genes involved in T-cell homing and function compared to patients with other BC subtypes.

Moreover, the SR does not inform on the intrinsic BC subtype of the tumor such as lumA, lumB or basalL subtype or on IntClust subtypes. Interestingly, univariate markers in the patient SR were only identified for the CIT lumC subtype defined as particularly immunogenic ER+ tumors [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggesting that the SR is informative in cases where the primary tumor exhibits strong immune properties. This is consistent with previous reports that uses blood transcriptomics as a gateway into the patient immune system [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and which is extensively used in the context of autoimmune and infectious diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This result suggests that it is also applicable in cancer such as BC.</p><p>To further investigate the molecular changes in the patient SR, we extended our analyses to multivariate approaches where genes are combined into sets or &#x0201c;modules&#x0201d;. In particular, we performed cluster analysis to partition the genes of both tumor and SR profiles into modules with each module representing a distinct pattern of expression across patients. Our user-friendly website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mixt-blood-tumor.bci.mcgill.ca/">www.mixt-blood-tumor.bci.mcgill.ca</ext-link>) provides access to these modules built in each tissue, enables investigation of their expression profiles in each tissue and allow user-defined queries of gene, gene sets, and pathway of interest. Further, our MIxT approach estimates gene module expression in both tissues and find significant associations between modules across tissues in a representative cohort of BC patients.</p><p>In our dataset, the primary tumor and SR have approximately the same number of modules (19 and 23, respectively) but their gene composition is qualitatively different. Not surprisingly, many modules in tumors were enriched for genes involved in hallmarks of cancer, while SR modules were enriched for either general cellular processes or specific immune responses. Only one module involved in the IFN-I pathway is highly conserved in both tumor and SR, although the common genes had markedly different expression patterns between the two tissues. This is important as it establishes that genes, whose expression patterns may act as good markers in the primary tumor, are not necessarily expressed in the same manner within blood cells.</p><p>Our multivariate approach was able to identify modules from the patient SR that could reliably identify not only lumC but also HER2+ and large (&#x0003e; 2cm) tumors. These three cases are among the most immunogenic subtypes of BC and are of relatively poor prognosis. For these patients, gene expression in blood cells is mostly decreased compared to other BC and controls. This result also highlights the importance of distinct immune components of the SR for each of these disease groups: B-cells for HER2+ tumors, T-cells for lumC, and aspects of the cellular immune response for large tumors. Interestingly, a previous study showed that her2E tumors have the highest B-cell infiltration and expression of B-cell receptor gene segments, although this was not predictive of improved patient survival [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Our study finds an impaired systemic B-cell response specifically in HER2+ patients, consistent with an inefficient anti-tumoral response in these patients, potentially due to a dysfunctional antigen receptor response and cell development. We could also speculate that the dysfunctional thymic T-cell homing signature in lumC patients reflects the well-documented effect of estrogen on thymic T lymphopoiesis [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] in patients diagnosed with a highly immunogenic ER+ tumor. These associations would certainly require validation in follow-up studies.</p><p>Finally, MIxT focuses on molecular associations between tissues and provides a holistic view of molecular changes in BC patients. Although the focus here is towards gene expression of blood and matched tumor, our approach could be extended to multiple tissues (eg. blood-microenvironment-tumor) or other levels of molecular data (eg. DNA level somatic aberrations, gene and miRNA expression, epigenetic profiles).</p><p>Interestingly, associations between BC tumor and patient SR are heavily dependent on subtype. Only one interaction between tumor and patient SR is identified when all BC patients are considered in the analysis but many are identified when we first stratify patients by BC subtype. This is perhaps not surprising given that there is a great deal of molecular heterogeneity between BC subtypes making &#x0201c;one SR fitting all&#x0201d; highly unlikely. We identified molecular stimuli in tumors that change patient SR in multiple ways only for patients within a particular subtype. For example, expression of genes involved in alternative splicing in ER+/HER2- tumors is associated with changes in expression of multiple processes in SR of patients and those associations are observed only within this specific subtype.</p><p>Of note, immune signals measured at the tumor site are associated with distinct SR across a broad range of subtypes. Immune-related processes are known to be more or less expressed within every subtypes and have prognostic capacity in almost all subtypes [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Here we show that a change in immune activity at the tumor site is not associated with equal SR across subtypes. Furthermore, high immune signals in tumor is associated with the patient inflammatory SR in opposite ways depending if the patient is ER-/HER2- or lumB. The high inflammatory SR in ER-/HER2- patients (with low immune activity at the tumor site) and in lumB patients (with high immune activity at the tumor site) were both significantly different from how systemic inflammation is &#x0201c;normally&#x0201d; expressed in controls.</p><p>Finally, we identify other examples of interactions between tumor and patient SR that occur in subtype-specific fashions. In particular, three tumor modules were enriched for genes in known large-scale BC amplicons (16p11-13, 8q23-24). The expression of these genes changes in a coordinated manner from high to low, suggesting that these genes measure amplification of the corresponding region in BC tumors. In turn, these patterns of expression were associated with distinct SR depending on subtypes highlighting the significance of each amplicon in defining patient SR for particular BC subtypes (eg 16p13 in lumA and ER+/HER2+, and 8q23-24 in basalL and her2E). Of note, these patterns of expression also define patients with particular clinico-pathological characteristics. For example, ER+/HER2+ tumors that do not highly express the genes on 16p have a lower luminal score than ER+/HER2+ tumors that highly express the genes on 16p.</p><p>When we restrict our attention to basalL patients, we observe that both the immune-related module and the presence of a 8q23-24 amplification is associated with the patient SR. In fact, the subset of basal patients with 8q23-24 amplification exhibit high inflammatory SR and underexpress genes involved in general cellular proliferation of blood cells, in immune cytolysis, and in MYC and CD5 targets. Together, our matched profiles offer a detailed map of tumor-permissive SR particularly relevant for basalL tumors amplified on 8q and highlight a signature in the SR of basalL patients with low immune activity at their tumor site. This is especially interesting in the context of BC-immunotherapy combination or for monitoring response to these therapies. Overall, our study set the groundwork for further investigation of promising new ways to tackle and monitor the disease by looking outside the tumor and exploiting the patient SR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Gene expression data</title><p>Tumor and blood samples were obtained as part of the NOWAC study [<xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1005680.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] with approval from Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway.
