<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Globally, 10.4 million incident cases of active tuberculosis (TB) disease (ATBD) and 1.4 million TB-related deaths were reported in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over the past century, anti-TB drugs, bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccination, and public health strategies such as directly observed treatment, have contributed to a reduction in TB-related mortality [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, latent TB infection (LTBI) and recurrent ATBD remain critical issues for global control [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], particularly given that previous anti-TB treatment is an established risk factor for drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Determining the contribution of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> re-infection, as opposed to reactivation, is a challenge for numerous TB control programs, especially in endemic areas [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> re-infection can occur at any time during ATBD and LTBI, and is independent of relapse [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Furthermore, prior studies contend that differential gene expression was associated with increased risk of TB disease progression and relapse [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One study with whole-blood microarray analysis reported differential gene expression between patients with ATBD and LTBI, and identified gene expression profiles associated with host control of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> (specifically apoptosis and natural killer cell activity) [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two studies indicated that differential gene expression profiles could associate with TB relapse [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185640.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These studies show that biomarker profiles have potential to be more robust than single biomarkers of TB immunity. Interferon (IFN)-gamma, for example, is perhaps the most utilized candidate TB biomarker for a protective immune response against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; however IFN-gamma has low accuracy and predictive power, especially as a biomarker of protection or disease outcome [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, PBMCs were cryopreserved prior to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> stimulation and RNA extraction, which could affect transcriptional processes. Secondly, the interpretation of gene expression in biological function remains preliminary [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, given the use of 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup> as a relative gene expression quantitation method [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the findings need to be confirmed and extended with additional housekeeping controls [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Due to the pooling of samples in each group, there was no variance data, which restricted statistical analyses and corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. Further confirmatory studies could alternatively utilize groupwise comparisons.</p><p>Future studies are needed to elucidate the role of transcriptional signatures as immune correlates (including via single cell analysis [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185640.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], prior to any claims that such profiles are predictive of clinical morbidities (ATBD, LTBI) and treatment outcomes. Studies to date have assessed cross-sectional data and therefore have not allowed for causal inference, which we could potentially address in a human cohort. Furthermore, studies need to account for other potential confounding factors, including the heterogeneity of patient immune response [<xref rid="pone.0185640.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185640.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Nonetheless, these data provide a useful platform in defining initial immunological themes that allow us to differentiate between human patients that fall into the active (ATBD), latent (LTBI), and active-treated (PTBD) disease classes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185640.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primers in real-time PCR of differentially expressed genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185640.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185640.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Relative gene expression among patients with ATBD, LTBI, PTBD, compared to controls.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185640.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185640.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Relative gene expression among patients with ATBD, compared to LTBI.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185640.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec>
