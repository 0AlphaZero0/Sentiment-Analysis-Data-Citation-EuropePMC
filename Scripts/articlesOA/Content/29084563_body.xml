<sec id="Sec1"><title>To the editor,</title><p id="Par2">The global burden of tuberculosis is high, with 10.4 million cases and 1.4 million deaths in 2015. Especially in Bangladesh the disease is highly prevalent, with 225 new cases per 100,000 citizens in 2015 (Global Tuberculosis Report World Health Organization 2016). While CD4+ T cells and type 1 cytokines are well-studied components of protective immunity after infection with the causative agent <italic>Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis</italic>, recent investigations also point to a role for neutrophils in the host response during tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Neutrophils are the cell types predominantly infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the blood transcriptional signature associated with human tuberculosis is driven by neutrophil-specific gene expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While neutrophils are not able to kill <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], they may assist in host defense and containment of the infection by interacting with other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Neutrophils can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of nucleosomes, histones and granular proteases such as elastase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. NETs can exert antimicrobial effects, in part mediated through their ability to trap pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent investigations have implicated NETs in the host response to tuberculosis. Neutrophils release NETs upon incubation with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and sputum of patients with tuberculosis contains NETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to obtain evidence for NETs release in the circulation during human tuberculosis. For this we measured the plasma concentrations of nucleosomes, a suitable marker for NETs formation in plasma in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], in conjunction with neutrophil elastase, in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis.</p><p id="Par3">Sixty one patients (age 28 [22&#x02013;44] years) and 32 healthy blood donors (30 [24&#x02013;35] years) were recruited in the Tuberculosis Clinic of Chittagong General Hospital and the Chittagong Medical College &#x00026; Hospital, Chittagong, Bangladesh (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee, Bangladesh Medical Research Council, Bangladesh and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK (OXTREC 35&#x02013;09). Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects or next-of-kin by a native Bengali speaker. These subjects were part of a larger population in which the expression of Toll-like receptor regulators was studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The study subjects were all newly registered patients who had not (yet) received therapy at the time of enrolment. On-site tuberculosis confirmation was defined by a minimum of two out of three positive Ziehl-Neelsen stained sputum samples collected on two consecutive days. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (GeneXpert, Cepheid, Solna, Sweden). White blood cells were manually counted by blood smear. All patients and controls were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (Determine&#x000ae; HIV 1/2 test; Almere, Tilburg, The Netherlands). Nucleosomes, elastase-&#x003b1;1-antitrypsin and factor VII&#x02013;activating protease (FSAP)-&#x003b1;2-antiplasmin complexes were measured in citrate-anticoagulated plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The nucleosome ELISA uses a catching antibody that recognizes histone 3 and a detection antibody that recognizes an epitope exposed on complexes of histone 2A, histone 2B and double stranded DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Comparisons between groups were performed by Mann-Whitney U tests and correlations were calculated by Spearman&#x02019;s rho test using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

</p><p id="Par4">Demographic data, together with clinical signs and symptoms, are shown in the Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Patients did not have significant comorbidities. Relative to healthy controls, tuberculosis patients had leucocytosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, panel A) caused by a rise in neutrophil counts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, panel B). Patients with active tuberculosis showed elevated plasma levels of nucleosomes when compared with local healthy blood donors (111.7&#x000a0;U/ml versus 5.4&#x000a0;U/ml, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, panel C).

Tuberculosis patients more often smoked than healthy controls (49% versus 25% respectively, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and a recent study showed nicotine has NETs inducing properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, comparing nucleosomes and elastase levels between smokers and non-smokers within the tuberculosis patient group showed no significant differences (data not shown).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Leukocyte counts, neutrophil counts, plasma levels of nucleosomes, elastase and factor VII&#x02013;activating protease in patients with pulmonary.

</p><p id="Par5">Elastase is an important component of NETs that can assist in the degradation of bacterial virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Upon activation of neutrophils elastase translocates to the nucleus, where it aids in chromatin decondensation leading to NETosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, elastase can activate macrophages and increase their capacity to kill intracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, macrophages can bind <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> induced NETs and ingest elastase from neutrophils, leading to the release of increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] like we found in the tuberculosis patients included in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Together these data suggest that during tuberculosis elastase could be involved in an interaction between NETotic cells and macrophages resulting in a proinflammatory and protective immune response. Notably, this interaction between NETs, elastase and other host cells may also be associated with collateral damage, as has been described in a variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Two patients (3%) and none of the blood donors tested positive for HIV (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The low prevalence of HIV positive tuberculosis in our cohort is in accordance with data from the World Health Organization derived from Bangladesh (Global Tuberculosis Report World Health Organization 2016 and allowed us to study the association between tuberculosis and NETs formation without the potential bias introduced by concurrent HIV infection. Indeed, HIV, like <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (6&#x02013;8), triggers NETs release from neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">FSAP circulates as a single-chain molecule and is activated upon contact with apoptotic and necrotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Activated FSAP mediates the release of nucleosomes from apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Acute infections, particularly sepsis, are associated with an increased activity of FSAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In our cohort plasma FSAP activation as measured by FSAP-&#x003b1;2-antiplasmin complexes did not differ between tuberculosis patients and controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, panel F), suggesting that FSAP may not contribute to nucleosome release in this population. The absence of increased FSAP activity further suggests that nucleosome release during tuberculosis is caused by NETosis rather than by apoptosis or necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this context it is interesting to note that neutrophil apoptosis is not required for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> induced NETosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Our study has limitations. Duration of symptoms was not documented. Our data do not prove that plasma nucleosomes are solely or predominantly derived from neutrophils. The poor resource setting and the relatively small sample size precluded careful evaluation between disease severity and nucleosome levels. In addition, the lack of follow up samples excluded analyses of sequential nucleosome levels and disease course. None of the patients died from tuberculosis.</p><p id="Par9">In conclusion, we here provide evidence for the release of NETs in the circulation of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, corroborating previous studies showing the capacity of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to induce NETs release from neutrophils in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our study does not reveal whether plasma nucleosomes originate from infected lesions or from systemic release, although the concurrently elevated plasma elastase levels and the fact that tuberculosis is associated with altered gene expression in blood neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] suggest that the latter option is more likely. The exact role of NETs in the host response during tuberculosis, whether contributing to protective immunity or causing collateral damage, requires further investigation.</p></sec>
