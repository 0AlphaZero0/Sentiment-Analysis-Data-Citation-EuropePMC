<sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Th1 type cellular activity plays a key role for the control of<italic> M. tuberculosis (MTb)</italic> as well as the induction of long-term memory conferring protective immunity [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To this end heterologous prime boost strategies have been shown as a potent and effective alternative to promote not only immunological memory but they also can trigger innate immune responses independent of T cell immunity [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, in order to better understand<italic> MTb</italic>-specific immune mechanisms, both cellular and innate immune responses should be taken into account and the role of pivotal cytokines orchestrating their complex interactions should be elucidated [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One important family of infection-induced cytokines is type I interferons (IFN-I) (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>). IFN-I promote differentiation/activation of DCs in both human and mice and play an important role in long-term survival of CD8+T cells in response to specific antigens (Ag) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and importantly in the regulation of the Th1 responses [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The role and influence of the type I IFNs as mucosal adjuvants against influenza virus and in cancer immunotherapy is well documented, on innate [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and adaptive cell populations [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, contrasting and controversial results have been provided against microbial infections in vivo as well as in vitro [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, mice infected with<italic> MTb</italic> hypervirulent clinical isolate HN878, and treated intranasally with IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, were unable to restrain bacterial growth, presumably due to a failure to develop Th1 type immunity [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A similar negative effect has been observed in patients infected with hepatitis C virus and<italic> M. tuberculosis</italic>; IFN-alpha monotherapy exacerbated the disease [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Two recent studies pinpoint the potential role of type I IFNs in antimycobacterial infections. First, an inducible type I IFNs transcriptional signature in white blood leucocytes (neutrophils) correlated with active tuberculosis determined by microarrays and flow cytometry [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Second, targeting host innate inflammatory response can mediate IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> eicosanoid production that limits excessive production type I IFNs, leading to a host resistance to<italic> M. tuberculosis</italic> infections. Therefore, this crosstalk represents a potential target against multidrug resistant<italic> MTb </italic>strains and/or chemotherapy in human tuberculosis [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At this point, our group have reported that IFN-alpha associated with BCG protects against<italic> M. lepraemurium</italic>; a mice pathogen elicited a similar skin lesion to<italic> M. leprae</italic> in adults persons with a concomitant increase in NO synthase [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been reported that IFN-beta can augment BCG immunogenicity and IL-12 production [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. BCG vaccine still showed a high variability and loss of prolonged cellular and immunological memory during adulthood [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>In the present work, we are reporting that under specific settings IFN-alpha boosting of BCG vaccine can drive the development of specific antimycobacterial cellular immune responses and restrict<italic> M. tuberculosis</italic> growth either in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Several studies have established the role of IFN-I as natural immune adjuvants for commercial vaccines [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The role of type I IFNs against mycobacterial infections is controversial and depending of the experimental settings. Thus, it has been reported that type I IFNs (beta) can exacerbate the infection; presumably by hampering the development of the Th1 cellular immune responses [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Giacomini et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have shown that IFN-beta endowed BCG-infected DC with the capacity to polarize Th1 cellular immune response, through IL-12 production, suggesting that IFN-beta could be a possible candidate vaccine [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To note is the fact that therapy of tuberculosis could be based on innate response, since it has been found that in tuberculosis patients there is an imbalance of the eicosanoid synthesis [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, promotion of this synthesis with some drugs can limit IFNs type I and restrict<italic> MTb</italic> growth [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a different experimental settings, we have reported that successive IFN-alpha administration on BCG-vaccinated mice protected it against<italic> M. lepraemurium</italic> [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], accompanied by a difference in nitric oxide synthase induction [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while no effects in the Th1/Th2 cytokine pattern were found [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thereafter, and upon this result, we hypothesized that type I IFNs should be administered in association with BCG vaccine, in order to exert an adjuvant effect [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The data obtained in this work support this, since interferon alpha boosting of BCG vaccine drives also the development of a specific antimycobacterial Th1-type inducing immunity either in the mouse model of tuberculosis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) or in human celll lines (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(c)</xref>), leading to a restriction of the<italic> MTb</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The data are not contradictory to those reported elsewhere [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], since the group of mice treated only with IFN-alpha showed a higher bacterial load while the group of mice vaccinated with BCG and IFN-alpha did not. We reason that the combined action of IFN-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and BCG vaccine could be playing an important role in maintaining a more activated state to maintain killing macrophages properties and T cell alive [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, recent data from the literature show that the use of BCG and IFN-alpha increases the proinflammatory cytokine production like TNF-alpha [35, 36In contrast, IFN-alpha induction has been related to an increase in IL-10 production, which interferes with IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> induction, essential for macrophage activation. Therefore, the use of IFN-alpha alone hampers the control of bacterial growth. Current efforts are being made in order to dissect gene expression profiles of IFN-alpha associated with BCG vaccine in vitro to identify those genes that can serve as biomarker of either host innate or adaptive immune response (iNOS, eicosanoid production, or antimicrobial peptides), or other components of the IFNs signalization that might be involved in the resistance to<italic> MTb</italic>. The understanding and integration of the different actors of both types of immune responses and for some others are still unidentified; we think that they are key for the development of candidate vaccine adjuvants against tuberculosis.</p><p>In summary, we are reporting a novel protocol that is based on IFN-alpha alpha boosting of BCG-inducing immunity that might be explored as a potential alternative immunotherapy against pathogenic mycobacteria infections.</p></sec>
