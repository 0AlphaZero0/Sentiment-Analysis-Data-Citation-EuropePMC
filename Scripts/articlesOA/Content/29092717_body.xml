Mycobacteria, including non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), are an important group of pathogens that infect HIV/AIDS patients more often than immunocompetent individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The regimens and course of TB/NTM infection treatment are different. Anti-TB drug regimens include isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, etc. Drug regimens for NTM infections include kanamycin and rifabutin, or azithromycin and rifabutin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although rifabutin has anti-TB action, the treatment of patients infected with TB or NTM is not directly analogous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both HIV/TB and HIV/NTM-infected patients may die if they are not treated promptly and accurately.</p><p id="Par7">However, the clinical manifestations of NTM/HIV and TB/HIV are similar, including fever, cough, and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the type of mycobacterial infection by the patient&#x02019;s clinical status. The golden evidence is mycobacterial culture and microscopic identification of the bacterial strains. However, it takes 3 to 4&#x000a0;weeks to obtain the results of a liquid culture medium for mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the positivity rate of mycobacterial culture is low (less than 50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The MPB64 antigen has been shown to be specific for the TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and used clinically for identification of TB after mycobacterium culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, this period is too long for patients who need anti-NTM or anti-TB therapies.</p><p id="Par8">Other immunological indicators such as interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) can rapidly diagnose TB infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity of IGRAs are compromised in HIV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and these methods cannot distinguish latent from active TB infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Second, several NTM (e.g. in <italic>Mycobacterium kansasii</italic>, <italic>M. szulgai</italic>, and <italic>M. marinum</italic>) also express the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 protein, which is detected by IGRAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, these immunological methods are expensive and difficult to implement in low-income countries with a high burden of infectious diseases, including HIV, TB, and NTM.</p><p id="Par9">Therefore, it is necessary to implement a simple and effective strategy to distinguish NTM from TB infection in HIV infected patients in low-income area who need empirical therapy or diagnostic therapy immediately. The purpose of this study was to help chronic HIV-infected patients suspected with TB/NTM infection distinguish TB from NTM by comparing the levels of routinely detected indicators in blood.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">Mycobacterial culture specimens were collected from May 2010 to March 2016 in the Department of Mycobacterial Culture in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, the largest referral center for patients with HIV infection or AIDS in East China.

However, NTM infections of soft tissue, lymph node or bone are less prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In contrast, tuberculosis easily disseminate to other organizations. One of the reasons is that tuberculosis granuloma play an important role in expansion and dissemination of tuberculosis infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">There was no significant difference in the CD4 T cell count between the two study groups, and this result might suggest that the immunity of HIV/NTM or HIV/TB infection was similar. Although the guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize that HIV-infected patients with a CD4 T-cell count lower than 50 cells/&#x003bc;l are more susceptible to infection with NTM but not with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We found that even in cases of which the CD4 cell count was higher than 100 cells/&#x003bc;l, the patients could still be infected with NTM.

The ESR and CRP had a moderate effect on the identification of co-infection with HIV and either TB or NTM. The probable cause of this difference was that TB infection might induce a stronger inflammatory response than NTM infection. The CRP concentration in HIV(&#x02212;) patients infected with TB was also reported to be higher than in non-HIV patients infected with NTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">These results, combined with data on leukocyte count and neutrophils, allow us to speculate that HIV patients infected with TB might present a stronger inflammatory response than HIV patients infected with NTM. This result may be because of the characteristics of the two types of microorganisms. TB is not an opportunistic pathogen. The patients have to undergo anti-TB chemotherapy after the diagnosis of active TB infection. However, NTM are common opportunistic pathogens and their natural environment is larger than that of TB. Furthermore, NTM can survive in the soil, water, milk, food products, aerosols, and wild and domestic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Therefore, the infectivity and pathogenicity of NTM are lower than those of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, NTM is the name of a variety of non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and some of which may be higher pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Our results indicated that the concentration of albumin in HIV/TB patients was lower than that in the HIV/NTM group.
