Around 20% of TB patients develop tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE), an accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural cavity, due to tuberculous pleuritis, i.e., inflammation of the pleura<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Tuberculous pleuritis usually presents as an acute illness with fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain, and is diagnosed by elevated levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and interferon-gamma (IFN&#x003b3;) in the pleural fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Tuberculous pleuritis is caused by delayed type hypersensitivity responses to mycobacterial antigens in the pleural space with low bacterial burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although ~70% pleural fluid cells are T cells, pleural macrophages are also known to contribute to the pathogenesis of tuberculous pleuritis and the outcome of different clinic forms of TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Macrophages are the first line of defense against invading microbes and mediate innate immune responses through pathogen recognition and activation of inflammatory reactions. Depending on the stimulations and microenvironment, macrophages polarize to different functional states, including the classically activated M1 and the alternatively activated M2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The M1 phenotype is associated with secretion of large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines and killing of microbes. The M2 type of macrophages exhibits immunoregulatory, phagocytosis, and tissue remodeling and repair functions. In TB patients, alveolar macrophages in the lungs are directly infected by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. Depending on the stage of infection and disease development, macrophages can produce either pro-inflammatory and microbicidal responses or immunosuppressive and tissue repairing responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For example, in newly onset TB patients and during the early phase of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, macrophages exhibit an M1-like phenotype producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to the development of TPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The frontline treatment of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection is a combination of four antibiotics: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol (HRZE). Antibiotics treatment significantly eliminates the bacterial load and inhibits the formation of TPE. Although antibiotics are most widely known for their direct microbicidal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, increasing evidence suggests that many antibiotics also modulate activities of immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For example, rifampicin is known to induce the expression of CD1 in human T cells and monocytes and therefore immune responses to various infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Isoniazid eliminates antigen-specific T cells by inducing apoptosis in TB animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and also regulates both adaptive and innate immune responses during its induction of liver injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Pyrazinamide modulates the host immune response to infection by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF&#x003b1; production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and activates the mouse macrophage by inducing expression of CD80, CD86 and MHCII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide together robustly activate autophagy through reactive oxygen species in mycobacterial-infected murine macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. A pertinent question is whether and how antibiotics treatment in TB patients modulates macrophage polarization and function.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, O&#x02019;Garra and colleagues have started to address this question by transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TB patients before and after antibiotics treatment. They report the identification of a whole-blood host-response-specific 393-transcript signature, which reflects mycobacterial infection, and a whole-blood treatment-specific 320-transcript signature for monitoring the efficiency of antibiotics treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Because total PBMCs were used, their studies did not define the contribution of specific immune cell types. Furthermore, compared to TPE, although peripheral blood is more accessible but it is farther removed from the primary site of mycobacterial infection. Whether and how antibiotics treatment in TB patients affects specific immune cell types, such as macrophages, in the proximal site of infection has not been investigated.</p><p id="Par6">In this study we have examined changes in phenotype and function of pleural macrophages in TB patients before and after antibiotics treatment by assaying their expression of surface markers, transcription profiles and phagocytosis activities. Our results show that pleural macrophages are polarized from M1-like to M2-like phenotype as early as 2 days post antibiotics treatment. A signature of 230 genes was identified to reflect the treatment-specific response in pleural macrophages. Among these genes, some were modulated by direct antibiotics treatment of purified pleural macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our study defines responses of pleural macrophages to antibiotics treatment in TB patients and raises the possibility of therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics in treating tuberculous pleuritis by modulating activities of pleural macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pleural macrophages are polarized in response to antibiotics treatment</title><p id="Par7">We enrolled 171 patients with tuberculous pleuritis for studying the effect of antibiotics on macrophage polarization.

Interestingly, comparing to expression profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) to various stimuli, the most positively correlated stimulus is the TLR2 ligand P3C (Pam3Cys) and combination of LPS and Immune Complex (LPS_IC). Anti-TB antibiotics treatment induced the <italic>TLR2</italic> and <italic>TLR4</italic> expression in lymphocytes and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes in pulmonary tuberculous patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These results suggest that anti-TB antibiotics might directly modulate the TLR signaling to regulate the gene expression in pleural macrophages. The master regulation analysis also identified several non-interferon or TNF responsive TFs that regulate the differentially expressed genes, such as <italic>MAFA</italic>, <italic>MTF1</italic> and <italic>MEF2D</italic>. These non-interferon or TNF responsive TFs could play a key role in modulating pleural macrophages response to anti-TB antibiotics. Thus, the efficacy of antibiotics in treating tuberculous pleuritis may depend not only on direct killing of mycobacteria but also on modulating the function of pleural macrophages. Consistent with this notion, differentiation of pleural macrophages to M2-like phenotype may promote tissue repair.</p><p id="Par16">Current management of TB treatment lacks robust tools to monitor the treatment efficiency in the early stage during the long-term antibiotics treatment, especially for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We show that the pro-inflammatory mediators IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; and IL6 in TPE were decreased significantly post antibiotics treatment as short as 2~3 days. The reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines was also observed in the serum, but not until 2~4 months post treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Because TPE is more proximal to the site of mycobacterial infection, the more rapid change of pleural cytokines as well as pleural macrophage phenotype could be valuable prognostic biomarkers to monitor the efficiency of antibiotics treatment in TB patients with tuberculous pleuritis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patients and study design</title><p id="Par17">A total 171 adult patients with tuberculous pleuritis were enrolled in this study.
