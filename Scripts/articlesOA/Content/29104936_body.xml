<sec sec-type="intro" id="s0"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most of the 1.5 million annual deaths due to tuberculosis (TB) result from activation of latent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. Consequently, an important public health goal is to identify individuals who are progressing from latent infection to active disease before they become symptomatic and contagious. Existing diagnostics for <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection, which rely on adaptive immune responses, such as delayed hypersensitivity or cytokine release by antigen-specific T cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), fail to meet this challenge (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In contrast, recent transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood cells points to innate immune cells as potential indicators of infection stage (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Among innate immune cells, macrophages are central in tuberculosis pathogenesis: these cells are parasitized by the pathogen, and they participate in establishing and maintaining chronic infection as well as in determining the immunopathology of active disease (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The remarkable functional plasticity of macrophages, which change phenotypes and functions in response to various environmental signals (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), is often explored by monitoring expression of surface protein markers. Thus, it is conceivable that macrophage surface markers and the underlying phenotypes change with the spectrum of tuberculosis infection, presumably reflecting stage-specific microenvironments and cellular functions.</p><p>Multiple classes of surface protein markers have been used for macrophage phenotyping. For example, markers of macrophage polarization, which reflects the cell&#x02019;s activation state, classify macrophages into two broad groups&#x02014;the M1 and the M2 macrophages (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). M1 macrophages participate in defense against intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), including <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), while M2 cells likely create a favorable environment for intracellular microbial growth (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), due in part to reduced antimicrobial effector functions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Other macrophage responses to microbial infections are determined by protein receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Expression of lipid receptors may also provide information about the functional state of macrophages during tuberculosis, since <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection disrupts lipid homeostasis in macrophages (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Thus, a variety of surface markers are available to characterize the relationship between macrophage functional phenotypes and tuberculosis state.</p><p>Another consideration for phenotyping efforts is the source of macrophages. In particular, studies of blood monocytes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) are not preferred, because blood cells reflect systemic effects of infection rather than the lung environment where <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection occurs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The respiratory locale can be examined by studying the macrophages from alveoli and lower airways; however, recovery of alveolar macrophages requires invasive bronchoalveolar lavage, which limits the availability of cells for analysis. A more suitable approach is to recover lower airway macrophages by sputum induction, a noninvasive, highly tolerable practice used for research and clinical management of several lung diseases, including tuberculosis (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To date, such studies have not examined associations between immunophenotypes of macrophages found in sputum and tuberculosis infection state.</p><p>In the present study, we assessed the abundance of nine protein markers on the surface of sputum macrophages that are associated with macrophage polarization, pattern recognition, or lipid metabolism. We compared sputum macrophages from control subjects not latently infected with TB (LTBI&#x02212;), latently infected subjects (LTBI+), and patients diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) to determine whether phenotypes of innate immune cells vary with tuberculosis infection stages. We find the abundance of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on the surface of sputum macrophages varies with tuberculosis infection stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>Population and sample characteristics.</title><p>Ninety-four (61%) of 154 sputum samples yielded sufficient cell numbers (&#x02265;4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> total cells) for flow cytometry.

This result is consistent with the elevated level of TLR2 gene expression in blood cells and in sputum cells from pulmonary tuberculosis patients relative to control subjects (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). While a marker or markers that can conclusively distinguish between active tuberculosis and latent infection remain to be identified, our study unequivocally demonstrates that (i) differences exist in the expression of innate immune markers in relation to tuberculosis state, and (ii) easily obtained sputum macrophages can be used to detect those differences.</p><p>Our work advances immunodiagnostic tuberculosis research on multiple fronts. First, by providing the first evidence for an association between immunophenotypes of macrophages found in sputum and tuberculosis infection state, the present study identifies innate immune cell phenotyping as a promising biomarker discovery space. In contrast, much of tuberculosis biomarker discovery has previously focused largely on adaptive (T cell) immune responses (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), with overall disappointing results (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), despite indications that myeloid cell signatures in blood differ between active tuberculosis and latent infection (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Second, our approach shows the value of characterizing cells in sputum, while previous sputum investigations of pulmonary disease, including tuberculosis, addressed cell differentials and detection of fluid-phase inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Finally, even when sputum cells (but not specifically macrophages) were characterized for expression of genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses associated with tuberculosis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), donors having latent tuberculosis infection with normal chest X rays, who represent the largest reservoir of <italic>M.&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), were not included in the study. Our study strongly supports the possibility that characterization of readily obtainable sputum macrophages for surface protein markers that can be detected by clinical flow cytometry constitutes a novel approach for identification of infection state markers for tuberculosis diagnosis and prognosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Donor recruitment.</title><p>Participants were recruited from two regional chest clinics in Essex and Middlesex Counties, New Jersey.

<italic>V</italic> + &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> CRP + &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> age, where <italic>V</italic> is the disease severity category (cavitation grade) coded 1, 2, or 3 (0, &#x0003c;4, and &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm, respectively [see &#x0201c;Clinical definitions of tuberculosis state&#x0201d;]). Associations between marker levels and disease severity were adjusted for age and CRP. All statistical tests were Wald tests, and robust standard error estimates were used. The threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mSphere.00475-17.1</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S1&#x000a0;</label><p>Distribution of analysis covariates by infection state.
