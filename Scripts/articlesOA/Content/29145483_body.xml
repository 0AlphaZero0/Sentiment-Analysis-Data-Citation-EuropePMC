Five to 15% of infected individuals progress to active TB disease within their lifetimes. A spectrum of clinical disease severity may occur, associated with poorly regulated immune responses, including infection site and systemic inflammation and in some cases excessive inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. TB disease-driven inflammation in the lung is characterized by presence of activated neutrophils, macrophages and lymphoid tissues in infected foci, as well as the presence of soluble inflammatory mediators at sites of disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Peripheral blood transcriptomic profiling of patients with active TB disease demonstrated elevation of inflammatory gene expression pathways, including interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISG), myeloid inflammatory genes, and FC receptor/complement pathway genes [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>There is limited knowledge about blood transcriptomic changes prior to development of clinical TB disease. We recently identified and validated a whole blood transcriptional signature of risk of TB disease, detectable long before disease manifests [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This 16-gene signature likely represents a small fraction of the host immunological changes that characterize progression to active TB disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

We therefore applied a new in-depth transcriptomic, proteomic, and cellular analysis of blood collected from the adolescent cohort that was used to discover the above-mentioned whole blood signature of risk for TB disease.

Since inflammation is known to regulate both myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we sought to investigate changes in peripheral blood cell subsets during progression. First, we investigated kinetic changes in whole blood transcripts associated with granulocytes, monocytes, T cells and B cells. mRNA expression of FFAR2 (a representative granulocyte gene) and CD14 (a representative monocyte gene) were significantly upregulated while CD28 (a representative T cell gene) and CD79A (a representative B cell gene) were downregulated in progressors relative to controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006687.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>).

Particularly striking was that these changes exhibited a spectrum of kinetics, with a minority of responses exhibiting detectable differences 1&#x02013;2 years before diagnosis, and the largest suite of differences between progressors and controls being observed most proximal to TB disease. These data suggest that TB progression is a slow but steady transition from an immunologically quiescent state, via nondiscrete progressive stages of inflammatory perturbation to the highly inflammatory, clinical manifestations (fever, cough, hemoptysis and weight loss) of microbiologically confirmed, active TB disease. Our results suggest that an intermediate <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection state that appears consistent with incipient or subclinical TB in individuals with no other signs of TB disease, can be revealed with blood biomarkers, such as the whole blood signature of risk for TB progression [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and specific elevation of IFN response gene modules and activation of the complement cascade. Our recent report of infants with QFT conversion values which exceeded &#x0003e; 4IU/mL of IFN-&#x003b3; and who were at exceptionally high risk of TB disease within 6 months of QFT conversion [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], support this finding.

Of note, four of the ten individuals with evidence of subclinical disease developed symptomatic active TB within 6 months, suggesting that such individuals are progressing towards clinical disease.</p><p>Our study lends a timeline to the different immunological stages of TB progression. The first of these, detected up to 18 months before TB diagnosis, included elevated expression of the signature of risk genes themselves and expression of IFN responses genes and complement activation more broadly. Although we did not detect elevated levels of soluble IFN&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; or IFN&#x003b3; proteins themselves in plasma from progressors, as was also observed in a proteomic study of TB disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], it is well-established that expression of type I IFNs by <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>-infected macrophages can be activated by bacterial DNA via STING signaling following binding to cGAS [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Further, <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>-induced mitochondrial stress and abundance of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol of infected macrophages were also recently shown to drive IFN&#x003b2; expression [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These papers suggest that the IFN response signature may be directly activated by <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> bacilli. However, our data do not reveal whether the IFN response cascade is induced by type I or II IFNs. Other well-known inducers of type I IFNs, such as viral infections, may also underlie the IFN response and even contribute to a higher risk of progression to active TB [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, influenza infection has been shown to reduce host resistance to <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Plasma protein levels of the established interferon (type I and/or type II)-induced proteins CXCL10, STAT1 and Tryptophanyl-tRNA ligase were up-regulated with kinetics that were consistent with the up-regulation kinetics for the transcriptomic IFN response. Further, increases in protein levels of the inflammatory proteins Calgranulin C, alpha-1-antitrypsin, Myeloblastin, MMP9 and Ficolin-1 were temporally associated with upregulation of the inflammation transcriptomic module. Calgranulin C, and the serine proteases alpha-1-antitrypsin and Myeloblastin are involved in the neutrophil response and have been previously implicated in mycobacteria-induced inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> secreted proteins Ag85 and ESAT-6 have been shown to induce expression of Ficolin-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and MMP-9 [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], respectively. Ficolin-1 is a pattern recognition molecule that can activate complement via the lectin pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and MMP-9 plays an important role in macrophage recruitment and granuloma establishment after <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These data further support the interpretation that the inflammatory responses observed during progression may be directly triggered by increased bacterial replication.</p><p>We also observed a strong complement activation signal during the very early stages of TB progression, which coincided with elevation of the IFN response. In light of the well-described roles of complement components, such as C1, C3 and C4, in <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> recognition and phagocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], these data are also consistent with host innate sensing of <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> in progressors, either via increased pathogen load or greater access to the bacterium. We were not able to establish from our data whether complement was activated through a particular pathway. Mycobacteria are able to activate complement through the antibody-dependent and antibody-independent classical pathways, alternative pathway activation and the lectin pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We observed upregulation of components consistent with activation of the classical pathway via C1q, while levels of total IgG and IgA were also upregulated in progressors. Differential abundance of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin-1 proteins in plasma also implicate activation of the lectin pathway. Finally, while a number of proteins involved in activation of the alternative pathway were elevated in progressors, these can also indicate complement activation by any pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Complement may also be activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli and, in turn, components of the complement cascade are known regulators of inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our data thus highlight that the complex interplay between <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>, inflammation, antibody responses and complement activation needs greater exploration.</p><p>Secondary to these IFN responses and complement activation during progression, increased myeloid cell inflammation, platelet activation and blood coagulation, with concurrent enrichment of peripheral blood monocytes and other myeloid cells were observed 12 to 6 months before disease diagnosis. Finally, within the most proximal 6 months before TB disease, changes in lymphocytes, including suppressed T and B cells and enrichment in neutrophils, were detected. The latter coincided with activation of tissue remodeling pathways that included elevated expression of several MMPs. High MMP concentrations correlate with lung immunopathology in TB disease, demonstrating the role of MMPs as effectors of matrix destruction in TB [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We speculate that our data suggest that breakdown of the extracellular lung matrix may occur months before clinical TB manifestation. If so, intervention during early stages of progression may allow prevention of pulmonary caseation, necrosis and cavitation, which are associated with poor treatment outcome [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of a recent study of blood transcriptional signatures in the cynomolgus macaque model of TB [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Our results support this interpretation and add a timeline to the transition through apparent stages within the spectrum. It should be noted that transition from quiescent infection, through incipient and subclinical TB to active pulmonary disease in different individuals was highly heterogeneous. A limitation of our study is that the time of exposure and/or <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection in most progressors and controls was unknown, precluding interpretation of the events that precede establishment of <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection.</p><p>Finally, our T cell transcriptomic results demonstrate that progression was associated with modulation of the functional states of T cells, particularly suppressed expression of genes associated with the Th17 compartment [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in progressors that expressed the whole blood signature of risk for TB. Systemic expression of IFN response genes that comprise the signature of risk occurred concomitantly with Th17 inhibition.

This link between high expression of ISG as measured by the signature of risk of TB, and an alteration in T cell functional capacity was confirmed by analysis of an independent cohort. In South African adults who expressed the signature for risk of TB in whole blood, BCG revaccination induced significantly lower frequencies of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup> and decreased proportions of IL-17-expressing IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. A major implication of this result is that immune responsiveness to vaccination may be modulated by the inflammatory milieu associated with progression to active TB, and even other immune modulations that result in systemic persistent expression of IFN response genes, such as viral infections. Further research is required to dissect the mechanistic link between inflammatory and cellular events that may underlie this observation, and to understand the true implications of this finding.</p><p>Our study shows that sequential inflammatory dynamics precede TB disease manifestation characterized by specific alterations in blood transcriptomic, proteomic and cellular signatures.

Danish strain 1331 BCG Vaccine SSI (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark), the BCG vaccine used in the South African national immunization program and one of the most widely administered BCG vaccines worldwide, was administered intradermally at an adult dose of 2 to 8 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs. INH (Westward Pharmaceutical Corporation, Eatontown, NJ, USA) was administered daily at 5mg/kg rounded up to the nearest 100mg (maximum dose 300 mg/day), and INH adherence was monitored by pill counts at clinic visits and random urine INH metabolite testing (18). All participants provided written, informed consent. Whole blood was collected in PAXGene tubes and in Sodium-Heparin tubes from participants and processed within 45 minutes of phlebotomy, as previously described (19), at enrollment, 1 month after isozianid preventive therapy initiation, at BCG vaccination, at 3 and 5 weeks, and 1 year post-vaccination. RNA was isolated from PAXGene tubes as described above. Heparinized blood was stimulated and processed for measurement of T cell responses by whole blood intracellular cytokine staining (WB-ICS) assay, as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1006687.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The signature of risk of TB was measured in samples collected before BCG re-vaccination and the functionality of the T cell response to BCG revaccination was measured 3 weeks after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>ACS study protocol, including sample collection, utilization and analyses, were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town.
