<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With an estimated 1.8 million TB-related annual deaths worldwide, approximately one-third of the global population harboring latent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, and significant numbers of drug-resistant cases, there is an urgent and compelling need for more sophisticated diagnostic and treatment options for tuberculosis (TB) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is an intracellular pathogen that mainly resides within macrophages. The multi-tiered immune response elicited upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is complex, and our understanding of the requirements for protective immunity remain incomplete (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Observations in humans and mouse models have firmly established essential roles for interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;)-mediated T cell functions in the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and IL-1 are critical contributors to the immune defense against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Recently described gene signatures in blood of patients with active TB disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) are being explored extensively for their utility as biomarkers for the reliable diagnosis of active TB, tracking of at-risk individuals, and monitoring of treatment outcome. Additionally, the discovery of IFN-related gene signatures in patients with active TB disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) has created significant momentum behind investigation of the innate immune pathways and pathophysiological consequences of type I IFN expression during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. While IFN-&#x003b3; is the sole type II IFN, type I IFNs in humans comprise several IFN-&#x003b1; subtypes, IFN-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003c9;, IFN-&#x003b5;, IFN-&#x003c4;, and IFN-&#x003ba; (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). All known type I IFNs signal through a common receptor, IFNAR, which consists of the low-affinity IFNAR1 and the high-affinity IFNAR2 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It is increasingly appreciated that type I IFNs not only play a significant role in the antiviral response but are also a central aspect of the host response to bacterial infections (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In this context, type I IFNs appear to promote or impair pathogen control and disease pathology depending on the infectious agent, acute or chronic state of the infection, and possibly also the model system studied (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Evidence from human case reports and animal models suggests complex contributions of type I IFNs to the host response during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection as both protective and detrimental roles for the host have been described. The impact of type I IFNs and related immune response networks on pathology and pathogen control during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection are also assessed with an eye to host-directed interventions in TB. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of TB patient blood gene expression signatures, and the definition of innate immune drivers and immunological consequences of type I IFN expression in the context of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Blood Gene Expression Signatures in the Quest for TB Biomarkers</title><p>There are increasing numbers of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies exploring whole blood gene expression in TB patients as a potential diagnostic indicator of disease status, manifestation, and responsiveness to treatment [reviewed in more detail elsewhere, e.g. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)]. While the individual genes identified across the various studies are remarkably discordant (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), overall signatures returned from many of these studies have implicated IFN signaling (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, independent meta-analyses of publicly available datasets have expressed different views on the dominance and robustness of IFN signatures in active TB (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). An overarching goal of current studies is the identification of minimal gene signatures in global gene expression profiles that can be utilized as reliable TB diagnostic markers in clinical settings. Potential applications of this approach include distinguishing active TB from latent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection and other infections; monitoring of treatment success/failure; and predicting risk of developing active disease (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Some, but not all, of these proposed minimal marker combinations contain IFN-regulated genes. The &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; approaches currently being pursued clearly indicate innate and adaptive immune response signatures that significantly enhance our current understanding of peripheral host responses during active and latent TB. Consideration of whether or not these molecular signatures are unique to TB is important when designing and interpreting global host response profiles for the derivation of reliable diagnostic markers. Consideration of potential confounding factors, as well as inclusion of unrelated disease controls cohorts, is also critical for success in these endeavors.</p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major risk factor for development of active TB. Approximately 1/3 of HIV-positive individuals worldwide are latently infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Currently, 55% of notified TB cases are HIV-positive and approximately 22% of TB-related deaths occur in HIV-positive individuals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Due to significant virus-associated immunological alterations in HIV-positive individuals, the utility of minimal gene signatures in distinguishing active from latent TB may be compromised in these cases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Encouragingly, signatures that distinguish active TB from latent TB in HIV-positive and -negative individuals are emerging (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Additionally, type II diabetes is being increasingly recognized as a significant comorbidity that adversely affects TB severity, treatment responsiveness, and outcome in high TB burden countries (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, exploration of molecular signatures to better understand the nature of the TB/type II diabetes interaction is an important upcoming challenge. Notably, a recent study that compared blood transcriptomics in South-Indian TB patients with and without type II diabetes concluded that the utility of blood gene expression markers in the diagnosis of TB might not be confounded by type II diabetes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Independent confirmation of these findings in populations where high type II diabetes and high TB burden intersect will be of great significance for the development of new molecular marker-based TB diagnostics.</p><p>Interferon-associated genes are present not only in blood gene expression signatures reported for active TB, but also in patients with the granulomatous diseases meliodosis and sarcoidosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This suggests that peripheral blood gene expression signatures may be shaped by responses to tissue pathology rather than a specific underlying cause. Moreover, Blankley et al. highlight that severity of clinical symptoms in TB patients is associated with the magnitude of gene expression, regardless of the site of infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Nevertheless, comparisons of global response patterns in active and latent TB with other infectious or inflammatory conditions have yielded encouraging results, as they suggest that molecular signatures that reliably discriminate active TB can be identified (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Patient cohort-based profiling in search of reliable TB diagnostics calls for careful study design, inclusion of clinical metadata, and clear definition of patient and control cohorts (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Continuing developments in the analysis of &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; data, including statistical frameworks, machine learning, multi-platform integration, and network analyses, will be important assets in defining molecular markers that perform robustly independent of age, gender, ethnicity, and comorbidities.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Molecular Pathways That Drive Type I IFN Production in Mycobacteria-Infected Host Cells</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection induces type I IFN expression in human and mouse macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The serine/threonine kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), is a central driver of type I IFN expression in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected host cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). TBK1 facilitates phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), and IRF3 and IRF5 have been reported to facilitate type I IFN expression in mycobacteria-infected host cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). IFN-&#x003b2; expression requires collaboration of IRFs with other transcription factors including NF-&#x003ba;B, ATF-2, and c-Jun (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), emphasizing the complexity of host signaling events that shape type I IFN expression. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have been linked to TBK1 phosphorylation and type I IFN expression in response to mycobacterial infection include the Nod-like receptor NOD2, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) either directly or <italic>via</italic> activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), as well as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Innate immune signaling pathways that drive type I IFN responses in mycobacteria-infected host cells. During infection, the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> ESX-1 secretion system facilitates disruption of the phagosomal membrane contributing to mitochondrial stress and leakage of mycobacterial products into the cytosol. These products include the cyclic dinucleotides cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) and cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), DNA, and <italic>N</italic>-glycolylated muramyl dipeptide (MDP). Recognition of cytosolic mitochondrial and mycobacterial DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) initiates formation of the second messenger cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP and bacterial cyclic dinucleotides interact with dimeric STING on the endoplasmic reticulum or the STING-accessory molecule DDX41. STING activation and relocation to the perinuclear Golgi initiates recruitment and activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and possibly also IKK&#x003b5;. Subsequent activation and nuclear translocation of the functionally active dimeric transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 and NF-&#x003ba;B drives expression of type I IFNs. cGAMP may also access uninfected cells <italic>via</italic> gap junctions, triggering STING activation and type I IFN expression in bystander cells. MDP is recognized by NOD2, which leads to RIP2-mediated activation of TBK1, culminating in IRF5 dimerization and nuclear translocation. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolate BTB 02-171 induces type I IFN expression dependent on TLR4. It is inferred that the induction pathway is similar to the known toll-like receptor (TLR)4 endosomal signaling pathway. However, this awaits experimental confirmation. <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> Bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) lacks ESX-1, yet, can elicit type I IFN expression. Cyclic dinucleotide-mediated STING activation independent of ESX-1 has been described.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-08-01633-g001"/></fig><sec id="S3-1"><title>The Mycobacterial Type VII Secretion System ESX-1 Facilitates Activation of Cytosolic Surveillance Pathways and Type I IFN Expression</title><p>Early studies established that induction of type I IFN responses by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was greatly diminished if the genomic region of difference-1 (RD-1), the RD-1 encoded type VII ESAT-6 secretion system 1 (ESX-1), or its key components were deleted (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The ESX-1 secretion system is a major virulence determinant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that mediates secretion of mycobacterial products that shape host responses to infection (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). ESX-1 may also directly affect phagosome membrane integrity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Co-localization studies with galectin-3, a marker of damaged membranes, and ubiquitin suggest that within 24&#x02009;h of infection approximately 10% of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteria are in contact with the cytoplasm and that this is dependent on ESX-1 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).

Polyubiquitination of the NOD2-effector RIP2 was significantly diminished upon infection with ESX-1-deficient <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when compared to wild-type bacteria, identifying RIP2 as a major downstream effector of NOD2 in the recognition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The unusual mycobacterial <italic>N</italic>-glycolylated muramyl dipeptide is a driver of NOD2-mediated type I IFN responses <italic>via</italic> RIP2 and IRF5, but not IRF3 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Reports addressing the role of NOD2 in the host control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in the mouse model <italic>in vivo</italic> have returned varying results. Whereas NOD2-deficient (<italic>Card15</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice were not impaired in their ability to control infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in two independent studies (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), one study reported impaired T helper 1 (Th1) responses associated with slightly impaired survival and a modest increase in bacterial burden late during infection (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Similarly, reports on human polymorphisms in the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene and susceptibility to, or protection from TB have returned varying results and will require further validation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>NOD2- and RIP2-deficiency only partially ablated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b1; expression (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), suggesting that additional molecular pathways of type I IFN induction exist. Several recent independent studies identified cGAS and STING as central drivers of IFN-&#x003b2; expression in human and murine macrophages during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). STING contains four transmembrane domains that anchor it into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, as well as a large C-terminal domain involved in binding of TBK1 and IRF3. Binding of one molecule of cyclic di-nucleotide of either host or bacterial origin to STING dimers facilitates TBK1 and IRF3 activation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Endogenous 2&#x02032;3&#x02032;-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is a second messenger generated by cGAS upon binding of cytoplasmic DNA. This cytoplasmic surveillance mechanism is a major driver of STING activation and type I IFN responses. Both cGAS- and STING-deficient human and mouse macrophages are impaired in their ability to express IFN-&#x003b2; in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The underlying mechanisms that trigger this pathway are under intense investigation. It has been suggested that mycobacterial DNA gains access to the host cell cytoplasm and directly binds to cGAS, a process facilitated by ESX-1-dependent phagosome damage (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Others reported that the extent of macrophage IFN-&#x003b2; expression in response to different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates correlated with mitochondrial stress, with no observable differences in the proportions of bacteria associated with damaged phagosomes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). These observations suggest that the extent of mitochondrial DNA released during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection may contribute to cGAS-dependent activation of type I IFN expression by macrophages and determine the extent of the type I IFN response (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Further amplification of STING-driven type I IFN expression may occur in uninfected bystander cells through shuttling of cGAMP through tight junction proteins (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).</p><p>In addition, bacterial pathogens generate cyclic di-nucleotides that can activate STING independent of cGAS (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> di-adenylate cyclase (disA or dacA) synthesizes c-di-AMP, which triggers IFN-&#x003b2; expression in macrophages and dendritic cells through STING activation, either through direct binding or <italic>via</italic> engagement of DEAD-box helicase 4 (DDX4) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). IFN-&#x003b2; expression in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis disA</italic> mutant bacteria was reduced compared to wild-type bacteria. Conversely, <italic>disA</italic> overexpression in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CDC1551 and Erdman enhanced IFN-&#x003b2; expression (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The discovery that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> expresses a phosphodiesterase, cdnP, that not only cleaves bacterial c-di-AMP and c-di-CMP but also the host-derived STING activator 2&#x02032;3&#x02032;-cGAMP (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), is in keeping with the remarkable adaptation of this bacterium to its intracellular niche within the host. Accordingly, a <italic>cdnP M. tuberculosis</italic> transposon mutant induced elevated IFN-&#x003b2;, whereas <italic>cdnP</italic> overexpression impaired IFN-&#x003b2; expression by macrophages (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Of note, the elevated IFN-&#x003b2; response elicited by <italic>cdnP</italic> deficient <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteria was independent of NOD2 (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), indicating that these cytoplasmic detection pathways are operating in parallel. Importantly, however, modulation of <italic>disA</italic> and <italic>cdnP</italic> expression did not only affect type I IFN expression but also pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF, IL-6, and IL-1 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). These cytokines are important for the immune control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection and can counter-regulate type I IFN expression (discussed below). This impact on the balance of key cytokines that are essential to control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> may account for the enhanced or attenuated virulence of the respective <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mutants <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Moreover, the ability and extent of c-di-AMP production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as well as cGAS and STING activation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected macrophages have been linked to autophagy (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). It will be valuable to further investigate molecular mechanisms of the engagement of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and cell autonomous defense mechanisms by mycobacteria-derived c-di-AMP, which may involve other c-di-AMP-sensors such as DDX4 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and RECON (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>).</p><p>Despite the profound contributions of cGAS and STING to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced type I IFN responses and autophagy activation reported by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), bacterial burden in infected organs of mice deficient in cGAS or STING expression was comparable to wild-type controls (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).

Whether this is linked to STING-independent functions of cGAS such as impaired autophagy (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) remains to be established. Moreover, roles for DDX4 (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and RECON (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) in regulating host responses and pathogen control during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection remain to be defined.</p></sec><sec id="S3-2"><title>ESX-1-Independent Induction of Type I IFNs in Mycobacterial Infection</title><p>While the data discussed above support a central role for the ESX-1 secretion system in the induction of type I IFN expression in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected host cells, there is compelling evidence for mycobacteria-induced type I IFN responses in the absence of ESX-1.

TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins that localize to the cell membrane or endosomal membranes. They sense microbial components in the extracellular environment or internalized materials in the &#x0201c;extracellular&#x0201d; space of intracellular trafficking compartments, but not in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Dimerization of TLRs upon ligand binding facilitates recruitment of adaptor proteins and the initiation of intracellular signaling (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). MyD88-dependent signaling from endosomal TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 activates IRF-7 and results in the expression of type I IFNs (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). TLR4 internalization into endosomes upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide engages TRIF and TRAM, facilitating IKK&#x003b5; and TBK-1 activation. Subsequent phosphorylation of IRF-3 leads to the expression of type I IFNs (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Recent data suggest that TLR2 may similarly induce TRIF- and TRAM-dependent signaling from endosomes (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Initial studies concluded that TLRs are not a major driver of type I IFN responses during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression by mouse macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was independent of TLR2, exhibited a minor defect in <italic>Trif<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic><sup>/</sup><italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, and appeared to be negatively regulated by TLR4 (comparison of C3H/HeN versus C3H/HeJ) and MyD88 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A separate study showed that macrophage <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression upon infection with the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> clinical isolate 1254 was equivalent between wild-type cells and macrophages deficient in <italic>Tlr4, Tlr2, Tirap, Myd88</italic>, or <italic>Trif</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In contrast, TLR4-driven <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression induced by the lineage 2 <italic>M.&#x02009;tuberculosis</italic> isolate BTB 02-171 was associated with TLR4-dependent enhanced virulence in mice (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). While the TLR4 ligand in strain BTB 02-171 remains to be identified, these observations invite speculation that TLR4 signaling in this context may occur from maturing mycobacteria-containing phagosomes or endosomal compartments during infection. Whether such signaling engages TRIF, and/or also occurs downstream of other TLRs implicated in human susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, remains to be established. These findings encourage investigations into the TLR-activating properties of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates dominant in populations or ethnic groups that show associations of TB susceptibility or severity with polymorphisms in TLR4 (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), TLR2 and its co-receptors (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>), as well as TLR8 (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) and TLR9 (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>).

(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and subsequently several other studies firmly establish that IFNs flavor the peripheral immune response in patients with active TB. It is important to note that both type I and type II IFNs are implicated in driving these IFN signatures, especially those attributable to STAT1 homodimerization-stimulated gamma-IFN activation sequence (GAS)-regulated gene expression, which occurs in response to both type I and type II IFNs (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>).</p><sec id="S4-1"><title>Impact of Type I IFN Signaling in Mice and Humans on Pathogen Control and Disease Outcome</title><sec id="S4-1-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The functional consequences of type I IFN signaling in the context of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection are incompletely understood. The evidence so far suggests that the impact of type I IFN signaling on host resistance and disease severity are determined by the immune competence of the host, with contributions by the bacterial strain. The degree of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; expression in mice has been correlated with the virulence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). <italic>Ifnar1</italic>-deficiency in mice with a <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-susceptible genetic background (A129, 129S2) enhanced host survival upon infection with the high type I IFN-inducing hypervirulent HN878 strain but also the low IFN-inducing strain CDC1551 (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). <italic>Ifnar1</italic>-deficiency also partially rescued accelerated mortality in the highly susceptible <italic>Il1r</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with the moderate type I IFN-inducer, H37Rv (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). These data suggest that endogenous type I IFN signaling impairs host resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in susceptible hosts. A study in C57BL/6 mice, a mouse strain more resistant to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, reported equivalent survival rates between <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 mice infected with the hypervirulent HN878 and other <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains, despite diminished bacterial burden in the lungs of infected <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Other studies compared C57BL/6 and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during infection with H37Rv and the hypervirulent, high type I IFN-inducing BTB 02-171 strain for 70 and &#x0003e;200&#x02009;days of infection. As neither C57BL/6 wild-type nor <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice succumbed to the infection during these time frames, the impact of <italic>Ifnar1</italic> single deficiency on survival upon infection with these <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains remained unclear (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Of note, <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on C57BL/6 background showed diminished bacterial burden and pathology as well as a minor survival advantage during long-term infection (&#x0003e;200&#x02009;days) with <italic>Mycobacterium africanum</italic> (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). While <italic>M. africanum</italic> is a poor inducer of type I IFN responses (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), these data suggest that type I IFN signaling may subvert effective long-term host control of this infection in a relatively resistant host.</p><p>Administration of neutralizing anti-IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; antibodies to resistant B6D2/F1 mice prior to and upon infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> HN878 provided a long-term survival benefit, associated with lower IFN-&#x003b1; expression and STAT1 activation in lung tissue, albeit without significant effects on bacterial burden (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). This suggests that pre-existing type I IFN responses in the host at the time of exposure may influence the outcome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. This is supported by the observation that pre-infection of mice with influenza A virus accelerated host death (&#x0003e;160&#x02009;days of <italic>M. tuberculosi</italic>s infection). This was associated with exacerbated inflammation and some transient early and late elevation of bacterial burden, which was abrogated in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Moreover, artificial exacerbation of type I IFN responses in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected resistant mice, e.g., by intranasal administration of IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; or the stabilized synthetic TLR3 agonist pICLC, significantly impaired host survival, exacerbated lung inflammation, and impaired the host&#x02019;s ability to restrict <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>).</p><p>While the reasons for variable effects on bacterial burden and host survival in the abovementioned studies remain to be elucidated, the evidence gathered through genetic and exogenous modulation indicate detrimental effects of type I IFN signaling in mouse models of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection across a spectrum of host genetic backgrounds and mycobacterial strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, there is evidence that type I IFN signaling exerts some protective effects in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;. Mice that lack the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor are highly susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, as reflected by poor host control of the bacteria, extensive pathology, and accelerated death. Additional <italic>Ifnar1</italic> deficiency in <italic>Ifngr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice further impaired survival suggesting that type I IFN signaling played a non-redundant protective role relatively early during infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and BTB 02-171 that was only apparent in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). These observations suggest that the relative balance of type I and type II IFN functions defines host control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and pathology during the infection. It is worth noting that in mice infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG, <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, type I IFNs appear to have protective roles (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>), encouraging further investigations into the functional contributions of type I IFNs to host protection across a wider spectrum of mycobacteria.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Perturbations of type I IFN signaling in mouse models and consequences for infection with bacteria of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse strain/Mtb susceptible (S) or resistant (R)</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type I IFN perturbation</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mycobacteria</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type I IFN response</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bacterial burden</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pathology</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survival</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="12" colspan="1">C57BL/6 (R)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">H37Rv</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reduced IFN-&#x003b2; in lung homogenate 18 and 25&#x02009;days p.i.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparable to WT on days 18 and 25 p.i.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No mortality in WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (day 70 p.i.)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BTB 02-171</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparable to WT on days 24 and 27 p.i.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparable to WT at day 27 p.i.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No mortality in WT and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (day 50 p.i.)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Erdman</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparable to WT on days 1, 10, and 21 p.i. in the lungs.

However, there are several clinical case reports that inhaled or subcutaneous administration of IFN-&#x003b1; to tuberculosis patients, in conjunction with co-administration of antimycobacterial antibiotics, improved clinical symptoms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). It is important to note that these patients were selected due to failure of conventional treatment options and/or recurrent disease, and often received IFN-&#x003b1; late in their infection. Underlying unidentified immune deficiencies may thus have been a confounding factor. Moreover, reports of therapeutic effects of IFN-&#x003b1; administration to patients that presented with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections suggest contributions of type I IFNs to the antimycobacterial defense in humans in the context of genetically manifested IFN-&#x003b3; signaling deficiencies (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>).

Recombinant IFN-&#x003b1; is commonly used in the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. While some studies suggest that long-term administration of recombinant IFN-&#x003b1; does not bear a major risk for TB reactivation (<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>), case reports of TB reactivation associated with IFN-&#x003b1; therapy demand caution in the clinical management of co-infected individuals (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>).

Thus, cell-specific targeting of the cellular source of IL-10 that impairs host control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication may be of interest for host-directed intervention but requires detailed characterization of the functionalities and impact of IL-10-producing host cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2-4"><title>TNF-&#x003b1;</title><p>The increased risk of TB reactivation in individuals undergoing TNF neutralizing therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases underpins the central role for this cytokine in the host control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, which is further supported by mouse studies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). Macrophages deficient for IFNAR signaling showed diminished TNF expression in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, which was interpreted as a promoting role for endogenous type I IFN responses in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced TNF response (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>).

(<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). The reasons for the apparent differences between individual studies are not immediately obvious, but may be attributable to the different time points analyzed postinfection and the different models systems studied. These observations may indicate, however, that the concentration, source, and timing of the type I IFN response direct TNF responses in the context of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2-5"><title>IL-1, Eicosanoids, Nitric Oxide (NO), and Neutrophils</title><p>IL-1 signaling is an important driver of host resistance against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in humans and mice (<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>).

As endogenous and exogenously added type I IFNs drive NO production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected macrophages (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>), type I IFN signaling may also interfere with IL-1 processing. It is interesting to note that NO-mediated thiol nitrosylation inhibited assembly and activation of the NLRP3 but not AIM2 inflammasome (<xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). AIM2 has been reported to be dispensable for IL-1&#x003b2; production by murine dendritic cells infected with virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis in vitro</italic>. In contrast, AIM2 was required for IL-1&#x003b2; release induced by <italic>Mycobacterium smegmantis, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kansasii</italic> and, to a lesser extent, the attenuated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>). Intriguingly, infection of DCs with virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> prior to infection with <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> reduced the IL-1&#x003b2; release, which was associated with an impaired IFN-&#x003b2; response. The authors concluded that virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> actively suppressed AIM2 activation by a mechanism that required <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ESX-1 (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>). Yet, AIM2-deficient mice infected intratracheally with a high dose of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv displayed elevated bacterial loads in the lung and liver 4&#x02009;weeks postinfection accompanied by exacerbated pathology, impaired IL-18 and IL-10 production, as well as an impaired antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived IFN-g response.

This suggests that alternative mechanisms of pro-IL-1 processing during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> exist, and that AIM2 contributions to the host control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection may exceed processing of pro-IL-1&#x003b2;.</p><p>An emerging pathway of type I IFN-mediated suppression of effective immune control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> occurs <italic>via</italic> dysregulation of IL-1-controlled eicosanoid lipid mediators (<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). In mice, IL-1 receptor signaling enhanced the ratio of host-protective prostaglandin E2 over host-detrimental 5-lipoxygenase products such as lipoxin A4 (<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Type I IFN signaling counter-regulates this IL-1-driven process, and conversely, IL-1 signaling impairs the type I IFN response (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Poor control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in various mouse models is associated with an extensive neutrophil response in the lung. Pathogen control and host survival can be improved by neutrophil depletion and <italic>Ifnar1</italic>-deficiency in a susceptible mouse strain, which is associated with a shift of intracellular <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burden from permissive neutrophils toward monocytes (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>, <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>). Recent findings suggest that in a permissive environment, 12/15-lipoxygenase products drive neutrophil infiltration into infected lungs, which is associated with poor host restriction of mycobacterial replication in a nutrient-rich environment (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>). In the absence of NO production (<italic>Nos2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice), this process was driven by inflammasome-dependent IL-1 production (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>) linking back to the inhibitory effects of NO on inflammasome assembly (<xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>).</p><p>Associations of IL-1, type I IFN, eicosanoids, neutrophil infiltration, and SNPs in associated genes with disease severity and treatment responsiveness in human TB patients (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>, <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>) underpin a dynamic cytokine network that balances the protective or detrimental roles of eicosanoid lipid mediators and neutrophil functions in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.

One of the main questions remaining is which cells are the key producers of type I IFNs during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> evidence strongly suggests that host cells that harbor <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteria such as macrophages and myeloid DCs are sources of type I IFN during infection. In the context of the close interactions between infected and uninfected cells within granulomas, the concept of dinucleotide-mediated STING-activation in bystander cells warrants further exploration as it may allow for type I IFN expression not only in myeloid cells but also in T and B cells. Moreover, mice infected with hypervirulent, high type I IFN-inducing HN878 harbored elevated numbers of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in their lungs (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Human peripheral blood pDCs responded with high IFN-&#x003b1; production to stimulation with high concentrations of mycobacterial DNA (<xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>). However, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured pDCs expressed little to no type I IFNs when co-cultured with <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic> or <italic>M. bovis</italic>-BCG-infected myeloid DCs (<xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>, <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>). Advanced single cell functional profiling in TB granulomas and the employment of sensitive IFN reporter animal models are just two approaches that may provide a better understanding of the dynamics and cellular sources of type I IFN expression during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection both at the site of infection and in the periphery. Individual type I IFNs exhibit distinct functions in various homeostatic and pathological contexts, which has at least in part been attributed to varying ligand affinity, stability of the receptor complex, and unique signaling capacity of IFN-&#x003b2; through IFNAR1 (<xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). Thus, insights into the spatial and temporal expression of individual members of the type I IFN family may hold the key to providing context for some of the apparent opposing roles of type I IFN signaling deduced from model systems and patient observations. As the discoveries around blood gene expression signatures in patients with active TB disease are being explored for suitable biomarkers, they also raise questions related to TB pathophysiology. For example: are IFN signatures related to neutrophils in the periphery (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>) a natural consequence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in humans, or an indication of disease susceptibility of the individual due to a propensity to mount a neutrophil response upon encounter with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>? How reflective is the peripheral gene expression profile of the response mounted locally at the site of infection or within the relevant secondary lymphoid organs? Longitudinal analyses and immune profiling in at-risk individuals (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) will provide valuable insights, and suitable animal models are key for functional context. While type I IFN signaling may contribute to some aspects of the host defense against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, it is clear that extensive type I IFN responses, e.g. in the context of viral infections (<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>), promote pathology to the detriment of the host. Nevertheless, the reported therapeutic benefits of type I IFN administration in conjunction with antimycobacterial antibiotics warrants detailed exploration to establish whether this is reflective of a patient immune status permissive to potential antimycobacterial activities of type I IFN or whether IFNs facilitate mycobacterial replication rendering them more susceptible to antibiotics. Understanding whether and when type I IFNs are &#x0201c;friend or foe&#x0201d; in the context of mycobacterial infections will define their place in the quest for tailored host-directed therapeutic interventions in TB.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the critical review of the literature and writing of the manuscript.
