<p content-type="flushleft">There is an urgent need to improve antitubercular treatment strategies. Tuberculosis (TB) continues to result in close to two million deaths worldwide on an annual basis, and is the single biggest killer of AIDS patients (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Additionally, &#x0223c;10% of newly diagnosed patients exhibited disease with some resistance to anti-TB drugs, ranging from multidrug-resistant to extensively drug-resistant TB (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The failure to control TB stems from the lack of relatively poor understanding of both pathogenesis and the host factors that contribute to the susceptibility of TB disease. However, nonhuman primates (NHPs) recapitulate the complete breadth of the lung pathology and granulomatous responses that are emblematic of human disease (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The granuloma is the site of host<italic>&#x02013;Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> interactions, which either result in acute infection or the control of infection in a latent state (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> modulates these immune interactions to inhibit mycobacterial killing and therefore promote long-term survival of the bacilli.</p><p>The expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is dramatically enhanced in macaque granulomata (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). IDO catabolizes Tryptophan (Trp) to kynurenine (Kyn) and other metabolites, and acts to suppress the immune response, particularly the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell production of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Induction of host IDO is a nascent strategy to starve pathogens of Trp, an essential amino acid (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can synthesize its own Trp de novo (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), potentially an adaption for its survival during Trp catabolism by IDO in host phagocytes. Therefore, IDO production has little effect on mycobacterial metabolism and yet impacts protective host immune responses.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that increased IDO1 expression correlates with higher bacterial burden. Furthermore, IDO is particularly enriched in the macrophage-rich inner layer of the granuloma (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This spatial expression may prevent lymphocytes, which are predominant in the external layers of the granuloma, from reaching the infected phagocytes, and this inhibition may further promote bacterial survival. We therefore hypothesize that the highly organized granulomas seen in NHPs and humans may be advantageous to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> due to this spatial exclusion of immune-protective lymphocytes. As such, the IDO pathway represents a potential target for host-directed therapy (HDT) to augment the control of TB.</p><p>Inhibitors of IDO activity [e.g., 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT, D-1MT)] are being evaluated as anticancer drugs. In this study, we demonstrated that D-1MT&#x02013;mediated IDO inhibition resulted in somewhat increased <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> killing, improved clinical signs of disease, increased lymphoid follicles and proliferation of pulmonary lymphocytes, and was associated with a drastic reorganization of the granuloma that allowed lymphocyte trafficking into the macrophage-tropic internal layers. These results lend significant credence to the utilization of IDO inhibitors as an HDT strategy adjunctive to anti-<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> chemotherapy (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>IDO1 Is Expressed in a <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Burden-Dependent Manner in Infected Phagocytes and Experimental Hosts.</title><p>We first studied whether IDO levels are induced in a <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burden-dependent manner.

Furthermore, IDO expression levels were highly correlated with lung CFUs (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.68) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). We have recently shown that most animals with latent TB infection (LTBI) that were subsequently coinfected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), reactivated (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In coinfected animals, IDO levels largely correlated with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burdens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). Animals with TB exhibited an &#x0223c;20- to 40-fold IDO induction relative to baseline, whereas the expression was unperturbed in animals that did not reactivate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>) with high degree of concordance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.48) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>H</italic></xref>). To effectively demonstrate IDO induction as a correlate of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burden, we measured its expression in macaques receiving chemotherapy. Daily oral administration of moxifloxacin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, a multidrug-resistant regimen in humans, reduced IDO1 expression relative to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). Consistent with the above findings, low IDO expression was observed in animals infected with nonpathogenic <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) strains <italic>Mtb&#x00394;sigH</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>&#x02206;<italic>dosR</italic> (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). Lungs of animals infected with a high dose of <italic>Mtb</italic>&#x00394;<italic>sigH</italic> mutant had reduced IDO levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>), which again demonstrates that IDO levels were driven by uncontrolled <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication. Unlike <italic>Mtb</italic>&#x02206;<italic>sigH</italic>, <italic>Mtb</italic>&#x02206;<italic>dosR</italic> exhibits only partial attenuation, and adaptive immune responses are required for its control (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), likely explaining the intermediate expression of IDO in animals infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>&#x02206;<italic>dosR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic></xref>).

We tested the importance of IDO signaling in vivo in acutely infected macaques by treating the animals with D-1MT, a specific inhibitor of IDO activity. Treatment was initiated 1 wk after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d35e607">Fig. S2</xref>). The progression of TB was significantly altered in treated macaques, as reflected by clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Whereas all of the control animals had to be killed within 5 wk of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals survived until 8 wk, exhibited significantly delayed kinetics, and lower levels of serum C reactive protein (CRP) compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, treated animals exhibited limited weight loss over time compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This finding was consistent with the low bacterial burdens detected in treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2 <italic>C&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). CFUs were determined from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in two groups each at week 1 (the time when treatment was initiated), week 3 (i.e., 2 wk after treatment), and at the end point, at which time <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CFUs were also assessed in the lung tissues. The control animals exhibited significantly higher <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burdens (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in BAL at week 3 and in the terminal lung samples compared with the D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals. BAL data are shown for at least three animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). However, the CFU levels in the BAL did not differ between the two groups at week 1, before initiating treatment, indicating that the initial infections were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The total bacterial burdens in terminal lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>) and bronchial lymph node (BLN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>) were significantly lower in D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals than in the control animals (&#x0003e;1 log, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The bacterial burdens were also lower in liver, kidney, spleen in D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>). D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals presented with fewer granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>) relative to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>) and exhibited significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) lung pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>H</italic></xref>).

Kyn is one of the end products of IDO enzymatic activity. Numerous studies have implicated it in the immunosuppressive function of this signaling pathway (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). It is also known to be a ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

Toward this end, we studied if the demarcation between the necrotic center and the lymphocytic layer was more disrupted in the lesions derived from IDO-inhibitor&#x02013;treated animals relative to untreated animals where it was well defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).

Thus, relative to control animals, the total number of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells per lesion and their migration from the lymphocytic layer to the necrotic center of granuloma were higher in D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>). These results clearly indicate that IDO signaling affects T cell infiltration into the necrotic centers of granulomas.

The effector role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection has recently been described (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

Approximately 60% of these cells in lesions from D-1MT&#x02013;treated animals were found to be positive for granzyme B, which was significantly greater than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>).

It is possible that some of these cells may be classic CD8<sup>+</sup>, but the role of other CD3<sup>+</sup> populations, such as NKT cells and mucosal-associated invariant T cells, cannot be ruled out.

Thus, high IDO activity has been correlated with pathogen burden and sepsis during infection (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), especially with intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Here, inhibition of IDO activity by a potent yet safe inhibitor in macaques led to a slightly better control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication, and somewhat reduced pathology and disease severity, accompanied by increased proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> memory and effector populations, and the inhibition of lung marker T cell exhaustion and dysfunction. This was associated with reorganization of the granulomata, with T cells otherwise present in the peripheral region of lesions being able to gain greater access to the core region.</p><p>It has recently been shown that mycobacterial infection results in the reprogramming of macrophages in the granuloma to a flattened, epithelial phenotype (<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). This results in macrophage interdigitation and tighter granulomas. Inhibition of canonical epithelial pathways in the zebrafish model of <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection resulted in the dysregulation of the granuloma, along with immune cell access to the lesion core, and reduced bacillary burdens (<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). These results, taken together with our study, suggest that the ability of pathogenic mycobacteria to replicate within host lungs is intricately linked to lesion organization, and disruption of this process represents an attractive future strategy for the control of TB.</p><p>Our results have implications both for the fundamental understanding of why granulomas are unable to achieve their full potential during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection and for providing clues to likely targets of productive HDT against TB, including IDO. These results suggest that the complex and highly ordered architecture of the primate (and human) lung tuberculoma may in fact be beneficial to the pathogen by preventing contact between T cells and pathogen-containing APCs. It may, however, be possible to alter granuloma architecture by inhibiting IDO signaling, and thereby allowing T cells access to the lesion core while also fostering the development of the follicular organization of B cell-containing iBALT. Such lesions appeared to overcome checkpoint inhibition and T cell dysfunction, greatly promoting bacterial killing.</p><p>Inhibition of IDO signaling in vivo, as well as in vitro, enhanced the expression of the type I IFNs, although the expression of all type I downstream genes (e.g., IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and so forth) was not induced. These results are not surprising, given that IDO can be induced by both IFN-&#x003b3; as well as type I IFN. This regulation of IDO by type I vs. type II interferons is context- and cell-type&#x02013;dependent (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). It appears that type I IFN plays a major role in triggering IDO expression in primate alveolar macrophages in the context of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, and therefore, inhibition of IDO enzymatic activity likely causes induction of type I IFN gene expression via feedback (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Whereas type I IFN is an important antiviral mechanism (<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), its induction correlates with increased lung pathology and exacerbated disease upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). As such, approaches targeting type I IFN signaling have been successfully attempted in experimental models of TB (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Our data suggest that the concurrent silencing of IDO signaling and type I IFN signaling could lead to a more profound control of TB in macaque (and human) lungs. Furthermore, testing the potential of such HDT alone, as well as concurrently with anti-TB chemotherapy, could pave the way for future clinical applications. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at eliminating or reducing the levels of cells with IDO induction following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the lung, may also result in reduction of TB. Finally, we have not discussed as part of this report the conundrum that IDO expression on nonhematopoetic cells following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection may indeed have a protective effect for the host, as has been shown in the murine model (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Moreover, several novel IDO inhibitors are being generated (e.g., Indoximod), and it may be possible in future studies to test if they are preclinically superior to D-1MT in suppressing IDO activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s11"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>In Vivo.</title><p>Ten rhesus macaques were infected with a high dose of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CDC1551 (&#x0223c;200 CFU) via the aerosol route, as described previously (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
