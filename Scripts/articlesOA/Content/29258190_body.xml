<sec id="sec1-ijms-18-02725"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis remains a major global health threat to both human and animal populations. The disease is caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC), a group of highly related intracellular pathogens, and is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide [<xref rid="B1-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Current estimations show that one-third of the world&#x02019;s population is latently infected with Mtb. However, only 5&#x02013;10% of infected people develop active tuberculosis (TB) in their lifetime [<xref rid="B2-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is the leading infectious cause of deaths, exceeding HIV/AID, and resulted in approximately 1.3 million human deaths in 2016 [<xref rid="B3-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Host innate immune response is one of the most important determinants in the outcome of Mtb infection. The possible outcomes of an infection by a pathogen depend upon a complex interplay between virulence factors produced by the invading microbe and the immune responses mounted by the host defense system. These immune responses are characterized by an upregulation of many cytokines, chemokines, and products having direct or indirect antimicrobial activity [<xref rid="B4-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, many pathogens, for their survival, have evolved strategies to suppress and misdirect their host&#x02019;s immune responses [<xref rid="B6-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this regard, Mtb has evolved multiple mechanisms for eluding or suppressing the host cell immune response and thus has become a successful intracellular pathogen.</p><p>Several cytokines have been shown to participate in the innate host response against Mtb, where they function either to enhance host resistance or aggravate the infection [<xref rid="B11-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The critical role of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; has been demonstrated in the control of Mtb activity because the cytokines increase the antimicrobial function of macrophages [<xref rid="B12-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, IFN-&#x003b2;, an important cytokine, has been reported to have pro-bacterial activity and in many studies with animal models and humans has been associated with the development of TB [<xref rid="B13-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interferons (IFNs) have three major types: type I, II, and III. IFN-&#x003b2; is a member of type I IFN, a family of structurally related cytokines in humans and mice that includes several IFN-&#x003b1; (represented by several partially homologous genes) and one IFN-&#x003b2; (represented by a single gene) [<xref rid="B17-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

In general, type I IFN signals through type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), which consists of two subunits: IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFN receptor 2 (IFNAR2) [<xref rid="B31-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. IFNAR depends on Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) to phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2) [<xref rid="B32-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 then lead to the formation of the transcriptional complex IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) complex that translocates into the nucleus to induce gene expression [<xref rid="B33-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

These transcription factor functions are regulated by interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) and arginine methylation of STAT1 [<xref rid="B36-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, negative regulatory factors limiting type I IFN-mediated signaling include suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN6), and ubiquitin-specific peptidase (UBP) [<xref rid="B39-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Induction and regulation of IFN-&#x003b2; in Mtb infection is complex and has been vastly studied in recent years. In contrast to the established protective role of IFN-&#x003b2; in anti-viral immunity, it has been demonstrated that Mtb has evolved certain mechanisms to use IFN-&#x003b2; to enhance its intracellular survival [<xref rid="B8-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that this pro-bacterial activity of IFN-&#x003b2; is correlated with its anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B13-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This is because IFN-&#x003b2; antagonizes the production and function of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 through increased IL-10 production and inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref rid="B45-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This reduced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion is correlated with increased host susceptibility in Mtb infection [<xref rid="B46-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b2; may also indirectly suppress the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via induction of interleukin 27 (IL-27) [<xref rid="B48-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similarly, type I IFN production was associated with reduced secretion of IL-12 and TNF&#x003b1; in both <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection models [<xref rid="B50-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, IL-1 inhibition by type I IFNs can impair host resistance in TB [<xref rid="B51-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b2; fails to initiate appropriate Th1 response with reduced expression of the MHC-II and IFNGR [<xref rid="B53-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The general role of type I IFN as an immune regulator has been previously reviewed [<xref rid="B54-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], so this review will focus on the detailed interplay between IFN-&#x003b2; and Mtb infection, including induction and regulation of IFN-&#x003b2; and its role in the fate of infection. Indeed, recent developments suggest that IFN-&#x003b2; plays a role in Mtb survival in host cells and is detrimental to host immunity. Therefore, its downregulation in Mtb infection may be a useful therapeutic approach for better control and treatment of TB.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-18-02725"><title>2. Induction and Regulation of interferon-&#x003b2; (IFN-&#x003b2;) in Tuberculosis</title><p>Induction of IFN-&#x003b2; by Mtb and other members of the MTBC group is an important step for activation of innate immunity. This process is mediated by the activation of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and cytosolic receptors such as retinoid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) [<xref rid="B55-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Infection of various human and mice cell types with Mtb activates interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) like IRF-3, IRF-5, and nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), and leads to the expression of IFN-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="B58-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b2; induction is mainly controlled at the level of gene transcription wherein a family of transcription factors and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play a central role [<xref rid="B62-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Several studies on IRFs have provided new paradigms of how genes are ingeniously regulated during immune responses [<xref rid="B59-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>A comparison of gene expression profiles in mouse macrophages infected with virulent mycobacterial strains versus an avirulent mutant with an inactive early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) system 1 (ESX-1) revealed the selective induction of IFN-&#x003b2;-associated genes by virulent, but not the avirulent, bacteria [<xref rid="B64-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This virulence-associated IFN-&#x003b2; response was found to be independent of the TLR adaptor TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-&#x003b2; (TRIF) and the receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP-2) but required Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a kinase also necessary for IFN-&#x003b2; induction by invading viruses and bacteria [<xref rid="B15-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While partly confirming the above results, another report disagreed [<xref rid="B65-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and described that N-acetyl muramyl dipeptide 1 (Nod1), Nod2, and RIP-2 are required for IFN-&#x003b2; induction by virulent mycobacterial strains. The authors suggested that the role of ESX-1 in virulence determination is to facilitate bacterial Nod ligands getting in close contact with these host cytoplasmic receptors. It is tempting to assume that Mtb has evolved some mechanisms to use its own chromosomal DNA to provoke IFN-&#x003b2; response, as these cytokines are not only produced during in vivo infections [<xref rid="B66-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] but also in active human disease [<xref rid="B13-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Wassermann et al. [<xref rid="B67-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] demonstrated that cyclic GMP&#x02013;AMP synthase (cGAS) is an innate mycobacterial DNA sensor and have also provided some insight into how ESX-1 controls the activation of specific intracellular recognition pathways that lead to IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-1&#x003b2; production. Many other studies [<xref rid="B68-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] have reported that cGAS is required for activating IFN-&#x003b2; production via the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/TBK1/IRF3 pathway during Mtb and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> infection of macrophages. Upon sensing cytosolic DNA, cGAS also activates cell-intrinsic antibacterial defenses, leading to an increased autophagic response against Mtb. Other researchers [<xref rid="B15-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B70-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] have also reported that IFN-&#x003b2; response against Mtb requires ESX-1 activation, which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>Previous investigations have shown indirect evidence implicating cytosolic mycobacterial DNA in triggering these IFN-&#x003b2; inducing pathways [<xref rid="B67-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B70-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, in a very recent study, Wiens et al. [<xref rid="B71-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] described the role of mitochondrial dynamics and reported that host mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), not mycobacterial DNA, contributes to IFN-&#x003b2; induction. Different strains of MTBC differentially induced IFN-&#x003b2;, though the strains did not differ in their access to the host cytosol and IFN-&#x003b2; induction by each strain required simultaneous stimulation of STING and cGAS. Treating macrophages with a mitochondria-specific antioxidant resulted in a reduced level of cytosolic mtDNA and inhibition of IFN-&#x003b2; induction by some strains. Furthermore, the variation in the role of mtDNA in IFN-&#x003b2; induction by different MTBC strains suggest that some additional mechanisms are also responsible for IFN-&#x003b2; signaling in Mtb infection. In addition, we have unveiled that another DNA sensor of interferon-inducible protein 204 (IFI204) plays an important role in IFN-&#x003b2; release in macrophages exposed to <italic>M. bovis</italic> [<xref rid="B72-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Besides this, some studies [<xref rid="B68-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B73-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] support a model in which Mtb triggers the STING/TBK1 pathway using the ESX-1 production system to interrupt phagosomal membranes and thereby allowing bacterial DNA access to cGAS in the cytosol. These results reveal that the mechanism of IFN-&#x003b2; induction in mycobacterial infection is more complex than the already established models suggest. Although the in vivo situation is certainly much more complex and the possible role of additional DNA sensors (which may work in close coordination with cGAS to activate the innate immune response) still remains unclear, it is believed that cGAS is a major player in the IFN-&#x003b2; signature associated with active TB [<xref rid="B13-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-18-02725"><title>3. IFN-&#x003b2; Regulating Signaling Pathways</title><sec id="sec3dot1-ijms-18-02725"><title>3.1. IRF3 Pathway</title><p>The induction of type I IFN is controlled mainly at the transcriptional level, wherein a group of transcription factors known as interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) plays a pivotal role. Studies on most of the genes that encode IRFs have shown that IRFs have distinctive roles in the maturation and function of immune cells [<xref rid="B62-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B74-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This IRF family of transcription factors comprises nine members, named consecutively from IRF1 to IRF9 [<xref rid="B75-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Out of these nine IRF members, IRF3 and IRF7, which are structurally highly homologous, have gained much more attention as key regulators of type I IFN gene expression. It has been previously reported that IRF3 is a transcriptional factor responsible for stimulation of the IFN-&#x003b2; gene. IRF3 resides and is constitutively expressed in its inactive form. It undergoes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation upon viral and bacterial infection [<xref rid="B77-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Although IRF7 also forms a homodimer or a heterodimer with IRF3 and acts on type I <italic>IFN</italic> gene family members, IRF3 is more potent in mediating the <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene, whereas IRF7 activates type I <italic>IFN</italic> genes [<xref rid="B79-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>The requirement of IRF3 and IRF7 transcription for IFN-&#x003b2; induction has been widely studied [<xref rid="B81-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In early studies, IRF3 was reported to be responsible for the initiation of <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene induction by signals that induce the cooperative binding of IRF3 with other transcription factors; namely NF-&#x003ba;B and c-Jun/ATF-2 to the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter. This theory is supported by several lines of evidence [<xref rid="B83-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].

These results suggest that type I <italic>IFN</italic> gene induction occurs sequentially, wherein the initial IFN-&#x003b2; induction by IRF3 mediates the positive-feedback regulation of the gene induction mediated by the IFN-inducible IRF7 that can activate type I <italic>IFN</italic> genes. Unlike IRF3, IRF7 is downregulated in most cell types but it is strongly mediated by type I IFN signaling [<xref rid="B80-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Stockinger et al. [<xref rid="B85-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] reported that the cytosolic recognition of bacterial DNA results in IFN-&#x003b2; gene activation through the TBK1&#x02013;IRF3 pathway, as proved by the absence of IFN-&#x003b2; induction in macrophages from TBK1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or IRF3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice. In another study, it was shown that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> extracts that were pretreated with DNAase had an impaired ability to induce IFN-&#x003b2;, indicating an important role of cytosolic bacterial DNA in <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene induction [<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the transfection of cells with dsDNA derived from either a pathogen or a host has been reported to induce type I IFN genes as well as many IFN-inducible genes via a TLR-independent mechanism [<xref rid="B86-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="B87-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].

These kinases become phosphorylated and lead to activation of IRF3 and IRF7, which are critical for the induction of type I IFN [<xref rid="B100-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. IRF3 is constitutively expressed and plays a role in IFN-&#x003b2; expression following activation-induced dimer formation, while IRF7 expression is mediated through IFN feed-forward signaling and it is crucial for type I IFN expression [<xref rid="B79-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>The promoter of IFN-&#x003b2; contains NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites and two ISREs recognized by phosphorylated IRF3/7 [<xref rid="B102-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].

It was demonstrated that activation of IP10 (interferon-inducible protein-10), but not the MCP-1 promoter, both of which contain NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites differing in one and two nucleotides, requires IRF3 as a co-activator following LPS stimulation [<xref rid="B105-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This suggests that the binding site sequence composition has an influence on the type of cooperative proteins that are recruited to complex with the NF-&#x003ba;B dimer. More recently, it has also been shown that glucocorticoid receptors can selectively trans-repress the transcription of a subset of genes (such as <italic>Scyb9</italic>) with promoters that use IRF3 as an essential co-activator of NF-&#x003ba;B binding upon LPS stimulation [<xref rid="B106-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Besides these signaling pathways, an autocrine/paracrine feedback loop is also present, augmenting the induction of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02725-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This feedback loop is instigated by type I IFNs and leads to ISGF3 complex formation.

Dorhoi et al.

OASL knockdown was associated with decreased viability of <italic>M. leprae</italic> occurring in parallel to upregulation of either antimicrobial peptide expression or autophagy levels. <italic>M. leprae</italic>-mediated OASL expression was dependent on cytosolic DNA sensing mediated by STING.

Bouchonnet et al. [<xref rid="B119-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] evaluated the effects of type I IFN on mycobacterial growth in human macrophages in vitro. They reported that type I IFN impairs the ability of human macrophages to control the growth of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. Exogenous type I IFN resulted in increased mycobacterial growth because type I IFN has direct pleiotropic effects on the differentiation and functional activities of macrophages. These results indicate that type I IFN could directly stimulate mycobacterial growth in patients harboring these organisms. In another study, Auerbuch et al. [<xref rid="B50-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that mice lacking IFNAR1 are resistant to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> as compared to wild-type mice. Mariotti et al.

They reported that in the presence of type I IFN, Mtb might impede the renewal of potent antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs, generating a safe habitat for intracellular growth. The study further suggested that Mtb has the ability to interfere specifically with monocyte differentiation. This ability may represent an effective Mtb strategy for eluding immune surveillance and persisting in the host.</p><p>Taken together, the reports mentioned above show that, in contrast to the critical role played by IFN-&#x003b2; in anti-viral immune response, its induction during mycobacterial infection seems to be detrimental to the host by eluding and directing the host immune response towards a niche that permits and facilitates the intracellular survival of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02725-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This pro-bacterial activity of IFN-&#x003b2; is related to its anti-inflammatory properties, not only because it antagonizes IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02019;s production and function but also, in part, due to its failure to elicit a proper Th1 response and expression of MHC-II and interferon-&#x003b3; receptors (IFNGRs) [<xref rid="B121-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,<xref rid="B122-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The pathways for regulating IFN-&#x003b2; in mycobacterial infection and the mechanism(s) by which it suppresses host resistance are currently active areas of investigation in the field of innate immunity.</p><p>Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated that type I IFNs can have an immunosuppressive role in the chronic phase of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. leprae</italic> in mice and humans [<xref rid="B11-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B126-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>].

It has been suggested that the expression of these immunologically important genes in Mtb-infected macrophages is independent of both TLR2 and TLR4, but it is dependent on IFNAR and STAT1 [<xref rid="B128-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Results presented in another study indicate that production of host-protective cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), IL-12, and IL-1&#x003b2; is inhibited by exogenous type I IFN, whereas production of immunosuppressive IL-10 is promoted in an IL-27&#x02013;independent manner [<xref rid="B129-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Furthermore, much of the ability of type I IFN to inhibit cytokine production is mediated by IL-10, corroborating the idea that these IFNs inhibit the immune response during tuberculosis.

Drug-treated Mtb&#x02013;infected wild-type (WT) mice, but not mice lacking IFNAR1, displayed marked elevations in lung bacillary loads, accompanied by widespread pulmonary necrosis without detectable impairment of Th1 effector function. The above findings suggest that poly-ICLC treatment detrimentally affects the outcome of Mtb infection by promoting the accumulation of a permissive myeloid population in the lung.</p><p>Nevertheless, activation of mycobacterial infection is not a recognized adverse effect associated with the therapeutic use of recombinant type I IFN. As reported in earlier studies, administration of aerosolized IFN-&#x003b1; to patients receiving antimicrobial treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis led to a more rapid decrease in the number of bacilli identified in sputum and earlier resolution of fever and some radiographic abnormalities [<xref rid="B130-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>,<xref rid="B131-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. These immune-modulatory roles of IFN-&#x003b1; may be responsible for this salutary effect.

The extent to which an increase in type I IFN production influences mycobacterial replication in vivo still requires further investigations.

IFN-&#x003b2; signaling via the STAT1 transcription factor repressed the activity of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes, hence suppressing caspase-1-dependent IL-1&#x003b2; maturation. In addition, IFN-&#x003b2; induced IL-10 in a STAT1-dependent manner, and then IL-10 via autocrine action led to reduced production of pro-IL-1&#x003b1; and pro-IL-1&#x003b2; through STAT3 signaling. Mayer-Barber et al. [<xref rid="B47-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported that IFN-&#x003b2; inhibited IL-1 production by both subsets, while CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed IL-1 expression selectively in inflammatory monocytes.

In another report by the same author [<xref rid="B52-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], it was revealed that IL-1/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is another important pathway by which IFN-&#x003b2; antagonizes IL-1 production during mycobacterial infection. The absence of IFN-&#x003b2; signaling resulted in increased PGE2 and IL-1&#x003b2; and decreased IL1Ra. Mtb-infected wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) produced significantly less PGE2 when exogenous IFN-&#x003b2; was present. Novikov et al.

This regulation occurs at the level of IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression, rather than caspase-1 activation or autocrine IL-1 amplification, and this regulation is only evident with the virulent mycobacterial strains, as avirulent strains fail to trigger the same response. Reciprocal control of type I IFNs by the IL-1/PGE2-mediated pathway has also been reported, and PGE2 treatment led to reduced production of type I IFNs and increased protection against Mtb infection [<xref rid="B28-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

These results support a previous study [<xref rid="B53-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] in which it was also demonstrated that type I IFNs increase host susceptibility to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> whereas IFN-&#x003b3; activates macrophages to resist the infection. The studies described that these opposing immunological effects of type I IFNs and IFN-&#x003b3; occur because of cross-talk between the respective signaling pathways. Such cross-talk leads to dominance of type I IFN immune responses and may play a role in the beneficial effects of IFN-&#x003b3; treatment against inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-ijms-18-02725"><title>4.4. Role of Type I IFNs in Mycobacterial and HIV Co-Infection</title><p>It has been established that viral infections are potent stimuli for the production of type I IFNs [<xref rid="B148-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>,<xref rid="B149-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Some studies have proposed the idea that increased type I IFN production mediated by certain viral infections could contribute to the increased susceptibility of patients to TB. An increased growth rate of Mtb in HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected macrophages has been demonstrated, although the mechanism by which viral-induced type I IFNs led to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis has not been explored [<xref rid="B150-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. On the other hand, transcription from the long terminal repeat of HIV-1 is highly increased in macrophages from convalescent HIV-1-infected individuals with active mycobacterial infections, resulting in increased viral replication [<xref rid="B151-ijms-18-02725" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Thus, in the human population having combined infections with both pathogens, a malevolent cycle might be established that is beneficial for the replication of both mycobacteria and HIV-1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-ijms-18-02725"><title>5. Conclusions and Future Prospects</title><p>Tuberculosis is the second major cause of morbidity and mortality, after HIV, in the human population worldwide. Infection with Mtb leads to a complex host&#x02013;pathogen interaction involving up- and downregulation of many inflammatory and immune-regulatory cytokines. IFN-&#x003b2; is one of the most important cytokines and the mechanism for its induction and function in mycobacterial infection is complex. Although some other factors remain undiscovered, it is believed that cGAS, an innate sensor of mycobacterial infection, is a major player contributing to the IFN-&#x003b2; signature associated with active disease in humans. The immune-suppressive and pro-bacterial roles of IFN-&#x003b2; are revealed by its ability to downregulate IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18, and upregulate IL-10. IL-1&#x003b2; has a protective role against virulent mycobacterial strains and it is downregulated through distinct pathways. IFN-&#x003b2; signaling, via the STAT1 transcription factor, represses the activity of the NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes, leading to the suppression of caspase-1-dependent IL-1&#x003b2; maturation. In addition, IFN-&#x003b2; promotes IL-10 induction and inhibits IFN-&#x003b3;- and IL-12-mediated anti-bacterial activity of immune modulating cells. The reciprocal inhibition of IFN-&#x003b2; is mediated through the IL-1&#x02013;PGE2 pathway. AIM2-inflammasome signaling during infection by virulent and avirulent mycobacteria and its interaction with IFN-&#x003b2; has been reported, but the findings are not in accord with each other. Therefore, the interaction of the ESX-1 secretion system, IFN-&#x003b2;, and the AIM2 inflammasome in Mtb infection remains an important question for future investigations.</p><p>It can be concluded that in contrast to the pivotal role played by IFN-&#x003b2; in anti-viral immune response, its induction during mycobacterial infection seems to be injurious to the host. The above findings implicate IFN-&#x003b2; as a downregulator of protective immune responses in mycobacterial infection. Furthermore, recognition of the multiple points of innate immune regulation, including the cGAS&#x02013;STING&#x02013;TBK1&#x02013;IRF3&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b2;, NLRP3/AIM2/IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-1&#x003b2;/PGE2/IFN-&#x003b2; pathways, provides potential therapeutic targets. We expect that the information presented in this review about the induction and regulation of IFN-&#x003b2;, and its subsequent role in immune modulation in mycobacterial infection, will be helpful for better understanding host&#x02013;pathogen interactions in TB. Furthermore, it will also help in the design of future strategies to confine the intracellular activities of this deadly pathogen for better control and treatment of the disease.</p></sec>
