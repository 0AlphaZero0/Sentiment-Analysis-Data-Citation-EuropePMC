<sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>T<sc>here are an estimated</sc> 17,000 new traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) each year in the United States and approximately 353,000 Americans living with SCI.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Despite advances in acute and chronic care, the life expectancy for individuals with SCI is significantly below that of able-bodied individuals.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Infections are the leading cause of death for persons with SCI, who are more than 80 times more likely to die of sepsis than able-bodied individuals.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Infections (genitourinary or respiratory) are also the leading cause of rehospitalization post-SCI.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The molecular basis for infection susceptibility in persons with SCI is incompletely understood. Increasing evidence also supports a link between increased infection susceptibility and poor outcome in persons with SCI. Infections (pneumonia and post-operative wound) were identified as the first independent risk factor for poor neurological outcome post-SCI, particularly in persons with injuries rostral to thoracic level 5 (T5), the spinal level where sympathetic nervous system (SNS) fibers exit the spinal cord and innervate organs of the immune system.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;14</xref></sup> This is particularly important in light of the fact that most injuries occur rostral to the level of T5.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Another immunological alteration post-SCI is systemic inflammation, which has been observed in both pre-clinical and clinical studies.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Kwon and others have demonstrated elevated systemic inflammatory mediators in persons with acute SCI, where some appear to correlate with injury severity and/or neurological recovery.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;21</xref></sup> We and others have identified elevated systemic inflammatory proteins in persons with chronic SCI.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;26</xref></sup> Given that inflammatory mediators promote many common medical conditions in able-bodied persons, (including insulin resistance, accelerated atherogenesis, neuropathic pain, and metabolic syndrome), it is reasonable to postulate that inflammation plays a role in these comorbid conditions in persons with SCI as well.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;31</xref></sup></p><p>Other immune system alterations have been observed in persons with chronic SCI, particularly in natural killer (NK) cells, which are innate immune cells that play a critical role in killing infected cells and tumor cells, as well as secreting cytokines that modulate other immune cell subsets. NK cells are particularly responsive to aerobic exercise, which triggers their mobilization from the spleen into the circulation.<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In 1994, Nash showed that in comparison to able-bodied persons (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), blood-derived CD3-CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells were reduced in number and in cytotoxicity in persons with chronic quadriplegia and that both could be improved by 30&#x02009;min of aerobic exercise (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8).<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Campagnolo and colleagues showed that the total white blood cell count was comparable in persons with chronic quadriplegia and able-bodied persons (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, 5), but the percentage of lymphocytes (but not monocytes or granulocytes) was elevated and the percentage of NK cells was reduced.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In a subsequent larger study of persons with chronic SCI at levels rostral to (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26), caudal to (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) T5, and able-bodied persons (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34), there were no differences in numbers of total white blood cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, basophils, or eosinophils, but there was a decrease in the percentage of NK cells and an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> A few other studies with small group sizes have also provided evidence of reduced NK cytotoxicity and reduced NK cell numbers in persons with SCI, although the relationship of these findings to injury level or severity has been inconsistent, likely attributed to heterogeneous and small sample sizes.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the direct clinical relevance of understanding the molecular basis for alterations in the immune system of persons with chronic SCI, we are aware of only one previous study investigating gene expression in immune cells of persons with chronic SCI.

RNA quality and quantity was measured using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA was amplified using the Illumina RNA Total Prep Amplification Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed on the HT-12v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which contained 47,323 probe sets. Raw data were background subtracted and quantile normalized in Genome Studio (Illumina), and missing bead values were imputed, with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm used by Genome Studio. There were 34,694 unique gene symbols, and expression data were averaged over multiple probe sets for the same gene symbol. Data exported from Genome Studio was log<sub>2</sub> transformed for analysis in Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). In Genomics Suite, genes that failed to have a transformed maximum value &#x02265;5 in any sample were filtered from the dataset, resulting in 11,261 genes analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in Partek Genomics Suite to examine overall variation in gene expression profiles using default settings in two dimensions (first two components). In the SCI group, we used repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; Partek Genomics Suite) to determine that overall, visit 1 and visit 2 gene expression profiles did not differ significantly from each other (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s005">Results</xref>).

When gene expression profiles of participants were compared by injury level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), this bifurcation was essentially preserved.

As mentioned earlier, 74% of participants in this study were injured rostral to T5 and 52% were AIS A, so we did not have a sufficient number of participants to observe significant differences in gene expression between subgroups of SCI participants by injury level or severity, after correcting for multiple hypotheses. We therefore compared gene expression of SCI with uninjured participants. Participants with SCI at higher levels (rostral to T5) had the greatest number of differentially expressed genes compared to uninjured participants, of which 1021 were upregulated and 1205 were downregulated (Benjamini and Hochberg adjusted FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) (see online supplementary material at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.liebertpub.com">http://www.liebertpub.com</uri>).

These characteristics reflect the national data for people living with SCI.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> We found clear evidence that whole-blood gene expression is broadly changed in persons living with SCI, which we presume to be the result of changes in expression by more than one cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). Compared to uninjured persons, the greatest number of differentially expressed genes was in persons with SCI at levels rostral to T5, where SNS outflow from the spinal cord to immune and other organs would most likely be altered, which was also the largest subgroup of participants with SCI in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). As mentioned earlier, we did not observe dramatically different gene expression profiles by AIS grade, but this is likely because of the smaller number of participants in AIS B (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), C (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), and D (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) subgroups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) (see online supplementary material at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.liebertpub.com">http://www.liebertpub.com</uri>). In the comparison of uninjured participants and participants with SCI at levels rostral to T5, most of the differentially expressed genes were downregulated, with enrichment among NK-cell&#x02013;related genes. These data support the importance of revisiting the functionality of NK cells in individuals with chronic SCI and their potential relevance to increased infection susceptibility, given that three previous studies have shown decreased percentages of NK cells, with reduced NK cell cytotoxicity in two of three studies.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref></sup> Using computational methods, we did not estimate reduced number of NK cells in persons with SCI rostral to T5 as observed by Nash and Campagnolo, but CBC or flow cytometry are more direct measurements of this and we will incorporate these methods in future studies. Alternatively, differences between the past human NK cell studies and the data presented here may derive from heterogeneity among the participants within the relatively small numbers of subjects. Although there have since been several studies with mixed results exploring changes in NK cells after exercise in persons with SCI, there are few mechanistic studies of NK cells in animal models of SCI.<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In athymic nude rats, which do not have T lymphocytes, NK cell markers were elevated intraspinally at 8 weeks post-injury, whereas motor recovery was only improved at 1 week post-injury, compared to Sprague-Dawley rats.<sup><xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup></p><p>Inflammation related modules were highly upregulated. Although participants with clinically significant infections were excluded from this study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s002">Methods</xref>), the directionality of gene modules that were significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) reflects data similar to able-bodied individuals with infections, likely reflecting an increased inflammatory response.<sup><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> We also noted elevations in mitochondrial stress, which has been linked to inflammation in other populations, such as patients with early-stage heart disease, where decreased mitochondrial respiration correlated with TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and CRP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).<sup><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>The enrichment in TLR signaling revealed by pathway analyses in the upregulated differentially expressed genes in persons with SCI at levels rostral to T5 is also consistent with elevated inflammation. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors expressed by immune cells, where their activation triggers activation of transcription factors like NF-kB and AP-1, which, in turn, promotes production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and costimulatory molecules.<sup><xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Whereas most widely studied in monocytes and other antigen presenting cells, different immune cell types express different combinations of TLRs, both constitutively and after stimulation with TLR ligands.<sup><xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Human blood NK (CD3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup>) cells express multiple TLRs (TLR1&#x02013;9), but currently there is disagreement over the expression (protein and mRNA) and subcellular localization (surface or intracellular) of individual TLRs within NK cell subsets in whole-blood or cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> in na&#x000ef;ve or stimulated conditions.<sup><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Several studies have demonstrated that in response to exposure to TLR ligands, NK cells cultured with IL-15/-18 produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-gamma.<sup><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> NK cells from blood of sepsis patients that were cultured with IL-15/-18 had reduced production of IFN-gamma compared to NK cells isolated from healthy controls.<sup><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Because here we present data of elevated IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma receptor expression in whole-blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>), future studies of gene expression in purified individual cell types are needed to address the cellular source(s) of IFN-gamma in persons with chronic SCI.</p><p>Studies of systemic inflammation in animal models of general trauma showed that TLR decreased responses of spleen cells depended on TLR4 and TLR9, whereas TLR2 contributed to decreased spleen cell proliferation.<sup><xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Intraspinal TLR4 levels are elevated in a rat model of spinal cord ischemia, and TLR4 signaling promotes blood&#x02013;brain barrier leakage.<sup><xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Previous SCI studies in animal models of SCI have considered TLRs for their role in activating acute intraspinal inflammation, with complex results indicating that studies examining different TLRs in specific cell types at multiple time points post-injury may be needed.<sup><xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> In a mouse thoracic contusion model of SCI, intraspinal mRNA for TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 were upregulated, but mice lacking TLR2 or 4 had greater loss of myelin, more astrogliosis, and less functional recovery than wild-type mice.<sup><xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> In a mouse model of SCI, activation of TLR2 through a sterile agonist 1&#x02009;h post-SCI led to a neuroprotective microglia/macrophage phenotype and genetic ablation of TLR2 led to enhanced axonal damage post-SCI.<sup><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> TLR4 plays a positive role in myelination post-SCI, because it was required for acute oligodendrocyte genesis in na&#x000ef;ve mice, whereas mice lacking TLR4 after thoracic contusion SCI had decreased myelin sparing and functional recovery.<sup><xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Intraspinal injection of the TLR4 ligand, HMGB1, into the low thoracic region of mice resulted in activation of macrophages/microglia and elicited neuroinflammation, whereas exposure to extracellular HMGB1 reduced DRG neurite outgrowth <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> In a rat thoracic contusion model of SCI, levels of the protein, HMGB1, an endogenous ligand of TLR4, were elevated in spinal cord explants or tissue acutely and even at 8 weeks post-SCI, where it regulates IL-1 expression.<sup><xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> We recently demonstrated elevated levels of protein in serum of persons with acute or chronic SCI.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> HMGB1 has been less well studied at the transcriptional level, but recent studies have shown that its transcription is increased in the spinal cord of mice after thoracic contusion injury.<sup><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> HMGB1 transcription is also elevated in PBMCs from patients with sepsis and that its transcription is negatively regulated by PPARg.<sup><xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> Along with elevated levels of HMGB1 protein, the broad transcriptional activation of the TLR pathway here provides evidence that TLR signaling may be an important mechanism by which chronic inflammation is sustained in persons living with SCI. TLRs are being actively explored as therapeutic targets in cancer, allergy, infectious disease, vaccination, and autoimmune diseases, and there are several TLR directed agents in early phase clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> In able-bodied populations, exercise downregulates TLR levels on immune cells.<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Given that breaches in the blood&#x02013;spinal cord barrier have been shown after infections or stress, whereby neurotoxic inflammatory cells and molecules can access the central nervous system, there is likely to be an impact of elevated systemic inflammation within the injured spinal cord tissue, as well as in the periphery, in persons living with SCI.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> These data therefore open the possibility of a new direction to explore therapeutic options to control inflammation in persons with SCI.</p><p>There are many aspects of this study that require improvement. Age may be a confounding factor in this data set, because although the participants were matched for age at the group level, there were more participants &#x0003e;65 years in the SCI than in the uninjured group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7, 1 respectively), and circulating levels of cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10) have been shown to rise with age.<sup><xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> Another limitation of this pilot is that we cannot distinguish between lower gene expression in NK cells and a smaller number or percentage of NK cells in persons with SCI, as has been seen previously.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref></sup> In this study of persons with chronic SCI, limited clinical data were available on events that occurred at the time of initial injury, so it is also possible that changes induced are not attributable to SCI, but to other injuries sustained at that time. Nationally, more than one third of patients with traumatic SCI experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the time of injury.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> TBI can also cause systemic immune alterations, including increased susceptibility to pneumonia and systemic inflammation, which may be sustained into the chronic phase.<sup><xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70&#x02013;72</xref></sup> In this study, none of the participants had clinically significant cognitive deficits at the time of participation. However, we did not ask participants directly about other injuries or concomitant TBI at their initial injury. For 20 of 31 participants with SCI for whom office notes were available from the acute or chronic phases, no TBI was noted. Going forward, there is also a need to collect prospective data not only on acute events, but also on body composition and physical activity level, given that metabolic syndrome is common in persons with SCI and may increase inflammatory signaling and decrease NK cell activity, independent of injury level.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Therefore, the data presented here will be used to design a better and appropriately powered study to replicate and extend these findings by RNA sequencing, to test the injury-level dependence of changes in gene expression, and to examine gene expression changes in specific immune cell subsets. Despite its limitations, this is the largest study of transcriptional changes in persons with chronic SCI, and it provides clear mechanistic links to the immune challenges often observed clinically in persons living with SCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="Supp_Table1.zip" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1253" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec>
