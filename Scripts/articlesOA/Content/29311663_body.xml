<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The type I interferon (IFN) family consists of ~20 different members including multiple IFN-&#x003b1; subtypes and IFN-&#x003b2;. The signaling complex utilized by type I IFNs comprise IFN alpha and beta receptor subunit 1 and 2 (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Ligand engagement of the extracellular domains of the receptor complex induces the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules, which subsequently activate a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISG). Structurally, IFNAR1 is unique amongst the class II helical cytokine receptors as its extracellular domain is comprised of a four-domain architecture, referred to as subdomains (SD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although the minimal ligand-binding region is localized to the membrane-distal portion (SD1-SD3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the membrane-proximal domain (SD4) is required to undergo a conformational change necessary for signal transduction across the cell membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Similar to many class II helical cytokine receptors, IFNAR1 has paired proline residues in hinge regions between individual extracellular domains. Paired proline residues located in such non-helical linker regions are hypothesized to increase local structural rigidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Type I IFNs are established as important in anti-viral immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>; however, these cytokines also impair immune responses to various pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

In contrast to animal studies, evidence that IFNAR1 signaling contributes to TB disease susceptibility in humans is unclear, although several clinical studies have linked the blood interferon signature to detrimental clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Here we show that a rare <italic>IFNAR1</italic> genotype is associated with decreased risk of TB in Chinese populations and the mutation decreases the magnitude of IFN-&#x003b2;-mediated ISG induction in cells from individuals heterozygous for the SNP. We further demonstrate that the SNP decreases type I IFN signaling by reducing the overall binding affinity of IFN-&#x003b2; for IFNAR1. These findings suggest a host-detrimental function for type I IFN signaling in human TB. As we show that the mutation, which occurs at a non-cytokine binding region of IFNAR1, weakens the cytokine receptor interaction, our findings also suggest a function for the membrane-proximal domain in type I IFN binding and signaling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ISG induction is associated with active TB in Chinese population</title><p id="Par5">As an initial step in understanding the function of type I IFNs in human TB, we examined the expression of ISGs in the leukocytes of healthy controls (HC), latent TB infection (LTBI) subjects and TB patients.

In particular, immunity against intracellular bacteria is often compromised by type I IFNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, whether type I IFN-dependent regulatory mechanisms dictate the outcomes of bacterial infection in humans are unknown. In this study, we have combined genetic and biochemical approaches to elucidate type I IFN function in human TB. We identify that a genetic variant in the human <italic>IFNAR1</italic> gene (the deletion of nucleotides TCC) decreases type I IFN signaling and reduces the risk of active TB. Moreover, pulmonary TB patients carrying the TCC/Del genotype exhibit less severe tissue pathology in their lungs than their TCC/TCC counterparts. Finally, the same IFNAR1 mutation is associated with increased susceptibility to viral hepatitis, revealing a previously unknown divergent function of type I IFNs in bacterial and viral infection in humans.</p><p id="Par18">In both TB and leprosy, an IFN-inducible transcriptional signature presented in periphery leukocytes is associated strongly with detrimental clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Although the observation is indicative of an involvement of IFN signaling in mycobacterial diseases, it remains unclear whether the IFN signature is driven by type I, type II, or both types of IFNs, and whether the activation of an IFNAR1 signaling pathway exacerbates TB in humans. Addressing these questions in human studies has been challenging. In contrast to animal studies, where the function of any given gene is commonly established by analyzing genetically modified animals, contribution of individual genes to host resistance in a clinical setting is commonly defined by linking genetic variations to disease phenotype. Focusing on the role of IFNAR1 in human TB, we first identified <italic>IFNAR1</italic> SNP rs72552343 is associated with increased resistance to TB. Further analysis using mutagenesis, gene-editing, and transfection experiments allowed us to conclude that the rs72552343 associated TCC deletion decreased the cellular response to type I IFN stimulation thereby linking the disease-associating genotype to cytokine receptor signaling. These findings collectively provide evidence for a host-detrimental function for type I IFNs in human mycobacterial disease.</p><p id="Par19">Although identified on the basis of their anti-viral activity, type I IFNs are now known to play a broader role in host response to infection than originally anticipated. Our genetic association studies indicate that type I IFNs can have a different role in viral and bacterial infections in humans. Similar to mouse studies, the question remains as to how the same cytokine receptor signaling pathway leads to distinct disease outcomes in humans. As IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines, the downstream outcome of type I IFN signaling will depend on the type and location of the cells activated by the cytokines. It is also possible that the major function of type I IFNs in infection in vivo is directed at the host rather than the pathogen. Interestingly, our data suggest that type I IFN signaling is associated with more severe immunopathology in pulmonary TB. Discovery of additional genetic associations of IFNAR1 signaling components and susceptibility of TB and other infectious diseases in future studies will assist in validating the observations reported here and in dissecting the complex function of IFNs in humans. It is also worth noting that not all identified IFNAR1 SNPs associated with viral susceptibility were associated with increased resistance to mycobacterial infection. IFNAR1 SNP rs2843710, shown previously to exhibit increased susceptibility to enterovirus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, did not display a significant association with active TB in the current study (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">The extracellular domains of class II helical cytokine receptors, of which IFNAR1 is a member, are composed of discrete subdomains separated by distinctive poly-proline, inter-domain hinges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The presence of such poly-proline hinges between functional receptor subdomains leads to structural rigidity of the protein thereby dictating the conformational state of the receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Factors that perturb protein rigidity, including mutation or substitution of proline residues in inter-domain hinge regions can increase protein flexibility thereby decreasing ligand-binding affinity and altering protein conformational states and protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although the minimal ligand-binding domain of IFNAR1 is limited to its three membrane-distal subdomains (SD)1&#x02013;3, the membrane-proximal subdomain (SD4) of IFNAR1 is required to undergo a conformational change for optimal IFN-induced signal transduction across the cell membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Given this evidence from the literature, we hypothesized that deletion of Pro335 from IFNAR1-ECD would reduce the rigidity of the inter-domain hinge between IFNAR1 SD3 and SD4, thereby increasing inter-domain flexibility and altering the IFN-&#x003b2; binding kinetics. The fact that IFNAR1-ECD-Del, compared to its WT counterpart, shows reduced affinity for IFN-&#x003b2; strongly suggests that deletion of Pro335 from IFNAR1-ECD has indeed increased flexibility of the receptor. Taken together, our results suggest that SNP rs72552343 has reduced IFNAR1 functionality by altering IFN binding kinetics and thereby modifying receptor response upon ligand engagement, reducing the magnitude of STAT1 activation and subsequent ISG induction measurable from the mutated receptor.</p><p id="Par21">It remains to be determined how the proline deletion attenuates IFNAR signaling in the heterozygous individuals. There is, however, a precedent in the literature for the heterozygous expression of a SNP that results in a missense mutation in human IFNAR1 to alter the function of the receptor.
