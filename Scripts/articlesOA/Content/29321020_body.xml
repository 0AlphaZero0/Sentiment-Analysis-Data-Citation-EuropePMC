<sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par23">The causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), infects about one third of the world&#x02019;s population. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million individuals progressed to active disease and 1.3 million died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prolonged duration of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection as well as the alarming emergence of multi-drug resistant strains makes the development of new and effective anti-tubercular therapeutics a global health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The severity of TB is largely dependent upon the modulation of human cellular and immunity pathways by the <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogen. The majority of infected patients develop latent TB (LTB) infection, in which they are asymptomatic with no clinical evidence of disease for years or decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During latent infection, <italic>Mtb</italic> is phagocytosed by macrophages, which trigger host immune response involving the recruitment of additional macrophages and monocytes that ultimately form an organized structure called granuloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. <italic>Mtb</italic> is dormant and non-replicative within granuloma which suppresses the immediate threat of active infection while evading further immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Approximately 5&#x02013;10% of LTB patients will go on to develop active pulmonary TB (PTB), in which <italic>Mtb</italic> returns to the replication mode and provokes an active host immune response. When the granuloma breaks down, sequestered <italic>Mtb</italic> can be released into the airway and becomes transmissible to other hosts.</p><p id="Par25">Currently, the standard TB therapy involves a regimen of four antibiotics taken during an initiation phase of two months and a continuation phase of 4&#x02013;7&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite a high efficacy at the onset of administration, the confounded intervention and prolonged treatment period present challenges for patient compliance and potentially foster the emergence of multidrug-resistance of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Thus, it is imperative to develop more effective therapeutic approaches such as host-directed therapies. Targeting the host has its advantages in potentially being less susceptible to the drug resistance problem, with greater opportunities for repositioning known drugs to new indications.</p><p id="Par26">Recent genome-wide studies of host-pathogen interactions provide new insights into human genes and pathways modulated by pathogen infection and proliferation. Multiple studies have generated extensive human microarray gene expression datasets for subjects infected by <italic>Mtb</italic> with the overall objective of developing diagnostic biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, by comparing 14 public human gene expression datasets for LTB, PTB and other respiratory diseases, Sweeney et al. identified a three-gene set that was robustly diagnostic for PTB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no systematic search for potential host therapeutic targets against TB has been published.</p><p id="Par27">Previously, we applied integrated analysis to human gene expression data in response to respiratory bacterial and viral infections in order to identify novel host targets and potential drug repurposing opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, we performed a statistical meta-analysis on human gene expression data available for <italic>Mtb</italic> infection to identify common human transcriptomic signatures characteristic of TB. The advantage of meta-analysis lies in its capability to alleviate potential study-specific biases and enhance statistical power to identify robust expression signature through increased sample size. We leveraged other evidence such as human genetic disease associations and drug-repurposing analyses to prioritize individual targets and compounds. We identified multiple host genes and pathways that were significantly altered in TB and propose several potential drug candidates for repurposing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources, filtering and selection</title><p id="Par28">Human microarray gene expression datasets in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#x02019;s (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>), by searching &#x02018;Tuberculosis&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>&#x02019; and &#x02018;expression profiling by array&#x02019;.

In our study, a plethora of DEGs and pathways were identified in PTB infection. In comparison, no known host process was identified in LTB. This is consistent with a paucity of host immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> during the latent stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and highlights the challenges of LTB detection and treatment.</p><p id="Par51">Blood gene expression represents a mixture of immune cell subpopulations, which renders the question whether expression signatures derived from whole blood or PBMCs could recapitulate those of individual cell types. Overall, the similarity between gene expression signatures of <italic>Mtb</italic> challenged patient blood and the immune cell subsets was modest, which is in agreement with previous observations of large variation in expression profiles among different immune cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, dendritic or THP-1 cell-types DEGs shared with those found in blood have significantly higher fold changes compared to non-shared DEGs, which implicates that genes bearing a stronger expression signal in individual cell type could be more readily detected in the broader blood expression profiles. Moreover, the finding that common genes between blood and dendritic cells were enriched in cell type specific pathways indicates that blood gene expression signatures at least partially recapitulate the major signals from these immune cell types when subjected to <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure.</p><p id="Par52">Our meta-analysis supports multiple known host responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and suggests several novel host targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

Among the <italic>IFN</italic>-inducible genes, <italic>HLA-DPA1</italic>, <italic>PSMB8</italic>, <italic>PSMB9</italic>, <italic>TAP1</italic> and <italic>TAP2</italic> were proximal to rs3129750, a highly significant genetic variant associated with TB (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.51e-22), providing genetic support for these genes as potential host targets. <italic>PSMB8</italic> and <italic>PSMB9</italic> are the targets of Carfilzomib, a proteasome inhibitor for multiple myeloma.</p><p id="Par53">We found evidence for TB activation of several pathways more commonly associated with other non-infectious diseases, which could be informative for drug repurposing opportunities. For example, the <italic>LRRK2</italic> pathway linked to Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and <italic>PD-1</italic> signaling pathway in immuno-oncology were both significantly enriched during PTB infection. <italic>LRRK2</italic> was a highly significant DEG (fold change&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.73, FDR-adjusted <italic>P&#x02009;=</italic>&#x000a0;1.7e-4) in the meta-analysis and directly interacts with seven other DEGs in the pathway, including two components in the NRON complex through which <italic>LRRK2</italic> inhibits the immune response transcription factor <italic>NFAT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

A recent patient cohort analysis revealed a 1.38-fold risk of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease in TB patients independent of other clinical factors, suggesting the co-morbidity between the two diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Modulating host ubiquitin pathways could be another important strategy to reactivate host innate response against <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p id="Par56">Our searches of DrugBank using the 407 DEGs revealed 19 highly supported drug-target links encompassing 14 drugs and 16 targets. Among these, the drug intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIg was found targeting two Fc receptors and one complement component as either an antagonist or a receptor binder, thus supporting the phagocytic pathway of <italic>Mtb</italic> as a potential druggable target. IVIg is used to treat patients with primary immunodeficiency and has been applied to a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. An in vivo mouse experiment showed the efficacy of high-dose IVIg in substantially reducing the bacterial load during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

Of particular interest are two sodium channel blockers and two voltage-gated calcium channel blockers.

Further experimental validation of both IVIg and ion channel blockers is merited to explore their application in TB host-directed therapies.</p><p id="Par58">Previously, we performed meta-analysis of human gene expression datasets to identify host targets and drug repositioning opportunities against respiratory bacterial and viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, we applied an overall similar strategy to identify same opportunities for the treatment of TB. Despite an overall common data analysis methodology, there are multiple novelties in the current study compared to our early work in respiratory bacterial and viral infections. First, instead of using a vote-counting method with arbitrary cutoffs on the number of studies in which a gene was declared significant, we employed the combining effect size method of the statistical meta-analysis which essentially yields one single biologically interpretable measure - the pooled effect size (and <italic>P</italic>-value) of differential expression. The combining effect size method has been suggested as the most comprehensive approach for meta-analysis of two-class gene expression microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Second, we assessed the robustness of the meta-analysis results by cross-validation in other independent patient blood datasets, and comparison to in vitro cell type specific datasets. Third, additional genetic evidence from public GWAS datasets was used in this study to further prioritize individual DEGs as potential therapeutic targets for TB. Fourth, a PPI network was employed to obtain protein-protein interaction modules important in TB and generate novel targets (i.e. <italic>UBC</italic>) that may play a role in regulating the expression of multiple TB-related host factors. Fifth, with respect to drug repurposing analysis, CMAP analysis was performed to generate additional hypotheses based on anti-correlation relationships between gene expression signatures in diseases and drug perturbations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">In summary, our meta-analysis provides new insights into host genes and pathways important for TB infection and brings forth potential drug repurposing opportunities for host-directed therapies (perhaps as potential combination therapies with anti-mycobacterium drugs).
