<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although great effort has been made to improve the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB), mortality and morbidity remains high, with more than 9.0 million new cases and more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide each year [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.TB</italic>) infection generally remains asymptomatic as a so called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). However, it will reactivate to active TB (5&#x02013;15%) when individuals are co-infected with HIV, are using immunosuppressive drugs, have diabetes mellitus and/or a compromised immune system [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although host-pathogen interactions determine the outcome of <italic>M.TB</italic> infection, the immunological factors involved in the host immune response network in <italic>M.TB</italic> infection and LTBI reactivation have not yet been clearly elucidated. Up to now, there is has not been a useful method for discriminating active TB from LTBI.</p><p>Current interferon-&#x003b3; release assays (IGRAs) that detect IFN-&#x003b3; release from T cells in response to 2 <italic>M.TB</italic>&#x02013;specific antigens (ESAT-6 and CFP-10), including T-SPOT.<italic>TB</italic> and QuantiFERON-TB, can accurately determine the presence of <italic>M.TB</italic> infection [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, they cannot further discriminate active TB from LTBI or predict when LTBI will develop into active TB. Previous studies have demonstrated that cytokine and chemokine responses after ESAT-6 and CFP-10 stimulation have the potential to discriminate active TB from LTBI [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. But these studies were limited in their scope in regards to cytokine and chemokine families and ignored the other genes that could have better discriminative potential.</p><p>Microarray platforms are capable of reliably and reproducibly measuring the expression of over 40,000 mRNA transcripts, which can encompass all of the known functional human genome [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A number of studies using this approach have identified different panels of diagnostic signatures that discriminate active TB from LTBI, including the genes related to IFN signaling, toll-like receptor (TLR), T- and B- cell function, TREM1 signaling and myeloid cell inflammation, <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, these studies screened for signatures in whole peripheral blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific stimulation. Because many kinds of immune cells with different gene expression patterns are included in whole blood, the interpretation of blood-derived transcriptional signatures must be made in the context of the cellular composition, which was varied depending on the ethnic background and the scale of host response to a disease [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. PBMCs have been used to control this variable. But without <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific stimulation, TB-associated transcriptional profiles may be masked in PBMCs by interference from other conditions, such as other diseases or drug use. Furthermore, the discrepancies among these studies may also be attributable to differences in genetic background.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to further uncover the host immune factors involved in the progression from LTBI to active TB and identify the potential signatures for discriminating TB from LTBI. Using PBMCs from active TB patients, LTBI individuals and healthy controls (HCs), we performed a genome-wide transcriptional profile analysis of PBMCs stimulated with the <italic>M.TB</italic>&#x02013;specific antigens, ESAT-6/CFP-10, from which we were able to identify a TB-associated gene profile.</p><p>Our results may not only help to identify the immunological factors that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of active TB, but also provide 2 novel genes that may have the potential ability to discriminate active TB from LTBI.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Gene profiling of <italic>M.TB-</italic>specific antigen-stimulated PBMCs from active TB, LTBI and HCs</title><p>Genome-wide microarray analysis was employed to examine the gene expression profiles of <italic>M.TB-</italic>specific antigen-stimulated PBMCs from active TB, LTBI and HC groups. The genes that exhibited significant changes in expression (fold change &#x02265; 4 and <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05 between 2 groups) were selected for further analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Comparison of transcriptional profiles indicated that LTBI and HC groups exhibited similar patterns, with only 35 differentially expressed genes. The TB group exhibited a significantly different profile when compared to LTBI (<italic>n</italic> = 209) and HC (<italic>n</italic> = 234) groups. A total of 352 differentially expressed genes were identified when deducting the number of shared genes amongst the 3 pair-wise comparisons. Comparison of TB with the other 2 groups shared the biggest number of differentially expressed genes (<italic>n</italic> = 114). <italic>F3</italic> was the one gene that was shared in all 3 pair-wise comparisons. Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed to determine whether the 352-gene profile could reflect the different statuses of <italic>M.TB</italic> infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). It showed that the 12 subjects were successfully clustered into 3 groups, and each group matched exactly to the clinical grouping of active TB, LTBI and HCs.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Genome-wide gene profile of M.TB-specific antigen-stimulated PBMCs from active TB, LTBI and HCs</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differentially expressed genes with <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 and fold change &#x0003e; 4 in pair-wise comparisons; (<bold>B</bold>) Unsupervised cluster analysis of 352 differentially expressed genes in the pair-wise comparisons.Note: TB, tuberculosis; LTBI, latent tuberculosis infection; HCs, healthy controls.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-08-112907-g001"/></fig><p>The criteria with fold change &#x02265; 2 and <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05 between 2 groups was also used to select the differentially expressed genes, and it exhibited more differences in each pair-wise comparison (TB vs. LTBI: <italic>n</italic> = 1050, TB vs. HCs: <italic>n</italic> = 1256, LTBI vs. HCs: <italic>n</italic> = 479, respectively. <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>KEGG and GO analysis was performed to further elucidate the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes in the <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigen-stimulated PBMCs between TB and the other 2 groups (LTBI and HCs).

Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and linoleic acid metabolism were the shared significant pathways between TB and the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway pooled the largest number of genes and presented the most significant difference between TB and the other 2 groups (TB vs. LTBI: included 14 genes and Bonferroni-corrected <italic>P</italic> = 4.394e-04; TB vs. HCs: included 18 genes and Bonferroni-corrected <italic>P</italic> = 4.901e-05) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). With regard to the GO analysis, enrichment <italic>P</italic>-value (Bonferroni-corrected <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and the pooled number of genes (included &#x0003e; 20 genes) were used to rank the GO term. A total of 17 ranked GO terms were detected in the comparison of TB with LTBI, while 24 ranked GO terms were detected in the comparison of TB with HCs.

Based on this criterion, 13 differentially expressed genes between TB and LTBI, and 13 differentially expressed genes between TB and HCs were selected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Seven genes overlapped, and these genes were all statistically significant in both TB vs. LTBI and TB vs. HCs in microarray test comparisons (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Identifying the immunologic parameters involved in active TB will help improve early diagnosis and facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis involved in the transition of latent infection to TB activation. In this study, microarray techniques were applied to compare the transcriptional profiles of active TB patients, LTBI and HC individuals. Further qPCR analyses validated our microarray results and confirmed that the expression of RETN and KLK1 genes was significantly different between TB and the other 2 groups (LTBI and HCs). The combination of these 2 genes demonstrated the potential to discriminate TB from LTBI and HCs.</p><p>Unlike previous microarray studies using non-stimulated whole blood or PBMCs, our study examined the transcriptional profiles of <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigen (ESAT-6/CFP-10)-stimulated PBMCs to investigate gene expression changes between TB and the other 2 groups. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 have been confirmed as specific antigens with good immunogenicity in pathogenic <italic>M.TB</italic> and have been widely used in the IGRA tests and novel skin tests for detecting <italic>M.TB</italic> infection [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Compared with tuberculin (PPD)-stimulation, which is a mixture of multiple <italic>M.TB</italic> antigens, stimulation with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 can induce a <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific immune response, while excluding the non-specific immune response triggered by other mycobacterium or BCG vaccination. Furthermore, based on IGRA tests or novel skin tests that discriminate <italic>M.TB</italic> infection from healthy controls, the differentially expressed genes of ESAT-6 and CFP-10-stimulated PBMCs between TB and LTBI may further discriminate the different infection status.</p><p>Similar with previous studies [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the differentially expressed genes between TB and the other 2 groups in our study were primarily associated with stimulus response, indicating the variances of PBMCs in response to <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigens between different infection statuses. KEGG analysis showed that differentially expressed genes between TB and the other 2 groups were mainly pooled in cytokine-cytokine receptor pathways, suggesting that the cytokine and cytokine receptor genes are important in TB occurrence and development. These results are consistent with previous studies that detected different patterns of cytokines or chemokines between TB and non-TB group (LTBI, HCs or other pulmonary diseases) in response to <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigens or <italic>M.TB</italic> strains [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, a blood RNA signature, including 16 genes for tuberculosis disease risk, has been validated [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Two of these 16 genes were also differentially expressed between TB and LTBI in our study (APOL, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.031; GBP4, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.044). Kaforou et al found a 27-transcript signature distinguished TB from LTBI using a whole blood RNA microarray [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Four of these 27 genes were also differentially expressed between TB and LTBI in our study (GAS6, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0076; S100A8, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0030; C5, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.029; FAM20A, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.028.). Among the 393-gene signature of active TB from Berry et al [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], 32 genes also presented a significant difference between TB and the other 2 groups in our study. The overlap of genes between previous studies and our study indicates that our microarray test results are reliable.</p><p>For the first time, RETN was detected as a differentially expressed gene that is increased in active TB patients compared to LTBI and HC individuals upon stimulation with <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigens. RETN is a 12.5 kDa cysteine-rich peptide that is mainly produced by monocytes and macrophages [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a member of the resistin-like molecule (RELM) family, a small family of secreted pro-inflammatory proteins, RETN can trigger a pro-inflammatory state in inflammatory responses, mediates metabolic disturbances and promotes cell proliferation [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that RETN is associated with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which indicates that RETN could be involved in the host immune response process. It has been reported that RETN can induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in PBMCs and, can promote macrophage polarization in an independent process [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, we found that RETN expression was significantly increased in active TB patients compared to LTBI and HC individuals. The higher expression of RETN may induce the increased pro-inflammatory cytokines production, which were also detected in TB patients in our study.</p><p>Human tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are a 15-member group of serine proteases. KLK1 is a key component of the kallikrein-kinin system and may activate protease activated receptors (PARs) in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is well established that KLK1 can prompt Lysyl-bradykinin release from low molecular weight kininogen through the cleavage of 2 peptide bonds involving Met-Lys and Arg-Ser, which confers to KLK1 the ability to act as both a chymotrypsin and a trypsin-like enzyme [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that KLK1 can protect against lupus and anti-glomerular basement membrane-specific antibody-induced nephritis in mice and humans [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], indicating KLK1 may be involved in autoimmunity response processes. In our study, KLK1 gene expression was decreased in active TB patients. Although there is no report on the association between KLK1 and active TB, recent microarray analyses have also detected that the expression of KLK11 and KLK12 are decreased in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>-infected cows [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Although the RETN or KLK1 genes alone have moderate performance in discriminating active TB from LTBI and HCs, their discriminative ability was enhanced when these 2 genes were combined. The immunological changes that occur when transitioning from a healthy status to <italic>M.TB</italic> infection and then to active TB are undoubtedly comprehensive and complicated. Thus, it is unrealistic to rely on one single gene to accurately diagnose active TB. The combination of multiple genes will substantially achieve better diagnostic performance [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Previous studies on discovering the biomarkers for active TB diagnosis have also detected a panel of genes that have better discriminative ability [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study using <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigen (ESAT-6/CFP-10)-stimulated PBMCs to elucidate the differences of human immune responses between active TB, LTBI and healthy controls. Notably, our study was performed in a Chinese population, whereas previous studies were performed in European and South African populations that have different genetic and TB epidemiology backgrounds. However, there are some limitations in our study. First, due to the small number of the samples in the microarray set, the effect of inter-individual differences cannot be avoided, although independent sample sets were used to validate the microarray results. Second, although the number of differentially expressed genes between TB and the other groups in the microarray test were numerous, only the genes with top fold change were selected for validation by qPCR. We cannot exclude the genes with moderate fold change may also provide discriminative value. Third, there is lack of controls for non-TB pulmonary diseases. Further studies with well-designed patient and control groups are required to validate the usefulness of the identified genes for TB. Lastly, a blinded sample set was not used when validating the discriminative ability of RETN and KLK1. A further study utilizing a larger sample size and blinded analyses should be performed to validate the combination of RETN and KLK1.</p><p>In conclusion, our study uncovered a genome-wide expression profile of <italic>M.TB</italic>-specific antigen-stimulated PBMCs in different <italic>M.TB</italic> infection statuses and identified the combination of RETN and KLK1 genes to have potential value in distinguishing active TB from LTBI individuals and healthy controls. These results provide a new potential diagnostic signature for discriminating active TB and LTBI and have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis involved in the transition from latent infection to TB activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Active TB patients were recruited from Beijing Chest Hospital between May 2009 and September 2017.
