<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diarrheal diseases are a major global health challenge that disproportionately affect children in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Mexico, diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of death in children under five [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192082.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among this age group, the state of Yucatan has one of the highest incidence rates of diarrhea nationwide (26,618 cases/100,000) [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192082.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite their morbidity and mortality, diarrheal diseases in children are routinely diagnosed and managed based on clinical observations rather than pathogen-specific tests. However, clinical diagnosis and risk stratification is inaccurate and there is a need for straightforward, rapidly identifiable and inexpensive biomarkers that more accurately predict underlying pathogenesis. Historically, a combination of stool culture, serologic tests, and RT-PCR tests have been required to diagnose the cause of illness [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recently, molecular diagnostic tests for detecting pathogens in stool samples have been developed and blood-based gene expression signatures designed to discriminate between bacterial and viral infections have been developed, but high costs have limited their use in resource-poor settings. [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In a broader context, blood transcript profiling has provided mechanistic insight into a variety of diseases, including infectious disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disease [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The exquisite sensitivity and specificity of whole blood transcript profiling in other studies suggests that it may also offer the potential to determine infectious etiology of diarrheal diseases by serving as a sensor for host peripheral immune responses.</p><p>We hypothesized that pathogens causing diarrheal diseases would elicit distinct patterns of gene expression in host peripheral blood that could be used to characterize immune responses associated with each pathogen and with disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on whole blood samples collected from children with acute diarrheal illness, within 8 days of disease onset, as well as from healthy control (HC) subjects. Transcript profiling by RNA-seq allows for quantitative, unbiased analysis of all expressed genes. Here we present results on whole blood transcript signatures from children infected with pathogens causing diarrheal disease, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> species, <italic>Shigella</italic> species, and rotavirus serotypes. Relative to HC, we observed both pathogen-non-specific and pathogen-specific changes in host gene expression that provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of these diseases, and suggest potential organism-specific biomarkers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>Clinical studies were conducted from 2010 to 2014 at the Hospital General O&#x02019;Horan, a major referral hospital in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. Children under 10 years of age seeking medical care at the Pediatric Emergency Room for acute community-acquired diarrhea (less than 8 days) were invited to participate. Patients with underlying gastrointestinal or immunological disorders, including recent GI surgery, were excluded from the study. Healthy, age-matched controls were children visiting the clinic for routine vaccinations or simple fractures. On admission, a trained nurse applied a standardized questionnaire to collect demographic and clinical data. Stool and blood samples were collected from each child on or shortly after admission. Stools were collected in two sterile containers; one contained Cary-Blair media for isolation of bacterial pathogens and the other with no transport media was used for detection of rotavirus. Whole blood was collected in EDTA and Tempus tubes. EDTA tubes were sent to the routine clinical laboratory for complete blood counts. Tempus tubes were frozen at -20 &#x000b0;C and shipped to the Benaroya Research Institute on dry ice. Stool and blood samples were transported to the laboratory within 1 hour. Each individual was assigned a severity category based on a modification of the World Health Organization criteria as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Laboratory procedures</title><p>All stool samples were inoculated onto XLD (<italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> detection), Hektoen Enteric (<italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> detection), Brilliant Green (<italic>Salmonella</italic> detection), Cefex (<italic>Campylobacter</italic> detection), TCBS (<italic>Vibrio</italic> detection) and MacConkey (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> detection) agar, as well as tetrathionate (<italic>Salmonella</italic> detection), Rappaport (<italic>Salmonella</italic> detection) and alkaline peptone (<italic>Vibrio</italic> detection) broths and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 18&#x02013;24 h.

In comparisons of signatures between these groups, we found that leukocyte subset proportions were the primary source of host transcript variation. Thus, development of diagnostics based on whole blood gene signatures associated with these diseases should include consideration of cell type proportions. We also found that cell type proportions were related to time since symptom onset. Neutrophil counts were higher earlier in disease, whereas lymphocytes became elevated later. This is consistent with an early, innate immune response in patients, followed by an adaptive response after several days of infection.</p><p>Our findings increase our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in diarrheal illnesses. Although it is well established that rotavirus induces an interferon response in intestinal epithelial cells, less is known about systemic interferon response to rotavirus [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192082.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Increased expression of alpha and beta interferons has been noted in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of children with rotavirus infection [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A broad-based interferon response signature has been observed from blood samples of patients with other disease such as influenza and tuberculosis, but to our knowledge, an interferon response signature in whole blood of rotavirus patients has not been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192082.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Complement is well known to play an important role in the immune response to many pathogens. However, upregulation of early classical complement genes has not previously been observed in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, and rotavirus infections [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192082.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>It is also noteworthy that <italic>Shigella</italic> and rotavirus infections had both the highest total monocyte proportions and highest early classical complement pathway gene expression, but that expression of complement genes in these patients was not correlated with proportions of monocytes. Although most complement is produced by the liver, monocytes also produce complement [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192082.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The lack of a correlation we observed suggests a decoupling of early complement mRNA levels from monocyte proportions in blood. In contrast, we did observe a strong correlation between neutrophil levels and complement mRNA expression. Neutrophils are a well-known site of complement activity, but they are not generally thought to be a major source of complement proteins [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Further experimentation would be needed to assign production of complement to any cell type, the correlations we have observed lead us to hypothesize that that neutrophils may regulate levels of complement expression in diarrheal illnesses.</p><p>By profiling multiple pathogens, we learned about the utility of gene expression in peripheral blood for distinguishing pathogens with similar symptomology. For other pathogens other than <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, we were able to identify specific genes associated with each infection. Our finding suggests these genes could be evaluated for accuracy as biomarkers for identification of the causative pathogen in infectious diarrhea. We also discovered limitations on the value of these signatures. For example, we observed no relationship between gene expression signatures and disease severity after accounting for differences in leukocyte proportions. We also detected no age-related differences in early complement and interferon response gene expression. This was surprising given that age has previously been associated with clinical symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tracking serial infections over time while stratifying for age and severity in a future study could offer finer resolution of the interactions between age, severity, infection type and host response. The scope of our study was limited to examining the host response to infection by four pathogens, but other pathogens such as <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, the parasites <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> also contribute to childhood diarrheal disease [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is possible that the transcriptional pathways we report here are shared with these or other species that were outside of the scope of this study.</p><p>Although we studied patients with disease ranging from mild to severe, the patients in our study had been sought care for diarrheal disease and likely represent a more severe subset of cases than would be found in the general population. However, the gene signatures we observed did not depend on disease severity, which suggests that they would be broadly applicable. Even if confined to the context of hospitalized patients these signatures offer value. In cases requiring hospitalization, they could be used to develop tests that inform the decision-making process to determine care for the sickest patients. Currently, cost considerations are a barrier to the adoption of RNA-seq assays as a rapid diagnostic in areas with limited resources. However, future innovations in generating inexpensive microfluidics &#x0201c;lab on a chip&#x0201d; approaches, combined with decreasing sequencing costs could make transcriptional profiling accessible to clinicians and hospitals with limited resources in the future [<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192082.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The implication of host interferon responses in rotavirus, inflammasome activation in <italic>Shigella</italic>, and complement in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, and rotavirus indicates the ability of blood profiling to reflect the pathogenesis of these diseases.
