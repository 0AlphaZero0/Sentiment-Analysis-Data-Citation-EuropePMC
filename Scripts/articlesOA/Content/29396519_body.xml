<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The cells of innate immune system particularly macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) provide the first line of defence against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and they are among the first few cells to interact with the bacteria upon infection in the host. Macrophages and DCs utilize a wide variety of surface receptors including toll-like receptors, opsonic receptors, mannose receptors, etc. that recognize antigenic molecules on the bacterial surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Engagement of bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with these host cell receptors results in the bacterial uptake and entrapment of bacteria in the phagosomes. The members of nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily not only regulate the signalling through such pathogen recognition receptors but have also been shown to sense the lipid components of mycobacteria by their direct binding to such lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The NR superfamily that comprises a total of 49 members has been categorized into three families namely, endocrine, adopted orphan and orphan NRs on the basis of the nature of the ligand they bind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">A growing literature about NRs in infectious diseases highlights that they are important in shaping up the innate immune responses and several pathogens, for their own benefits, have evolved strategies to modulate NRs either by changing their expression or by interfering with their transcriptional activity. For example, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> induce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg) in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Expression of Pparg is also elevated in response to a PAMP called mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan obtained from the cell wall of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, silencing of Pparg in macrophages significantly reduces the bacterial burden supporting the pro-bacterial role for Pparg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition to Pparg, another NR named testicular receptor 4 (Tr4) also acts as a molecular switch and by regulating the macrophage polarization towards M2 phenotype, augments the bacterial survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The infection with intracellular bacteria like <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> also elevates the levels of liver X receptor alpha (Lxra) in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, infected macrophages have elevated levels of Lxra target genes suggesting that transcriptional programs induced by Lxra promote the clearance of bacteria inside the macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In agreement with these findings, Lxra deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to bacterial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Also, along with Lxr the binding sites of retinoic acid receptor (Rar) are enriched in H3K4me1 regions (a marker for active or poised enhancers) in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected THP-1 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In accordance with these findings, studies performed on human DCs infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> also revealed enrichment of Lxr and Rar binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from active pulmonary TB patients revealed an altered expression in vitamin D receptor (Vdr) associated genes compared to the individuals with latent bacterial infection. Vdr-regulated genes are also enriched in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected THP-1 cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Many other members of NR superfamily which includes glucocorticoid receptor (Gr), pregnane X receptor (Pxr), Nr1d1, and Vdr have also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, NRs are amicable to modulation by small molecules (which are either available or can be synthesized easily) and hence numerous endogenous and synthetic NR ligands have been evaluated in various infection models as potential therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> is unique in its ability as it successfully parasitizes both macrophages and DCs, which in traditional view are considered as host sentinels for initiating protective immunity against bacterial infections. With the emergence of knowledge about the cross-talk between host NRs and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, it is compelling to identify all those NRs which have a bearing on the persistence and pathogenesis of mycobacteria in macrophages and DCs. A composite gene expression analysis of NRs performed in macrophages and DCs has suggested a regulatory role of NR superfamily in macrophages and DC functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, these studies have examined the expression of these NRs only in the presence of a PAMP or an immunological modulator and we still need to unravel a composite list of all NRs being modulated by mycobacteria in its innate immune cell niches. In this study, we performed a detailed expression profiling of NR superfamily in murine macrophages and DCs upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In conjunction with identifying NRs whose role in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis has not yet been established we also recapitulated some of the findings which have been previously published. Intriguingly, we observed that NRs such as Vdr, Lxra, Pparg, Rarg, Nr4a&#x02019;s, RAR-related orphan receptor alpha (Rora), androgen receptor (Ar), and thyroid hormone receptor beta (Thrb) were undergoing differential regulation in both macrophages and DCs upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection suggesting a plausible cross-talk between these NRs and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Interestingly, our analysis also revealed Rora and Nr4a3, both of which have not been previously implicated in TB infection, undergo changes in expression upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We identified that <italic>H37Rv</italic> induces the expression of Rora while the expression of Nr4a3 was significantly reduced in murine and human macrophages. We also observed a similar pattern in the expression of Rora and Nr4a3 in murine DCs and PBMCs obtained from patients with active TB. Therefore, examining the potential of ligands for such NRs as an approach to anti-TB therapy could be promising.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of NRs modulated by <italic>M. tuberculosis H37RV</italic> in mBMDCs</title><p id="Par5">Being an intracellular pathogen, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resides in cell types such as macrophages and DCs. Among these, macrophages have been largely the focus for studying cross-talk of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with the host. However, given the unique ability of DCs to initiate T cell responses, DCs could possibly regulate the adaptive immune responses against the bacteria. Recently DCs have been shown to express certain repertoire of NRs, few of which have also been shown to regulate DC functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. So, in order to address whether this pathogen has the ability to modulate any of these NRs in DCs and thereby DC function, in this study, we infected mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (mBMDCs) with <italic>H37Rv</italic> and monitored the expression of NRs relative to uninfected control cells. We selected 0&#x02009;h, 12&#x02009;h, and 48&#x02009;h post infection as the time points which allowed us to identify the changes in the transcript levels of NRs during early and later stages of infection. Interestingly, we found that the levels of some NRs were being altered upon infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Among the endocrine NRs, <italic>Ar</italic>, <italic>Rarg</italic>, <italic>Thrb</italic>, and <italic>Vdr</italic> underwent significant downregulation of greater than 2-folds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). While <italic>Ar</italic> and <italic>Vdr</italic> remained constantly repressed during later time points of infection, the expression of <italic>Rarg</italic> and <italic>Thrb</italic> started to rescue at 48&#x02009;h post infection. The adopted orphan NRs, <italic>Lxra</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic> were downregulated at 12&#x02009;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) followed by an enhanced expression of <italic>Lxra</italic> and recovery of <italic>Pparg&#x02019;s</italic> basal expression at 48&#x02009;h after infection.

Taken together, our data identifies the members of NR superfamily which are being significantly modulated in mBMDCs upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Of these, Vdr, Lxra and Pparg have already been shown to have an explicit role in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis thereby indicating plausible implication of other altered NRs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mapping NRs expression profile in mBMDCs infected with mycobacterium <italic>H37Rv</italic>.

A similar kind of analysis revealed that unlike mBMDCs, in mBMDMs certain NRs started responding during the early time point of infection (0&#x02009;h).

On the contrary, Pparg increases the persistence of bacteria inside the host cells and our recent findings demonstrated that it does so by driving the alternative activation of macrophages thereby promoting the fitness of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, rosiglitazone, a ligand to Pparg, enhances the bacterial survival inside the macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In concordance with earlier studies, we found a dynamic change in the expression of Pparg upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Interestingly, this study also identified changes in the expression of Nr4a3 and Rora, whose functions remained unknown in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. While the expression of Nr4a3 was significantly decreased in macrophages and DCs, the expression of Rora was found to elevate in the infected cells. The PBMCs obtained from TB patients also showed significant changes in the expression of Nr4a3 and Rora pointing towards their plausible role in bacterial infection. Hence, it is conceivable that the dynamics of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection might be regulating the expression of those NRs that either enhance successful intracellular parasitisation by bacteria or are responsible for its clearance. Therefore, it will be interesting to decipher the function of other differentially regulated NRs with no reported role in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par12">On the other hand, we observed that few NRs are constitutively expressed at high levels without undergoing any significant changes upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection but have a reported role in its pathogenesis such as Tr4. Tr4 acts as a molecular switch and by regulating the macrophage polarization towards M2 phenotype, augments the bacterial survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In a recent published study, it has been elucidated that the lipid components of mycobacterial cell wall binds to Tr4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This leads to the transactivation of Tr4 thereby inducing foamy biogenesis and granuloma formation. It has now been appreciated that sometimes rather than the NR expression it is the changing repertoire of the host cellular lipids, which act as ligands for these NRs, that regulates their function. This led us to speculate that NRs with high expression might also be having a plausible role in the clearance or persistence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. However, detailed functional studies should be performed for validating their roles in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. It has been revealed that Pxr, an adopted orphan NR, increases the survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in its host niche (human macrophages)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. But in corroboration with other reports, we found insignificant expression of this NR in studied murine cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Given the fact that the current TB treatment is complex and often results in poor patient compliance, there is a compelling need for new drug regimens which are more effective with shorter treatment period. Most drugs developed till date to cure mycobacterial infections target crucial enzymatic processes in the bacterium such as transcription, translation or biosynthetic pathways like cell wall synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In addition to developing new novel TB-drugs that are directed against bacterial processes, there is also an increasing interest in developing therapeutics that are not directly bactericidal but target host pathways used by bacteria for either infecting, persisting or replicating inside the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In this connection, the findings that NRs modulate several cellular pathways that are important for bacterial survival inside the cell and their amenability to pharmacological modulation makes it interesting to explore the possibility of utilizing NRs as targets for anti-TB therapies. Adding small molecules that can regulate the activity of NRs in ways that strengthen the microbicidal properties of macrophages and DCs along with standard TB-drugs may significantly reduce the duration of TB treatment. Moreover, this adjunct therapy may also be effective in providing treatment against latent bacteria which is otherwise resistant to the anti-TB drugs.</p><p id="Par14">Collectively, our study suggests the existence of a complex interplay between host NRs and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. These NRs may provide immense opportunities as potential therapeutic targets that can regulate immune responses thus directing protective immunity against infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Human ethics statement</title><p id="Par15">The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh, India and the Ethics and Biosafety Committee of the IMTECH, Sector 39&#x02009;A, Chandigarh, India.
