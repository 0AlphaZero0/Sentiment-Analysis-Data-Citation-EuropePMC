<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The type I interferon (IFN-I) family has a central role in antiviral immunity as well as the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases: most notably in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but also implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Many of the strongest genetic susceptibility variants for SLE encode proteins in the innate immune response including molecules involved in endogenous immune stimuli intensification, production of IFN-I, and regulation of cellular response to IFN-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Blockade of IFN-&#x003b1; or the shared IFNAR receptor have both demonstrated efficacy. In RA, IFN-I is found in the synovium and is a biomarker in pre-clinical disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. IFN activity is variable within and between autoimmune diseases and may have value in diagnosis, stratifying subtypes of disease and selecting patients for interferon-targeted therapy. However, measurement of IFN-I status is complex and existing IFN-I biomarkers show poor or inconsistent correlations with disease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> as well as response to IFN-I-blocking therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Because direct measurement of serum IFN-I proteins is insensitive, IFN-I activity is usually measured indirectly using expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) as either a &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d;, which usually refers to a categorical variable representing high or low expression of ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, or a &#x0201c;score&#x0201d;, which usually refers to a continuous variable derived from level of expression of a set of selected ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">ISG-based assays have limitations. First, the group of genes identified as ISGs may not represent a single immune phenomenon. The interferon transcriptome is modular with sets of ISGs described that respond not only to IFN-I but also to IFN-II and -III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> as well as non-IFN pathways. Second, gene expression may vary between circulating cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and so assays that use whole blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or unsorted PBMCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> may show apparent differences in level of ISG expression that are in fact due to changes in the size of cell populations; such changes are characteristic of autoimmune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Lastly, previous IFN scores were bimodal (high or low) but the relative merits of bimodal categorization or continuous analysis have not been compared.</p><p id="Par5">Our objective was to develop and clinically validate continuous Interferon Stimulated Gene Expression (ISG) scores for evaluation of IFN-mediated diseases, accounting for modularity of the ISG transcriptome, cell-specific expression, response to IFN-subtypes and bimodality of expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Interferon Gene Expression Scoring</title><p id="Par6">We first performed Taqman analysis of 10 genes from each of three IFN-annotated modules previously described, followed by Factor Analysis (FA) to determine whether the gene expression values of multiple genes were driven by a smaller number of unobserved (latent) continuous variables. We included 49 HC (mean (SD) age at sample 31.7 (8.8); 65% female), 114 SLE (45.7 (14.5); 93%), 133 UCTD (47.7 (15.1); 86%) and 32 RA patients (52.2 (15.5); 72%) (total n&#x02009;=&#x02009;328).</p><p id="Par7">When the FA was performed in the 31 genes, KMO values confirmed the sample adequacy; overall KMO&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93 (&#x02018;superb&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>) and KMO values for each of the individual genes all exceeded the acceptable 0.5 limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

However, The determinant of the correlation matrix was low (&#x0003c;0.00001) when all genes were included, indicating multicollinearity between expression values in the 31 genes. Repeating the factor analysis in a reduced set of 19 genes selected for low squared multiple correlation with the others increased the determinant to 0.00002 but gave very similar results (data not shown) therefore we proceeded with the full gene set.</p><p id="Par8">The parallel analysis indicated that up to 7 factors were present in the data (Fig. S1); however, a simpler solution with fewer cross-loaded items was obtained with 2 factors, which still explained 84% of the variance.

These modules revealed different strength of association with disease activity. In a previous publication expression of these modules in patients receiving exogenous IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; for hepatitis C and multiple sclerosis respectively suggested that module M1.2 was responsive only to IFN-&#x003b1; and modules M3.4 and M5.12 were also responsive to IFN-&#x003b2;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These data may have been affected by the disease under study, but interferome data also indicated that modules M1.2 and M3.4 were induced by IFN-&#x003b2; more than IFN-&#x003b1; and both M3.4 and M5.12 were also responsive to IFN-II (IFN-&#x003b3;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Our factor analysis segregates ISGs in a similar fashion to this work: Score B mostly included genes found in M3.4 and M5.12. However, although there was a trend to a less selective IFN-&#x003b1; response in Score B our <italic>in vitro</italic> data did not show such a clear relationship between ISG subsets and subtypes of IFN.</p><p id="Par28">Another hypothetical explanation for these ISG sets is that they reflect changes in numbers of circulating immune cells, which characteristically occur with disease activity in autoimmunity or immunosuppressive therapy, such as lymphopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Our results did not support this explanation; we found both scores to be upregulated in SLE in all cell types. We cannot exclude the possibility that other non-IFN immune mediators may influence the clustering of ISGs. Further studies would be needed to answer this. Nevertheless, we have shown that separating ISG expression into two scores is clinically relevant. Most notably, many papers have described IFN activity in RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, but we show that this is qualitatively different to SLE, with elevation of IFN Score B only.</p><p id="Par29">Our factor analysis also expanded on previous work by measuring IFN activity as a continuous score instead of the bimodal classification as &#x0201c;IFN-high&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;IFN-low&#x0201d; commonly reported in other studies. Previous studies defined variable IFN-scores using as bimodal (High/low) [5, 6] either by 95% centile of Healthy donors as cutoff or &#x0003e;50% of the patients overlapping with HC as IFN-Low. This classification has led to inconsistent results in prediction of response to IFN-blocking therapy [6&#x02013;8]. We found that both scores are indeed bimodal; there are two overlapping normal distributions underlying the distribution seen in patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A and B</xref>). However, these distributions are not equivalent to normal and abnormal; many healthy individuals were in the high group. Further, there was variation within the high and low groups according to diagnosis. It therefore appears more appropriate to use a continuous measure of IFN activity in research or clinical practice.</p><p id="Par30">Other ISG-based assays showed association with disease activity in cross-sectional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, particularly with skin lupus, but not with other common manifestations such as arthritis and haematological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, these were inconsistent with other studies failing to demonstrate any association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Most did not adjust for activity in multiple organs and confounders. This is important because of the clinical and immunological heterogeneity of SLE. Patients with active or inactive disease in one organ system may have simultaneous activity in other organ systems independently. We controlled for this variability with multivariate analysis and by comparing patients with single-organ disease only. This revealed a variable relationship between IFN activity and different manifestations of SLE, with notably increased IFN activity in skin, but not musculoskeletal, disease activity. This explains the poor or inconsistent relationship between IFN and global disease activity reported in other studies. Both of our IFN scores showed associations with serology and features of disease activity (BILAG domains) in adjusted models, albeit with some differences in strength, indicating their advantage for stratifying disease. Further, we found a difference in interferon profile between patients who experienced flares and patients with internal organ involvement, which suggests that these two scores will be of greater value in longitudinal studies, which we are currently conducting.</p><p id="Par31">In conclusion, we describe novel IFN scores as a new method to analyse the IFN-I pathway in autoimmunity.

For cDNA synthesis from total RNA acquired, Fluidigm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Reverse Transcription Master Mix buffer was used according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions including a mixture of random primers and oligo dT for priming. TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen) were used to perform the qPCR (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). TaqMan Gene Expression Assays were performed using the BioMark&#x02122; HD System and appropriate cycling protocols for the 96.96 chip. Expression of lineage markers and ISGs was analysed by relative quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#x02013;PCR) using TaqMan reagents from Applied Biosystems.

Effect sizes from each imputed dataset were Fisher z transformed, averaged across imputations, then back-transformed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Factor Analysis</title><p id="Par38">Factor analysis (FA) was used to determine whether the gene expression values of multiple genes were driven by a smaller number of unobserved (latent) continuous variables. FA included expression levels for ISGs measured in the PMBCs from SLE, UCTD, RA and HC.</p><p id="Par39">Prior to factor analysis (FA), undetected &#x02206;Ct values were singly imputed using the R package nondetects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was used to verify the sampling adequacy of the analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Principal factor extraction, without rotation, was used to identify the optimum number of factors, which was initially determined according to a parallel analysis (Monte Carlo simulation using 1000 replications). This indicated the maximum number of factors present, but if a smaller number of factors were required to explain 80% of the variance, and resulted in lower levels of cross-loading (genes loaded by 2 or more factors at &#x0003e;0.4), a simpler structure was selected. Having identified the number of factors present, oblique (promax; kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) rotation was used to obtain the final factor solution. To calculate factor scores, within each patient median gene expression was calculated for genes loaded at &#x02265;0.4 by each factor, provided they did not cross-load onto more than one factor. The advantage of this approach was that it reflected the variability of the data, and respected the within-patient ordinal scaling of delta Ct values where some genes were below the detection threshold, but yielded factor scores in units (delta Ct) that were easily interpreted in subsequent analyses.</p><p id="Par40">Factor scores were calculated as the median expression (dCt scale) of genes loaded by each factor at &#x02265;0.4, provided they were not loaded by more than one factor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par41">To compare gene expression levels between sorted cell subtypes, substantive descriptive differences were considered evidence of heterogeneity, given the sample size.

Cell subsets were considered nested at the patient level. Monocytes were the reference against which other cell types were compared.</p><p id="Par43">Analysis of covariance, controlling for age, compared patients with SLE to those with RA and to HC. Post-hoc pairwise tests were corrected for multiplicity (Tukey HSD method). Effect sizes (partial omega squared) were calculated; we considered effect sizes to be small (0.01), medium (0.06) or large (0.14) as described by Cohen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par44">Multiple imputation by chained equations was used to impute missing disease activity measures within SLE patients (for details see supplementary material).</p><p id="Par45">IFN scores were modelled as a function of ANA count, low complement, lymphocyte count and anti-dsDNA titre using linear regression. Linear regression was then used to relate IFN scores to presence of individual BILAG organ activity (A, B or C) controlling for age and each of the blood measures of disease activity described above. Quantile (median) regression was used to relate total BILAG and SLEDAI scores to IFN scores, controlling for the same covariates.</p><p id="Par46">Finite mixture modelling (FMM) was used to explore whether IFN-Scores-A and -B each represented a mixture of 2 or more distributions. On the dCt scale, normal (Gaussian) distributions were assumed. Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to compare the fit of models with 1, 2 or more components. We restricted the analysis of distribution of individual gene expression to patients in whom expression could be measured.</p><p id="Par47">We performed an analysis of available longitudinal data in our patients as a pilot for future formal longitudinal studies. We selected 60 patients across a spectrum of levels of IFN Score A and Score B and reviewed casenotes for objective flare and involvement of internal organs. Objective flare was defined by documentation of flare accompanied by clinical signs such as joint swelling, or confirmatory investigations such as renal biopsy, as well as new or increased treatment within 3 months of biomarker testing. Internal organ involvement was defined by confirmed and treated lupus activity in cardiorespiratory, renal and CNS systems at any prior date. 2<sup>&#x02212;dCT</sup> values were compared using Mann Whitney U tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
