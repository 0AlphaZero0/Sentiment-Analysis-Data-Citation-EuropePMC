<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Despite the availability of four anti-tubercular drugs and BCG vaccine against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection, tuberculosis still remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide, claiming over 1.5 million lives globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is estimated that one third of the world population is infected with Mtb, however only 5&#x02013;10% of individuals develop the active tuberculosis disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, whereas the rest remain latently infected during their life time. Therefore defining the immune correlates which leads to host protection or pathogenesis during tuberculosis infection, could lead to the development of new alternative drug treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Macrophages regulate inflammation and immune responses to Mtb infection. However, Mtb modulates host immunity by residing and multiplying within lung macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In response to IFN&#x003b3; which is secreted by T helper 1 cells and natural killer cells, macrophages are polarized to classically activated macrophages (M1 Mph), leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, inducing protective immune responses against Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. IFN&#x003b3; stimulation activates IFN&#x003b3; receptors, Janus kinase, MHC class I and II, guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), chemokine receptors Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Cxcl4, Cxcl5, immune regulatory transcription factors such as Irf1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, Irf8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, Batf2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, Stat1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, Nf&#x003ba;b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, Ap1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and many effectors molecules such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-12, TGF&#x003b2;, IL-10 cytokines and Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, RANTES (Ccl5) chemokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore IFN&#x003b3; induces phagocyte oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2) that control Mtb growth by their antimicrobial activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Several studies showed a sharp increase of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 which polarize macrophages to an alternative activation status (M2 Mph)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. During this alternative activation process M2 Mph induces Arginase 1 (Arg1) which is a checkpoint enzyme since it competes with Nos2 for the same substrate L-Arginine. By metabolizing L-Arginine, Arg1 reduces Nitric Oxide (NO) production, tryptophan degradation and T cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Consequently Mtb has developed a myriad of evasion strategies to escape killing within M1 polarized macrophages by interfering with the macrophage activation status. Once infection is established within macrophages, Mtb is able to down-regulate IL-12 expression in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and thereby reducing optimal Th1 differentiation and subsequent IFN&#x003b3; production. Moreover, Mtb blocks the recruitment of NOS2 to the phagosomal membrane, possibly as a means of limiting its exposure to nitric oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Once phagocytosed, Mtb employs its prime evasion strategy to interference with intracellular signaling events to establish persistence. Mtb inhibits phagolysosome fusion, thus allowing virulent mycobacteria to persist within an immature phagosomal compartment that shields from the microbicidal challenges activated by the host cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore the interaction between Mtb and M1/M2 macrophage that leads to a drastic genetic or epigenetic level reprogramming is still an area that needs to be further investigated.</p><p id="Par3">Over the last few decades, transcriptional programming of Mtb-infected macrophages has been studied using oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression was analyzed from IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated, live Mtb, heat-killed Mtb, polystyrene beads-stimulated primary macrophages obtained from wild-type, NOS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Phox<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and NOS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Phox<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> which shows that gene induction by Mtb mimicked or synergized with IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mtb-infected macrophage-like THP-1 gene profiling using microarray demonstrated an interferon-related signature in transcriptional core response to Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Using 858 spot cytokine array from Mtb-infected human monocytes-derived macrophages gene profiling up to 7 days after infection with Mtb showed up-regulation of previously known cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Recently it was also demonstrated that the macrophage transcriptional responses changes depending on Mtb strain infection (CDC1551 expressed higher levels of stress response genes than HN878)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A previous comparative study of gene expression profile of IFN&#x003b3; or IL-4 stimulated macrophages using microarray showed a delayed and partially diminished response to Mtb in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. The result highlight that IL-4-stimulated alternative macrophages may supports intercellular persistence of Mtb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Of note, large consortia such as ImmGen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and the Human Immunology Genome Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> have contributed immensely by discovering the steady state transcription programs of murine macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and dendrite cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recently the FANTOM5 consortium has generated a comprehensive promoter expression atlas using 953 human and 399 mouse samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, including classical, intermediate, non-classical monocyte samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which demonstrated promoters for known and novel coding/non-coding transcripts and enhancer expression profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. CAGE (Capped Analysis of Gene Expression) technology was used for this transcriptome analysis and samples were sequenced using single molecule Helicos sequencer (non-biased deepCAGE). The second phase of FANTOM5 further revealed that enhancers reach maximal transcriptional activity prior to promoters in differentiation and activation of mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Recently as a satellite study of FANTOM5 we redefined the transcriptional regulatory dynamics of classically and alternatively activated mouse macrophages by identifying novel motifs, TFs, coding and non-coding marker genes using deepCAGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here we focused on the transcriptional landscape of MtbHN878-infected macrophages compared to classical (IFN&#x003b3; stimulated, M1) and alternative (IL-4/IL-13 stimulated, M2) activation by high throughput transcriptome analysis method, deepCAGE. Further, pre-stimulation with IFN&#x003b3; or IL-4/IL-13 in Mtb-infected macrophage transcriptome was compared with non-pre-stimulated Mtb-infected macrophages. DeepCAGE analysis allowed us to identify drastic transcriptional reprogramming in Mtb infection and in IFN&#x003b3; or IL-4/IL-13 pre-stimulation in Mtb infected macrophages. Taken together our CAGE analysis identified novel TFs, non TF genes and lncRNAs therefore redefining the transcriptional landscape of Mtb-infected macrophages.

Macrophages are also the primary (obligatory) target cells for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), we designed and characterized the transcriptional and kinetic (0, 4, 12, 24, 48&#x02009;hours) landscape of macrophages during Mtb infection using hyper-virulent strain Bejing Mtb HN878. Differentially expressed genes in each condition/time point were compared among M1-and M2-stimulated BMDMs and non-activated Mtb-infected BMDM&#x02019;s (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, see comparison I). Further, we compared differentially expressed genes of M1- and M2-pre-activated Mtb-infected BMDM&#x02019;s (IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb and IL-4/IL-13_Mtb) with those of non-pre-activated Mtb-infected BMDM&#x02019;s (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, see comparison II), which was designed to explore the differential effects of macrophage M1 and M2 pre-activation in Mtb infection. Total RNA was extracted from harvested cells and subjected to non-amplified deepCAGE transcriptomics using single molecule Helicos sequencers. A flow chart describing the CAGE analysis pipeline was shown for the better understanding of deepCAGE transcriptome analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The CAGE tags, computationally mapped on mouse genome (version mm9), ranged from 460,316 to 18,969,698 with a median of 2,655,669 mapped tags among all these libraries (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/">http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/</ext-link>). Tags were clustered to identify transcription start site (TSS) regions and create promoter activity profiles (see Materials and Methods). The profiles of three biological replicates showed high correlation in each data point (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). To verify the quality, we explored the induction of typical and well-known marker genes for M1/M2 activations and Mtb infection; as expected, expression of these marker genes were drastically up-regulated during M1/M2 activation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) as well as during Mtb infection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), suggesting that both activation and infection were successful.

Conclusively, Mtb infection perturbs many TFs involved in various macrophage transcriptional regulatory networks including M1/M2 activations, leading to drastic and complex transcriptional reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pre-stimulation with IFN&#x003b3; and IL-4/IL-13 showed global effects in transcriptomics of Mtb-infected macrophages</title><p id="Par13">Next, we explored how Mtb infection with IFN&#x003b3; or IL-4/IL-13 pre-stimulation affects gene expression changes in macrophage (comparison II in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As shown in the comparison I (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), IFN&#x003b3;- and IL-4/IL-13-mediated gene expression changes were temporal, as a consequence few differentially expressed genes were observed at 24&#x02009;h post stimulation, the starting time for Mtb infection. Differentially expressed genes were extracted at each time point after Mtb infection with IFN&#x003b3; or IL-4/IL-13 pre-stimulation (IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb or IL-4/IL-13_Mtb, respectively). We obtained 3162 and 2935 differentially expressed genes for IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb and IL-4/IL-13_Mtb, respectively (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a to d</xref>). Including the differentially expressed genes in non-stimulated and pre-stimulated Mtb, a total of 3806 differentially expressed genes were found overall.

In non-stimulated Mtb-infected macrophages, the number of differentially expressed genes was small (75 genes), while in IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb or IL-4/IL-13_Mtb we found that the number was several fold higher with 565 and 464 differentially expressed genes, respectively. This suggests that M1 and M2 pre-stimulation promotes distinct and additional differentially expressed genes in Mtb infection. We next explored time kinetics of differentially expressed genes of the three conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>). The early time point at 4&#x02009;h, commonly up- and down-regulated genes were dominating, but rapidly decreasing with time, with small number of common genes expressed at 48&#x02009;h.

We clustered the differentially expressed genes into 7 clusters based on their expression profile (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Cluster 1 showed progressive up-regulation, clusters 2, 3 and 7 showed sustained up- and down-regulation during time, and Cluster 4 to 6 transient up- or down-regulation. The number of genes in each cluster shows that Mtb has small populations of progressively up- and sustained down-regulated genes (clusters 1 and 7, respectively) in comparison with IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb or IL-4/IL-13_Mtb (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

Further, significant population of sustained up-regulated genes in cluster 2 of IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb and IL-4/IL-13_Mtb were transiently up-regulated genes in cluster 4 of Mtb. Similarly, significant population of sustained down-regulated genes in clusters 7 of IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb and IL-4/IL-13_Mtb are transiently down-regulated genes in clusters 6 of Mtb. The shifts indicate that pre-stimulation prolonged differential expression in a set of genes. On the other hand, there are few genes that shift opposite direction. Taken together, the results demonstrate global effect that IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb and IL-4/IL-13_Mtb reveal differentially expressed genes for long time which is in part due to prolonged gene expression change.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Cluster distribution of differentially expressed genes between Mtb and IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb (A) and between Mtb andIL-4/IL-13_Mtb (B).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="8">Mtb</th></tr><tr><th>Cluster 1</th><th>Cluster 2</th><th>Cluster 3</th><th>Cluster 4</th><th>Cluster 5</th><th>Cluster 6</th><th>Cluster 7</th><th>Un-differentially expressed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb (A)</td><td>Cluster 1</td><td>24</td><td>23</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 2</td><td>5</td><td>228</td><td>32</td><td>153</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 3</td><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>104</td><td>22</td><td>21</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 4</td><td>0</td><td>60</td><td>7</td><td>365</td><td>51</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>74</td><td>65</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>435</td><td>16</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>237</td><td>148</td><td>334</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">IL4/IL13_Mtb (B)</td><td>Cluster 1</td><td>27</td><td>26</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 2</td><td>7</td><td>250</td><td>11</td><td>154</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 3</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>104</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 4</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>5</td><td>323</td><td>46</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>73</td><td>75</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 6</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>363</td><td>6</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>262</td><td>163</td><td>277</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mtb infection augmented cytokine-mediated M1 and M2 activations</title><p id="Par16">To explore Mtb-induced differentially expressed genes that are drastically affected in pre-stimulation-specific manner, we selected pre-stimulation-mediated elevated and suppressed non TF genes (more or less than 10-fold) and TF genes (more or less than 3-fold) in IFN&#x003b3;_Mtb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref> to S6d).

This drastic gene expression change was mediated by expressional alteration of various known and novel Mtb-infection related TF genes including both M1 and M2 activation.

Thus, this Mtb-mediated wide range response may be partly responsible for alteration of large number of gene expression in macrophages. We also observed high population of Mtb-induced down-regulated genes, which is consistent with relatively high number of down-regulated TF genes. Because down-regulated genes are rare in M1 or M2 activation, this observation is one of characteristic in Mtb infection. Actually, GO terms related to dis-regulation of basic cellular functions are enriched in the down-regulated genes. However, it is elusive whether those down-regulated genes are pathogenic effect of Mtb infection, since it may be a side reaction that macrophages converge host-protective response.</p><p id="Par24">We showed that M1 or M2 pre-activation in Mtb-infected macrophages augmented M1 or M2 effector genes, respectively. Although molecular mechanism how the augmentation occurs remains to be elucidated, this reaction is interesting from the view of host protection and subversiveness. Mtb infection in M1 pre-activated macrophages enhances expression of inflammatory genes, which seems a reasonable host-protective reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. On the other hand, because Mtb favors to reside within M2 polarized macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, augmentation of M2 effector genes in Mtb-infected M2 pre-activated macrophages is considered to be host subversive. The later reaction may be host evasion mechanisms employed by Mtb to establish its persistence and survival within M2 polarized macrophages.</p><p id="Par25">We also successfully identified differentially expressed lncRNAs in Mtb-infected macrophages. Although M1 or M2 pre-activation enhanced altered lncRNAs as well as coding transcripts, the number of commonly altered lncRNAs was not high and the majority of the alteration was indeed down-regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. We showed in a previous report that majority of M1- or M2-mediated differentially expressed lncRNAs was up-regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, unique feature of altered lncRNAs in Mtb infection may have significance. Recently, many lncRNAs have been demonstrated to play a role of transcriptional regulation of their neighbor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In fact, we detected positive correlation of expressional change between altered lncRNAs and their neighbor genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). These functional perturbation analysis of newly identified lncRNAs should enable us for a deeper and better understanding of the role of these transcripts in Mtb-infected macrophages.</p><p id="Par26">This comprehensive promoter-based transcriptome data of Mtb-infected macrophages, together with previously reported data, will be a valuable resource for the research community, particular in immunology, for gaining new insights into Mtb host evasion. Newly identified protein-coding and noncoding transcripts, which altered in Mtb infection in the presence and absence of M1 or M2 pre-activation, may serve as potential transcriptional biomarkers of Mtb infection. Further, those altered transcripts could be a potential source, leading to host-directed Mtb drugs, as part of them may be regulated by Mtb to be host subversive, and may be resistant to drug tolerance and prolonging current Mtb drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages</title><p id="Par27">BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred in South Africa.

In total, we obtained 8,426 expression profiles (since most of the genes were differentially expressed in more than 1 condition). The data were log10 transformed, after adding an offset of 0.1. Subsequently, for each gene we scaled the data to the mean expression of 0 within the control time points and to standard deviation of 1.
