<sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par24">Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons. The majority (74%) of TB-HIV coinfected persons reside in Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Overall, HIV-infected are 20&#x02013;30 times more likely to develop active TB than those without HIV infection, with an annual risk as high as 5&#x02013;15% per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The transition from latent TB infection (LTBI) to active disease in HIV-infected depends on host immunity and on the level of immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count is only an approximate measure of the degree of immunosuppression at the population level and thus an inaccurate marker of the likelihood of reactivation in a HIV-infected host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Along the spectrum of infection, individuals with asymptomatic active disease (subclinical TB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are clinically unrecognized and often progress to active symptomatic TB disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a high prevalence setting, 8.5% of asymptomatic, HIV-infected persons had positive sputum cultures for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Even when sputum culture is used to exclude active TB, asymptomatic cases may be misclassified particularly in the immunosuppressed where disseminated disease may predominate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. HIV-infected with occult TB are at risk of unmasking TB-IRIS, which has significant morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, new approaches to the diagnosis of TB in this group are imperative.</p><p id="Par26">Transcriptional profiling studies have identified several different biosignatures that can differentiate active TB from LTBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and from other related inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two of these, the 27-gene signature identified in the study by Kaforou et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the 251-gene signature reported by Dawany et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], performed well even in HIV-infected individuals. The biosignatures derived from these multiple cohorts do not show significant overlap. However, publically available databases provide a wealth of material for meta-analysis and derivation of a biomarker signature that can potentially function across cohorts. Using this approach, a targeted Real Time-PCR (RT&#x02013;PCR) array was designed by Maertzdorf and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] based on two of their microarray datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and then applied to a new cohort from India. This strategy generated a 4-biomarker set (<italic>GBP1</italic>, <italic>IFITM3</italic>, <italic>P2RY14</italic> and <italic>ID3</italic>) that performed satisfactorily even in HIV-coinfected individuals. Subsequently, a 3-gene set consisting of <italic>GBP5</italic>, <italic>CD64</italic> and <italic>GZMA</italic> was identified that accurately separated TB from OPD (other pulmonary diseases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Other studies have shown that <italic>CD64</italic>, <italic>FcGR1B</italic> and <italic>LTF</italic> are differentially expressed in TB versus other lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], using a total of 14 datasets identified a different set of three genes (<italic>GBP5</italic>, <italic>DUSP3</italic>, and <italic>KLF2</italic>) that were highly diagnostic for active tuberculosis in HIV infected and uninfected populations. Validation studies confirmed that this 3-gene set separated active tuberculosis from healthy controls, latent tuberculosis and other diseases. The usefulness of this gene set in monitoring treatment response is under-scored by the observation that the expression of the 3-gene set declined during treatment of patients with active tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In another multi-site study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], a targeted approach was used to validate genes identified in single-site populations. This study found that <italic>FcGR1A</italic> was the most reliable classifier of active TB and its expression was not confounded by HIV status or ethnic background. The performance of <italic>FcGR1A</italic> was not compromised even in advanced HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Similarly, another recent study analyzed new and previously published data on blood transcriptional profiles and found that elevated transcript levels of <italic>BATF2</italic> can also robustly discriminate active TB from healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the study found elevated <italic>BATF2</italic> levels even in the absence of TB in HIV negative individuals who presented with various other infectious diseases. The authors concluded that <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript may have better value as a test for ruling out TB. We therefore tested the accuracy of <italic>FcGR1A,</italic> which was not confounded by HIV status, and <italic>BATF2</italic>, which had better negative predictive value for TB, in discriminating active TB in the context of coinfection with HIV.</p><p id="Par27">Biomarkers for tuberculosis have also been identified through serum proteomic profiles. A comparison of TB cases to healthy controls identified fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Orosomucoid (ORM) as potential biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Another study found that levels of serum amyloid A, transthyretin, C-reactive protein, and neopterin discriminated patients with TB from other respiratory disorders (ORD) and inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In comparison to LTBI and ORD, serum samples from TB patients expressed a biomarker panel of 8 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This study also found that in the HIV coinfected TB patients, the composition of the host protein biomarker panel was slightly different and consisted of 10 host proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

We found that the DEG that were over-expressed in Cluster 1 had significant overlap with this 43-transcript signature (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

In the seminal study of O&#x02019;Garra and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], an IFN signature was associated with TB. However, it was surprising to see a strong IFN&#x003b3; response in patients with CD4<sup>+</sup> counts &#x0003c;&#x02009;100. Other innate cell types, including &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and NK cells secrete IFN&#x003b3; during TB infection (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]). It would be interesting to investigate the cell type(s) producing IFN&#x003b3; in advanced HIV since it may provide opportunities for developing flow cytometry-based diagnostic tools. Even if the specificity of such an assay is low, it would serve as a potential point-of-care triage test. CXCL10 is selectively up-regulated in TB pleural effusions compared with malignant effusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and in lateral flow based test it showed promise as a diagnostic tool for pleural TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. CXCL10 is also one of the seven-marker serum protein biosignature for the diagnosis of active TB disease in African primary healthcare clinic attendees with signs and symptoms suggestive of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In our study plasma levels of CXCL10 accurately classified TB in 91% of the TB-HIV patients, indicating the potential of this analyte as a diagnostic biomarker.</p><p id="Par46">A study from Lai and colleagues found a consistent over-abundance of 43 genes encompassing innate immune mediators of the TLR and inflammasome signaling pathways in TB-IRIS participants, 2 weeks before they developed IRIS when compared to non-IRIS controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is not clear why the TB-HIV participants in our cohort who did not progress to IRIS also had a high innate inflammatory signature. One possibility is the timing of the blood sample collection for transcriptomics. The blood samples in our study were obtained from participants prior to anti-TB treatment, whereas in the Lai study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] they were collected following approximately 1 month of anti-TB therapy. Given that even 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment is sufficient to significantly down-modulate the TB gene signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], the baseline samples collected prior to ART, but post anti-TB treatment, from TB-HIV coinfected participants may have a lower expression of inflammatory genes. Therefore in the Lai study, using these baseline samples as comparator, the increase in inflammatory genes associated with TLR and inflammasome signaling could be detected as early as 0.5&#x000a0;week following ART in only those progressing to IRIS. The mechanisms leading to enhanced inflammation in untreated TB versus in those developing IRIS may be different, but since the mediators of inflammation are non-specific, the gene signature for TB in the HIV-infected and that for IRIS may overlap. Thus, our findings would suggest that use of gene transcript sets as biomarkers for predicting IRIS should take into account the TB treatment status of the TB-HIV subjects.</p><p id="Par47">Although the sample size in this study is small, nonetheless, pathway analysis (through IPA) of the transcriptional data provides a few clues to the underlying mechanisms leading to the enhanced inflammatory response in the TB-HIV group. For example, TLR signaling, p38 MAPK signaling and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis were some of the top upregulated pathways. Interleukin-1&#x003b2;, one of the upregulated upstream regulators is clearly essential for anti-mycobacterial immunity but excessive amounts of the cytokine is pro-inflammatory and can cause tissue damage (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), also referred to as colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), another upregulated upstream regulator, also contributes to anti-mycobacterial immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, in the context of autoimmune disease, GM-CSF is a strong inducer of tissue inflammation and plays a critical role in disease progression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]). EIF2 signaling and primary immunodeficiency signaling were the top downregulated pathways. Phosphorylation of Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is activated by diverse stress responses and results in repression of global translation, except for the translation of select genes, including <italic>ATF4</italic> (activating transcription factor 4). ATF4 is a master regulator of the integrated stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Interestingly, treating macrophages with the drug Guanabenz increased the phosphorylation level of eIF2&#x003b1; and resulted in elevated mRNA levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This leads to the conjecture that the decreased EIF2 signaling may be related to the enhanced inflammatory response seen in TB-HIV. Granzyme A signaling was another downregulated pathway. Since Granzyme-A is expressed by NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells and is a tryptase that induces a caspase-independent cell death [68], its downregulation is suggestive of functional defects in the two immune cell types. Alefacept, is a dimeric fusion protein made up of the extracellular CD2-binding portion of the human leukocyte function&#x02013;associated antigen 3 (LFA-3) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Alefacept preferentially targets CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and therefore in the context of HIV fits as one of the upstream regulators that was found to be downregulated. IL-15, a cytokine critical for NK cell proliferation and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell development, was another upstream regulator that was downregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Overall, the IPA data point to upregulated and downregulated pathways as well as regulators that could together result in increased inflammation in TB-HIV. This is further reflected in the increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers in plasma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">Overall, we found that plasma protein levels of IFN&#x003b3; and CXCL10 and gene expression of <italic>FcGR1A</italic> and <italic>BATF2</italic> have the potential of independently detecting TB in advanced HIV.
