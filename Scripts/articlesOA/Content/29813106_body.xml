<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kawasaki disease (KD) is a febrile vasculitis of unknown etiology that affects young children. The estimated annual incidence is 17&#x02013;21 per 100,000 children under the age of 5 in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies have shown that treatment within the first ten days of illness with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin significantly reduces the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the diagnosis of KD is challenging, especially for children whose presentation lack the full clinical spectrum, termed as &#x0201c;incomplete&#x0201d; KD. A delay or lack of diagnosis of both complete and incomplete KD may have long-term consequences [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Children with KD that develop persistent or recrudescent fever after IVIG are at higher risk of developing CAA. In Japan, the application of clinical scoring systems to identify children at higher risk for treatment failure and thus developing CAA, has proven useful to intensify primary treatment with IVIG with adjunctive treatments such as corticosteroids [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in the multi-ethnic, non-Japanese population such as that in the United States, identification of children at high-risk for non-response to IVIG and/or development of CAA has been difficult using clinical criteria alone.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the value of gene expression profiling to aid in the assessment of disease severity in children with infectious or autoimmune diseases, and to differentiate KD from other mimicking conditions [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The major goals of this study were to utilize gene expression profiling: 1) to define a KD transcriptional biosignature that can aid in the characterization of complete and incomplete KD in children, 2) to define the specificity of the KD biosignature compared with that from children with other febrile illnesses such as adenovirus and Group A streptococcus infections (GAS), and 3) to assess the value of a genomic score [molecular distance to health (MDTH)] assessed before IVIG treatment to determine the likelihood of non-response to IVIG therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>From June 2007 to March 2013, we prospectively enrolled and obtained blood samples in a total of 162 children &#x0003c; 18 years of age; 125 children hospitalized with KD or other febrile illnesses and 37 healthy, asymptomatic children as controls who were age-, gender- and race-matched. Of the 125 hospitalized children, 89 meet the definition of KD [76 met criteria for complete KD and 13 for incomplete KD based on the American Heart Association (AHA) criteria [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], 19 patients had confirmed adenovirus infection, and 17 children had GAS infection. All children with KD were enrolled before IVIG treatment and sequential samples collected at 24 h and 4&#x02013;6 weeks post-IVIG in a subset of KD patients. Healthy controls were enrolled when undergoing elective surgery for non-infectious related causes, or at routine outpatient visits.</p><p>Study participants were enrolled, as a convenience sample, at three hospitals: Nationwide Children&#x02019;s Hospital in Columbus, OH, Children&#x02019;s Medical Center in Dallas, TX and Rady Children&#x02019;s Hospital in San Diego, CA. The Institutional Review Boards (IRB) from these institutions approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from legal guardians.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design and definitions</title><p>To define the KD signature, KD patients were divided into three groups: a training, a validation set (test set) that included children with complete KD, and a third set of children with incomplete KD. To determine the specificity of the KD signature, KD transcriptional profiles were compared with those of children with GAS and adenovirus infections. Finally, to determine if the transcriptional genomic perturbation assessed by the molecular distance to health (MDTH) genomic score could predict clinical outcomes, we calculated the MDTH score from KD patients pre-IVIG treatment and assessed its ability to predict the response to IVIG and the development of CAA, after adjusting for other variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197858.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We also assessed changes in MDTH, in children with KD in whom sequential samples were available. Coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) were defined as a Z score &#x02265;2.5 for either the right coronary artery or left anterior descending at any time point, and IVIG resistance as persistent or recrudescent fever at least 36 hours after completion of IVIG treatment.</p><fig id="pone.0197858.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0197858.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of study patients.</title><p>Patient allocation and analyses performed throughout the study is depicted in Fig 1.

<italic>Molecular distance to health (MDTH)</italic>, a tool that converts the global transcriptional perturbation of each sample into an objective score compared with the healthy controls as reference, was calculated and correlated with parameters of disease severity. To calculate the MDTH scores we used the dispersion of expression values found in the baseline samples (controls) to determine whether the expression values of a patient&#x02019;s given sample lay outside two standard deviations (&#x000b1; 2SD) of the mean value for the healthy controls. Thus, each individual score represents the overall transcriptional perturbation (&#x0201c;distance&#x0201d;) per patient sample in relation to the healthy control baseline. By summarizing the overall transcriptional activity in one score, the MDTH facilitates correlation with clinical parameters and has previously been applied in other disease states [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Univariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify which factors independently predicted IVIG resistance, the primary outcome. Although the study was not adequately powered for this purpose, as an exploratory objective, we also examined if MDTH could predict the development of coronary artery abnormalities (CAA, either coronary aneurysm or ectasia). We first calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) using the pre-treatment MDTH values to determine its ability to discriminate responders versus non-responders to IVIG. The optimal threshold for MDTH was defined using Youden&#x02019;s J statistic, which maximizes sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For multivariable analyses, covariates were included in the model if they were significant in univariate analysis or clinically relevant. Predictor variables with a p &#x0003c;0.05 and multivariate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals that did not include 1 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using, Graph Pad Prism V5 (San Diego, CA) and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Kawasaki Disease transcriptional signature is reproducible in children with both complete and incomplete presentation</title><p>To define the transcriptional KD signature, children with complete KD (cKD) were divided randomly in two cohorts: training (discovery) and test (validation) sets.

We also identified classifier genes that discriminated KD patients from those with adenovirus infection quite precisely and less so from patients with GAS, two common conditions that mimic KD. Lastly, we defined a genomic MDTH score at presentation that was associated with resistance to IVIG therapy. Overall, this study confirms the potential application of transcriptional profiling for the diagnosis of KD and the utility of genomic scores to predict response to therapy in children with KD before IVIG treatment.</p><p>Previous studies have also described overexpression of innate immunity transcripts and down regulation of T and B cell receptors and NK cell signaling in patients with KD compared with febrile control patients [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the present study, we identified a distinct and reproducible KD biosignature that was validated in a second independent cohort of KD patients, and more importantly in a third group of children presenting with incomplete KD, supporting the value of the current clinical criteria for the diagnosis of KD.</p><p>Host expression patterns based on RNA transcriptional profiles have been used to distinguish bacterial from viral infection in young febrile infants and children [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and also to discriminate patients with KD from those with adenovirus infection [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although appealing, it is challenging to use host expression patterns in a disease that lacks diagnostic confirmation, especially in those with the less common incomplete presentation of the disease. One example of a similar scenario in which diagnostic confirmation is challenging is pediatric tuberculosis. In a recent study, a genomic signature was identified first in children with confirmed TB and was then applied to patients with &#x0201c;probable&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;possible&#x0201d; disease with 82% sensitivity and 84% specificity. This approach emphasizes the utility of genomic signatures when initially applied to patients with clearly defined illness, followed by application to other cohorts with less defined clinical diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We followed a similar approach as we first derived the KD biosignature from children with complete KD, and then applied it to children with less clearly defined illness, incomplete KD. Indeed, it was remarkable to observe that patients with incomplete KD had a profile almost identical to those with cKD. The peripheral blood KD biosignature, for both complete and incomplete KD, was characterized by marked overexpression of inflammation, apoptosis, platelets and neutrophil genes, and with marked underexpression of cytotoxic T cell and NK cell related genes. This is in contrast to the findings of gene expression at the level of coronary tissue, where cytotoxic T cells have been shown to be upregulated [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These findings have significant implications at they suggest that complete and incomplete KD share similar immunopathogenesis. In addition, these findings emphasize the importance of early identification and treatment of patients with incomplete KD, as their immune response is similarly dysregulated. It also adds to the validation of the AHA clinical criteria to identify and diagnose patients with incomplete KD [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Distinguishing patients with adenovirus infection from KD can be difficult as adenovirus infections are common in this age group, often result in elevated inflammatory markers, and because adenovirus can be detected incidentally in children with KD [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The present study showed that transcriptional profiling can help discriminate adenovirus from KD with high accuracy, confirming previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The modular analysis provided additional detail of the biological differences between the two conditions. KD patients had overexpression of two of the three interferon modules. The overexpression of module 1.2, more reflective of type I interferon, however, was absent in children with KD [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In agreement with these findings, previous studies have reported that KD patients had reduced expression of type I interferon transcripts compared with those with adenovirus infection [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Using transcriptional profiles to differentiate KD from GAS infection proved to be more difficult, though distinguishing KD from GAS disease in the clinical setting is less problematic as the organism can be isolated from the pharynx or blood in most cases of invasive disease. The majority of patients in this group had GAS identified from a normally sterile body site, so were not the typical patient in whom KD is considered in the differential diagnosis, and only 3 patients had scarlet fever, which would be more typically associated in the differential diagnosis of KD. Earlier studies have described similarities in gene expression profiles between bacterial infections and various autoimmune processes [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], likely reflecting downstream inflammatory cascades that are shared between these conditions.</p><p>Kawasaki disease is a dynamic process reflecting acute and subacute stages and our patients were enrolled at varying days of fever. Increasing days of fever at the time of the sample collection was inversely correlated with the MDTH score. Further investigation with a substantial number of patients treated later in the course of KD illness will be extremely important, as these children may no longer exhibit the biosignature observed in children diagnosed earlier. Thus, we believe that duration of fever is likely a crucial factor to consider when interpreting host expression data, and we accounted for such factor when we conducted our multivariable models.</p><p>Japanese clinical scoring systems have been successful in identifying high-risk patients to facilitate use of adjuvant therapies such as corticosteroids for primary treatment of KD, which have been associated with decrease coronary artery aneurism development in these children [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Those scoring systems have not been validated in ethnically diverse non-Japanese populations [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Identification of potential non-responders before IVIG treatment using genomic scores (MDTH) in an ethnically diverse population may potentially allow early use of adjunctive therapies in selected patients, which in turn could be associated with improved coronary outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Previous studies have utilized whole blood transcriptional patterns to identify specific transcripts that were over-expressed in patients with eventual IVIG resistance [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as well as serum biomarkers and cytokines such as G-CSF and sTNFR1 that were correlated with lack of response to therapy. [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We utilized a slightly different approach with the MDTH score, and instead of focusing on a specific marker, we evaluated the overall molecular perturbation in KD patients in relation to the healthy control baseline. The MDTH scores from KD patients before IVIG treatment were significantly higher in children who were eventually IVIG resistant. Furthermore, among the laboratory variables evaluated, only high MDTH scores independently and incrementally predicted lack of response to therapy.</p><p>Our study has limitations. Because the limited number of patients with coronary abnormalities in our cohort, we were unable to identify any correlation between pre-treatment MDTH scores and development of coronary abnormalities (CAA). Profiles were derived from peripheral whole blood and may not reflect the pathophysiology of arterial damage, the most relevant site of inflammation in KD. On the other hand, KD is a systemic process and this type of analytical strategy has been used successfully to identify biomarkers and characterize the immunopathogenesis of other childhood vasculitides [<xref rid="pone.0197858.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197858.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this study provides further evidence of the marked dysregulation of the systemic inflammatory response induced by KD disease and confirms the value of transcriptional profiling as a promising strategy to determine eventual lack of response to IVIG, after adjusting for other variables in this cohort. As new and potentially more rapid technologies become available, transcriptional profiling in the clinical setting has the potential for use to improve the risk stratification of KD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197858.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>10 classifier genes that best discriminated between Kawasaki disease and Group A streptococcus infection and the 25 classifier genes that best discriminated between Kawasaki disease and adenovirus infection.</title><p>The systematic, common and genebank names are included in the first three columns.
