<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The alarmingly rapid emergence of highly drug-resistant strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) has given traction to therapeutic approaches that target host cellular processes rather than the pathogen itself. Investigations of these so-called host-directed therapies have largely focused on modulating the function of the macrophage to Mtb infection, given that this innate immune player is a principal host cell involved in the immunological response to tuberculosis (TB).</p><p>The receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) family comprises seven members whose defining feature is a homologous serine/threonine kinase domain, but which differ widely in terms of functional domains (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As their name implies, the RIPK proteins play fundamental roles in the response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli and have emerged as critical regulators of inflammatory and cell death signaling pathways, leading to intense interest in pharmacologically targeting these proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although the functions of RIPK4-7 are poorly understood, RIPK2 is known to be required for signaling following detection of bacterial peptidoglycan derivatives by the NOD2 cytosolic receptor (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Studies of RIPK1 have elucidated its pivotal role in dictating the outcome of death receptor signaling, in terms of whether a cell triggers pro-inflammatory gene expression or engages the apoptotic cell death pathway. However, RIPK1 also interacts with RIPK3, the best characterized role of which is the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)&#x02014;a dedicated pseudokinase that is essential for the execution of a regulated necrotic form of cell death, termed necroptosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>We recently demonstrated that Mtb-infected human and mouse macrophages do not undergo necroptosis and that this form of cell death does not contribute to Mtb disease pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, phenotypic differences between <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Mlkl<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (both of which are unable to engage necroptosis) in numerous disease models have made it clear that RIPK3 participates in additional pathways beyond inducing necroptosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Several reports have now described MLKL-independent roles of RIPK3 in pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages and dendritic cells, including NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; maturation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and more recently, the production of type I IFN (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Such pathways reportedly contribute to protection against certain infections such as influenza A virus, with <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice experiencing a heightened susceptibility to infection due to an inability of macrophages to produce type I IFN in the lungs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The cell death-independent functions of RIPK3 have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases. For example, <italic>Ripk3</italic> deletion was found to attenuate disease in mouse models of kidney ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, and systemic inflammation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). RIPK3-dependent inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion by macrophages were also shown to be responsible for retinal detachment-induced photoreceptor death (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Type I IFNs are generally associated with TB disease progression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Although IL-1&#x003b2; is essential for the control of Mtb (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and the NLRP3 inflammasome appears to be dispensable for its production (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), individuals carrying a polymorphism in the <italic>IL1B</italic> promoter region that increases IL-1&#x003b2; expression are more susceptible to severe active TB disease with extrapulmonary lesions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Intriguingly, two groups recently reported that RIPK3 promotes necrosis of Mtb-infected macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> by stimulating the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), <italic>via</italic> a pathway requiring the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These experiments, which largely used RNAi and human and immortalized murine macrophages, were complemented with <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, in which <italic>Ripk3</italic>-deficient mice were shown to harbor fewer bacteria in the lungs following high-dose intravenous Mtb infection, although this was substantially less striking when mice were infected by low-dose aerosol (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The authors concluded that RIPK3 signaling is thus pathogenic during Mtb infection by promoting the escape of mycobacteria from necrotic macrophages and facilitating dissemination, leading to worse disease outcomes.</p><p>Reports that RIPK3-dependent inflammatory signaling by macrophages is pathological in many infectious and non-infections disease models, and recent work concluding that RIPK3 mediates a necrotic macrophage death modality, have emphasized the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting this host protein for the treatment of TB. The development of small molecule inhibitors of RIPK3 is being aggressively pursued (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) with several such compounds undergoing testing in preclinical models of disease. It is therefore of utmost importance to clearly define the involvement of RIPK3 in the pathogenesis of Mtb infection. Our previous work demonstrating that the MLKL-dependent necroptosis does not contribute to Mtb disease has enabled us to specifically examine the non-necroptotic functions of RIPK3 by using mice genetically targeted for this gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research Animal Ethics Committee reviewed and approved all animal experiments.

However, our data challenge this notion and show convincingly that targeting host RIPK3 does not represent a viable therapeutic option for Mtb infection.</p><p>Using a low-dose aerosol model of Mtb infection of mice, which mimics the natural acquisition of this pathogen by humans, we showed that the loss of <italic>Ripk3</italic> did not fundamentally alter disease outcomes in Mtb-infected mice. Our results were somewhat surprising in light of recent reports suggesting that RIPK3 signaling is pathogenic during Mtb infection due to its induction of a necrotic form of macrophage death, which promotes bacterial dissemination (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The authors described a 0.5 log decrease in bacterial numbers in the lungs of <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice 4&#x02009;weeks post-infection, in a high-dose intravenous challenge model (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). It is unclear, however, whether this phenotype persisted at later time points. Interestingly, when a more physiological low-dose aerosol infection model was used, akin to that in the present study, the difference appeared much less marked, more closely reflecting our results. The discrepancy between the intravenous and aerosol models, in terms of the robustness of the difference in bacterial numbers, is intriguing and may reflect the consequences of systemic immune activation arising from intravenous exposure to high doses of Mtb, which may be mitigated to a degree by <italic>Ripk3</italic> deletion. Macrophage necrosis induced by RIPK3 was postulated to require the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This could represent an attractive therapeutic target, since several compounds that inhibit this protein are in clinical or pre-clinical trials (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, perhaps not surprisingly, given the absence of a phenotype in <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, we found that neither the conditional deletion of <italic>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> in myeloid cells nor the pharmacologic inhibition of BCL-XL after infection imparted any benefit to mice in terms of reduced bacterial burden. Overall, our data do not support a role for <italic>Ripk3</italic> in mediating macrophage death, <italic>via</italic> necrosis or other forms of cell death. <italic>Ripk3</italic> deficiency did not protect mouse macrophages from dying following Mtb infection <italic>in vitro</italic>, and we observed no difference in macrophage numbers in the lungs or spleens of infected WT and <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Previous studies addressing RIPK3 function during Mtb infection used either <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDMs (as we have done) or RNAi knockdown of immortalized mouse macrophages (J774A.1) or human monocyte-derived macrophages, all of which were reportedly protected to varying degrees from Mtb-induced death by the loss of RIPK3 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The source of this discrepancy between our work and these previous studies is unclear. A possible explanation is species differences between human and mouse cells, but this seems unlikely given that one of these studies showed the same phenotype in human macrophages as in mouse BMDMs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although the time point for death analysis was consistent (48&#x02009;h for mouse macrophages), different MOIs (and potentially means of determining MOI) and methods of quantitating cell death were used, and one study used a different strain of Mtb (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Nonetheless, we examined death at several MOIs that covered the range used in these previous studies, as well as a validated and sensitive assay for cell death. Zhao et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) correlated the reduced necrotic death of RIPK3-deficient cells with lower intracellular Mtb growth after several days of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Our work showed that RIPK3 did not impact the ability of BMDMs to phagocytose Mtb upon initial exposure. We also assessed intracellular replication of Mtb, but to take into account the totality of factors that impact on bacterial replication <italic>in vivo</italic> (including other immune cells and cytokines), we performed this analysis on macrophages isolated from the BAL of infected mice. However, we found no difference between genotypes. This is consistent with the absence of any change in the expression of iNOS in <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, which has been shown to be a major factor restricting Mtb growth in mice (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This would suggest that any difference in intracellular bacterial numbers <italic>in vitro</italic> does not translate to infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. This prior study also reported that RIPK3 promotes ROS production by macrophages, and this was essential to the proposed mechanism for RIPK3-mediated necrosis. We did not examine ROS production as we observed no disparities in cell death or intracellular Mtb burdens between WT and <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages, nor any difference in disease outcomes between these genotypes of mice. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data, which defines the overall response in the context of all contributors to disease pathogenesis, would suggest that any differences in ROS generation between these two genotypes are mitigated on both a cellular and organism level, such that they do not impact overall disease outcomes.</p><p>Although most disease models have identified RIPK3 as a mediator of pathological inflammation, others, including models of influenza A and West Nile virus infection, have highlighted situations in which RIPK3 signaling in fact promotes immunity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Indeed, we noted a very marginal increase in bacterial numbers and inflammation 4&#x02009;weeks post-infection with Mtb in mice lacking RIPK3. However, this difference appeared to be transient and was not observed at any other time point, including later stages of infection. Mice begin to control Mtb replication around 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;weeks post-infection, coinciding with the development of adaptive immunity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We speculate that RIPK3 may thus play a small, transient role in regulating protective immunity during the handover between the early innate and the adaptive phases of the immune response. Nevertheless, the increase in bacterial number in <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was not borne out of any defect in IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF production in the lungs. The secretion of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#x003b2; by macrophages and dendritic cells can be induced by RIPK3 under certain conditions, with <italic>Ripk3</italic> deletion attenuating inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; processing following LPS stimulation or infection with certain RNA viruses (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, we did not observe any defect in IL-1&#x003b2; production by <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages infected with Mtb, consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> data. This may be due to the fact that the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins restrict inflammasome activation by RIPK3 and must themselves be inhibited/deleted to liberate this aspect of RIPK3 signaling (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It is thus unclear why <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice had a mild and transient impairment in Mtb control at 4&#x02009;weeks post-infection. However, RIPK3 interacts with other signaling molecules including RIPK1, and this interaction has been shown to regulate multiple signaling pathways such as ERK, cFos, and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and potentially JNK (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), leading to changes in inflammatory responses. In fact, RIPK3 has been implicated in the production of several cytokines in addition to IL-1&#x003b2; during host responses to pathogens, including type I IFN (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and chemokines (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), from immune and non-immune cell types, respectively. We hypothesize that perhaps deficiencies in such cytokines in <italic>Ripk3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice at the critical interphase between innate and adaptive immunity may have conspired to produce the observed phenotype.</p><p>Collectively, our findings indicate that in the context of Mtb infection, RIPK3 does not play a fundamental role in regulating inflammatory responses or necrotic macrophage death <italic>in vivo</italic>, at least not in a non-redundant capacity. We would, therefore, argue against the pursuit of RIPK3 inhibition as a tractable therapeutic option for TB.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research Animal Ethics Committee reviewed and approved all animal experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MS, SO, and MP conceived and designed the research.
