<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of global mortality from an infectious disease. In 2016, there were 10.4 million incident and 6.3 million new cases of TB disease and 1.67 million deaths, and its diagnosis is problematic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Active pulmonary TB diagnosis requires culture of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, which may take up to 6 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although the World Health Organisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> endorsed GeneXpert MTB/RIF automated molecular test for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> results in rapid diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, this test still requires sputum, which can be difficult to obtain. Difficulties in obtaining sputum lead to ~30% of patients in the USA and 50% of South African patients to be treated empirically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, clinical disease represents one end of a spectrum of infection states. An estimated one third of all individuals worldwide have been infected with the causative pathogen, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but the vast majority remain clinically asymptomatic with no radiological or microbiological evidence for active infection. This state is termed as latent TB infection (LTBI) and conceptually denotes that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> persists within its host, while maintaining its&#x000a0;viability with the potential to replicate and cause symptomatic disease. Indeed, LTBI represents the primary reservoir for future incident TB, with 90% of all TB cases estimated to arise from reactivation of existing infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The risk of incident TB arising from existing LTBI is heterogeneous, poorly characterised and modifiable with anti-tuberculous treatment. Modelling studies indicate that effective TB prevention to reduce future TB incidence requires policies directed at the identification and treatment of LTBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, implementation of mass screening programmes for this purpose are severely constrained by the size of the target population. Transformative advances in diagnostic tools that can effectively help to stratify TB risk in the LTBI population are therefore implicit to the realisation of systematic screening.</p><p id="Par4">The basis for LTBI heterogeneity rests with the limited scope of the tools we have available to identify the state. LTBI is inferred solely through evidence that immune sensitisation has occurred, by the tuberculin skin test (TST) or the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) release assay (IGRA). Although these tests are both sensitive and specific for identifying the exposure, that has been associated with establishment of an adaptive immune response, neither distinguishes active from latent infection. Moreover, T-cell responses to mycobacterial antigens persist for several years after the infection has been treated, implying that these tests may not reliably inform the presence of viable organisms in vivo. For &#x02018;true&#x02019; LTBI, in which the pathogen remains viable, it is envisaged that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the host immune response and the pathogen, with a shifting balance in favour of one or the other, influencing the future risk of TB reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A study using highly sensitive radiological imaging with combined Positron Emission Tomography and Computerised Tomography has reported evidence to support this dynamic state and demonstrated phenotypic imaging characteristics associated with the risk of developing TB among subjects with conventionally defined LTBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A proportion of these LTBI patients were identified with radiological features of subclinical active TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, with a subgroup failing to respond to prophylactic LTBI treatment regimens. These observations support the view that injudicious use of LTBI chemoprophylaxis using presently available diagnostic tools for mass screening risks, promotes drug resistance in unrecognised active infection.</p><p id="Par5">We have previously characterised an interferon (IFN)-inducible transcriptional signature of 393 gene transcripts in whole blood that discriminates patients with active pulmonary TB (from high- and low-incidence TB-burden countries) from healthy individuals, patients with other chronic respiratory and systemic conditions, and the majority of patients with LTBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This TB signature revealed an unexpected dominance of type I IFN-inducible genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> more frequently associated with viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> have since shown that elevated and sustained levels of type I IFN result in an enhanced mycobacterial load and disease exacerbation in experimental models of TB. Similar findings of a blood signature in active TB patients have since been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and our meta-analysis of 16 datasets, including many of these studies, identified 380 genes differentially abundant in active TB across all datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, there is a relative lack of concordance across studies that have reported a reduced and optimised diagnostic gene signature, although an agreement exists for some of the pathways they represent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. While some genes overlap between the different reduced signatures, the overall composition of each reduced signature is unique, both in size and transcript profile. In this respect, we note that a consistent statistical approach to optimising gene selection has not been used across studies, and where the approach was consistent, a different optimal reduced signature was reported for discriminating active TB from either LTBI and controls or other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, recent reports suggest that these signatures do not effectively discriminate TB from other diseases such as pneumonia, lowering their value as stand-alone diagnostic tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We have previously observed and reported that 10&#x02013;20% of subjects with IGRA positive LTBI in our studies had a transcriptional signature that overlapped with active TB patients and clustered with this group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. By definition, the transcriptional signature in this LTBI outlier group shares important similarities with the signature of active TB that requires further characterisation. Importantly, the biological significance of this statistical observation remains unclear. However, these observations support the utilisation of a transcriptional approach to explore the LTBI heterogeneity. In keeping with this, Zak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> have recently reported evidence for a gene signature of TB several months in advance of clinical presentation with disease, among a cohort of South African adolescents, contained within the previously described TB signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This suggests that transcriptional signatures of TB in subjects with presumed LTBI may indicate either a high risk of progression to active disease or existing subclinical disease. However, the interpretation of the study was limited by the confounding risk of new TB exposure in a high TB incidence setting, particularly to determine the longitudinal changes in signature expression and dynamic heterogeneity of the host immune response. Analysis focussed on the subgroup with IGRA defined LTBI, despite a proportion of prospective TB cases developing in subjects that were IGRA negative at baseline, suggesting either new TB exposure during prospective observation in a high TB incidence setting and/or that the IGRA test did not reliably inform the underlying LTBI. In this context, studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of IGRAs in microbiologically confirmed active TB report an overall sensitivity of ~85%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, implying that a proportion of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections may be missed using this test alone.</p><p id="Par7">To address some of these questions, here we (i) validate the microarray findings by RNA-sequencing in our published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> cohorts and a new cohort of TB; (ii) evaluate current TB gene signatures from the literature against TB and other infections; (iii) develop and test a modular TB signature in multiple TB cohorts and other diseases; (iv) develop a reduced TB-specific gene signature from modules of TB and test against viral infections and other diseases; (v) evaluate the transcriptional profile of LTBI outliers and compare with active TB; (vi) evaluate the blood transcriptional signature at baseline and longitudinally in TB contacts who develop TB against those TB contacts who remain healthy, in a low TB incidence setting (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). As a proof of principle, our reduced TB-specific gene set developed from the modular signature not only distinguishes active TB and LTBI, but additionally does not detect viral and bacterial infections. We identify immunological heterogeneity of LTBI, with a percentage of individuals showing a transcriptional signature of active TB, which only develop longitudinally in a small proportion of the recent close contacts of TB.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The objectives of this study.

A 373-gene signature was then independently re-derived from the Berry London RNA-seq data (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>; Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and validated in the Berry South Africa cohort (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and a new Leicester cohort (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Consistent with our previous microarray signature, the RNA-seq signature was absent in the majority of individuals with LTBI and healthy controls, and identified with perfect agreement the LTBI subjects that cluster with active TB, henceforth referred to as LTBI outliers in both Berry cohorts (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>b and d).

Although non-selective and lacking subjective bias, this approach favours the selection of a highly correlated gene set with a narrow immunological focus. In this context, limited diversity risks the loss of specificity, with an increased likelihood of overlap between multiple pathologies and responses to different infections for a specific immune pathway. We therefore hypothesised that methodologies that incorporate information from the entire transcriptome may better inform the development of a unique biosignature for TB. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (WGCNA) is a well-validated clustering technique for reducing high dimensional data into modules that preserve intrinsic relationships between variables within a network structure. When applied to the blood transcriptome, modules of co-ordinately expressed genes with a coherent functional relationship are generated. The complete transcriptome is thus expressed as a signature defined by the relative perturbation of individual modules.</p><p id="Par12">We applied WGCNA analysis to the blood transcriptional data from our Berry and Leicester TB cohorts, those TB cohorts published by Zak and Kaforou<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and to several others that included sample sets of other viral and bacterial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, together with our previous cohorts of sarcoidosis and lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> as conditions that may mimic TB, all compared against their healthy controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> (information of published cohorts), Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref> (genes in each module) and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> (module annotation)<bold>)</bold>. The modular signature for active TB was qualitatively consistent across all the TB cohorts and absent in LTBI. The IFN modules (light green and yellow) were overabundant in TB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), as we have previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and also in acute influenza infection, but absent in bacterial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). However, we observed clear differences between TB and both influenza and other bacterial infections in the pattern of specific perturbation of other modules including underabundance of gene expression in the T-cell (blue and cyan) and B-cell (midnight blue) modules (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) for TB.

Similarly, other genes were specifically expressed in influenza. Thus, although modular expression of the yellow module is comparable between TB and influenza, gene subsets within the module exhibit differential expression between the two conditions. This provides scope to select genes from this dominant module that can be used to develop a TB signature, while retaining discriminant value from viral infection. Using this rationale as a proof of principle, we identified and extracted 303 unique gene candidates in the Berry London TB dataset that were selectively perturbed in TB, but not in any confounding viral infections, from all modules that contributed to and exhibited consistency across the TB datasets that we analysed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>; Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>).

Our 20-gene signature (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) included genes from six different modules (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6d</xref>), representing both overabundance and underabundance in TB. Using a modified Disease Risk Score (See Methods), we identified the powerful discrimination between active TB and LTBI/controls in Berry London and South Africa, and Leicester cohorts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). In contrast, the signature identified no difference between influenza and the controls or between bacterial pneumonia and the controls at any time point across 5 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Our 20-gene signature also discriminated active TB from LTBI and the controls, in three additional published cohorts, similarly to the 44-gene signature described by Kaforou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).

To compare and contrast the signature of this group with active TB and the majority of LTBI resembling healthy controls (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>d and e), we specifically examined the WGCNA modular signature in the LTBI outliers using the combined Berry London and South Africa datasets and Leicester dataset, respectively, compared with healthy controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>).

This is a group in which recent exposure to active TB is documented, placing them at higher risk of recently acquired infection. Our rationale for this approach was to evaluate whether blood transcriptional data would identify LTBI that is not detected using IGRA. The observations that: firstly, the Leicester control group had greater overlap in the enrichment scores with the IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> LTBI group using the Zak and Kaforou signatures, compared with the Berry London cohort <bold>(</bold>Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref><bold>)</bold>; and secondly, one subject from this group was identified as an outlier, together suggest that IGRA testing alone would miss some <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We therefore elected to define our TB contacts henceforth as IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> or IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup>, with no deterministic reference to LTBI.</p><p id="Par18">The modular signatures of both IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup> and IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> contacts qualitatively demonstrated considerable between-subject heterogeneity and some within-subject variability; a comparison between the groups suggested more transcriptional activity, in the form of a higher frequency and greater breadth of modules exhibiting overabundance and underabundance within the IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> group (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). For the cohort that developed TB after recruitment to the study (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), we stratified subjects on the basis of their longitudinal clinical course as true progressors (no evidence of TB at baseline, with features developing during observation); subclinical TB (objective evidence of pathology, usually as radiological change, in the absence of reported symptoms); and active TB (symptoms at baseline with either radiological or microbiological evidence for TB subsequently identified) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This stratification was performed to better understand the dynamic relationship between the modular signature and the onset of TB.</p><p id="Par19">To quantitatively evaluate the modular signatures in each group for their proximity to TB, we applied the modified disease risk score for our 20-gene signature (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>).

Longitudinal observations suggest relative stability of the risk score in the majority of both IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> and IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup> subjects that were examined. In contrast, six of the nine subjects that were diagnosed with TB demonstrated high baseline modified disease risk scores that tended to increase further, prior to diagnosis of active TB. In the other three contacts (subjects 245, 348 and 278), the modified disease risk score remained low at all time points, before and at the time of TB diagnosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Baseline scores demonstrated clustering near the baseline for IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup> subjects (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>). In contrast, both the IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> group and the group that developed TB exhibited a higher risk score (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>; Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

However, some discordance between the clustering outcomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and the TB score was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>), with two subjects that were not outliers having TB scores within the outlier range (subjects 185 and 040). Furthermore, the IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup> subject categorised as an outlier (subject 209) had a very low TB score (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>). Overall, the longitudinal within-subject expression of the 20-gene TB signature in both the IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> and IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> cohorts could be categorised into the following three groups: (i) subjects that did not express the signature at any time point (10 of the 15 IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> subjects and 6 of the&#x000a0;16 IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> subjects); (ii) subjects that transiently expressed the signature, albeit generally to a low extent, in the first 3&#x02013;4 months (4 of the 15 IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> subjects and 8 of the 16 IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> subjects; (iii) subjects that already had or developed a persistent TB signature at and beyond 4 months (1 of the 15 IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> subjects and 2 of the 16 IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> subjects) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>).

For the remaining three subjects (subjects 245, 278 and 348), a 20-gene signature of TB was not expressed. For subject 245, an explanation may be that this patient received antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia, which are known to have immunosuppressive effects that may have affected expression of the immune signature. For subjects 278 and 348, we have not identified the potential confounding factors for this observation.

We show that an advanced modular approach, rather than a traditionally derived reduced gene set, is robust in discriminating active TB patients from individuals with LTBI, whilst additionally not detecting acute viral and bacterial infections. Our findings highlight the need to consider additional approaches to develop transcriptional biomarkers of the highest sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing active TB from LTBI and other diseases.

In this study, we repeated the analysis of our previous Berry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> cohorts using RNA-seq and provided reassurance that RNA-seq recapitulates the outcomes derived using microarray. The vast majority of genes in our RNA-seq derived 373-gene signature also comprised our original 393-gene transcript signature. Furthermore, there was equivalence in allocation of subjects to clusters, including those with LTBI that clustered with active TB and thus referred to as outliers. This is of considerable translational significance, as no field applicable test is likely to be based on RNA-seq or microarray analysis.</p><p id="Par24">In transcriptomic studies of the disease, there has been focus on deriving reduced gene signatures to develop clinical diagnostics, with inconsistencies in both deriving and defining the optimal reduced gene signature.

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of some of the published reduced gene signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> on our independent TB cohorts and confirmed excellent specificity and sensitivity to distinguish active TB patients from those with LTBI. However, we identified dominance of IFN-inducible genes in these signatures and demonstrated the enrichment of these signatures in published datasets of acute influenza infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which represents the immune response globally observed in viral infections. However, these signatures was not apparent in bacterial pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, highlighting the apparent lack of IFN-inducible genes in the immunological response to bacterial pneumonia. However, it is clear that the immune response in TB has a dominant IFN-inducible gene signature resembling that of viral infections. It follows that such IFN-inducible signatures, whilst optimised for discriminating active TB patients and healthy individuals, with and without LTBI, with high sensitivity, may also detect other pathologies and/or infectious diseases that may exhibit a similar clinical presentation. It is clear that IFN-inducible genes are dominant discriminators of active TB from healthy LTBI, leading to preferential selection of this gene set to define an optimal signature. However, this dominance precludes consideration of most other gene sets and may also detect other diseases, such as viral infections. This view is supported by the differences in the reported signatures of Kaforou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> that were independently derived to discriminate active TB from LTBI or active TB from other diseases. The 44-gene signature, derived using the latter approach, included more genes and exhibited greater diversity when compared with the 27-gene signature for discriminating LTBI from TB. However, both signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> in addition to others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> still showed high specificity and sensitivity for influenza. These observations suggest that a trade-off exists between these two objectives, of achieving high sensitivity and high specificity, and that a single signature may not be optimal for both. The development of biomarkers for clinical practice is defined and optimised according to the clinical context for use. In the clinical context, the two objectives of a TB signature fulfil the distinct requirements. A signature that discriminates active TB from LTBI is a useful screening tool for testing in healthy populations. Identification of an active TB signature when screening for LTBI can inform the need for further investigation. In contrast, a signature that discriminates active TB from other diseases would be applied for the investigation of unwell patients presenting with symptoms that suggest the possibility of TB, but may also be other infections including viral infections. While discrimination of TB from LTBI in screening programmes and TB from other diseases in patients that are unwell represent distinct clinical settings, the potential requirement of two different biomarkers adds complexity to the models of implementation, particularly in a field setting. Furthermore, there is overlap between screening and clinical diagnostics as people attending for screening may present with an intercurrent illness (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) that is unrelated to TB. A single biomarker that is able to achieve reliable discrimination of TB from both LTBI and other conditions will have greater utility in clinical practice. A trade-off in sensitivity to distinguish active TB from LTBI may result from losing the IFN-inducible genes that are highly induced by viral infections. However, it is possible that this knowledge will allow the retention of such genes that distinguish active TB from LTBI with high sensitivity, by also including additional genes that are detected in response to viral infections and not TB, as an additional discriminatory approach to maintaining high sensitivity and specificity for TB against LTBI.</p><p id="Par25">We developed the WGCNA-derived modular signature for active TB across our cohorts and determined consistency of the signature in our cohorts and those from other published datasets. When all 23 modules were taken into consideration, the signature in active TB was distinct from both viral and bacterial infections. In keeping with our earlier findings of an IFN-inducible signature of active TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we here also demonstrate an IFN-inducible gene signature in both the active TB and LTBI outliers. The IFN-inducible signature, however, is now distributed across the three different modules; two overabundant modules; the yellow module that includes <italic>BATF2, AIM2, FCGR1A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, and a number of <italic>GBPs</italic>; the light green module, which we show is also strongly overabundant in influenza infection, includes many <italic>IFITs, ISGs</italic> and <italic>OASs</italic>, and very reminiscent of type-I IFN-inducible genes induced during viral infections. In contrast, the Tan module, which includes <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>TBX21</italic>, is significantly underabundant in TB and some LTBI outliers, in keeping with the reported downregulation of <italic>IFNG</italic> expression and signalling by high levels of type I IFN, contributing to the pathogenesis of TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This could also represent the reduced number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that we observe in the blood of active TB patients, as we have previously discussed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We also observed that this IFNG module was underabundant in those contacts who progressed to TB (7 out of 9), whereas few of the IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> (3 out of 16) and IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> (2 out of 15) showed an underabundance of this module. This supports the hypothesis that the ratio of type I IFN versus IFNG-inducible genes may be critical in determining protection or progression to TB disease.</p><p id="Par26">To tackle the challenge of developing a high performing TB signature, we explored the modular tool for systematic gene reduction into biologically meaningful modules that together represent the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we additionally identified the gene clusters that were differentially expressed in TB, but not influenza, from within the modules of IFN signalling. This was an important observation as the opportunity to select specific genes from these dominant modules offered scope to improve the specificity of the signature and discrimination of TB from LTBI and other diseases. Based on these findings, we developed and evaluated a two-step approach for the targeted gene selection to derive a TB signature. Modules perturbed in TB were first interrogated to establish a gene set comprising genes that are differentially expressed in TB, compared with other diseases. A priori gene selection in this way provided a gene set with high TB specificity against other diseases. In the second step, traditional gene reduction methodology was applied to separate TB from LTBI using this gene set. As a proof of principle, we developed a 20-gene signature using this approach that was diverse in its modular representation, incorporating the genes from six modules. We demonstrate here that this 20-gene signature has robust sensitivity and specificity for discriminating active TB from LTBI in our cohorts, in addition to across a number of different published cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our 20-gene signature also showed discrimination of TB from other diseases, similarly to the 44-gene signature of Kaforou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, our 20-gene signature did not detect influenza from healthy controls, in contrast to all the other reported TB signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which not only detected TB at high specificity and sensitivity against LTBI, but additionally showed a high specificity and sensitivity for influenza versus the controls. Therefore, the development of our 20-gene signature provides a novel approach to discriminate TB from LTBI, whilst not detecting viral infections, here exemplified by influenza, offering scope for further refinement in further translational clinical studies.</p><p id="Par27">Heterogeneity of LTBI was suggested in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> with the identification of an outlier group after clustering. In the present study, we identified a similar proportion of LTBI outliers in the new Leicester cohort. We demonstrated the enrichment scores using the published signatures of Zak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and Kaforou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, dominated by IFN-inducible genes that were higher in the outliers compared with other LTBI in both the Berry and Leicester cohorts, and overlapped with scores obtained in active TB. These observations suggested that LTBI outliers are characterised by an overabundance of IFN-inducible genes, a view that was corroborated in their modular signatures, together with identification of 70 selectively upregulated genes common to both the Berry and Leicester LTBI outliers, which mapped to IFN signalling pathways. The clinical significance of these observations remains unclear, however the recent study of Zak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> suggests that the expression of a TB-like signature, characterised by enrichment of IFN-inducible genes, which we show from our analysis, may indicate either subclinical disease or increased risk of progression to TB within a few months, although this may be confounded by viral infections.</p><p id="Par28">We utilised the modular signature for deeper characterisation of heterogeneity in recent TB contacts and identified instances of similarity with TB in a few of the IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> (2) and IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> (4) individuals, representing IFN and other signalling pathways. There were higher perturbations in the modular signature in IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> individuals. Our observations of low modular activity for the IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> cohort is consistent with the absence of LTBI and likely to reflect a robust finding. In contrast, the enrichment scores of the published signatures we tested indicated considerably more overlap of IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup> subjects with the IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> group, again suggesting impaired specificity of these signatures. Other modular changes, discordant with TB, appeared to be driven by differences in the pattern of perturbation in&#x000a0;other modules than those representing IFN signalling pathways. The majority of contacts who developed TB had a modular signature (six out of nine) comparable to that of active TB patients, observable before a diagnosis was made.</p><p id="Par29">In keeping with the global modular activity, we observed evidence of dynamic change in the reduced 20-gene signature, derived from the modules, of some TB contacts that can be categorised into three patterns of longitudinal expression that may reflect early immunological events following TB exposure. We suggest that the absence of a signature at any time point may indicate the absence of infection being acquired. This pattern was seen in 67% of our IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> cohort and 38% of our IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> cohort. A transient signature may indicate an infection that was acquired, but has either been controlled or cleared. In this context, the observation that 26% of our IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> cohort and 50% of our IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> cohort demonstrated this pattern suggests that the blood transcriptional signature represents immune responses that may precede priming and activation of IFN-&#x003b3; producing CD4 T-cells. Finally, subjects with an evolving and persistent modular TB signature may represent subjects that have acquired an infection requiring active control to maintain latency. This pattern was seen in 7% of IGRA<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup> subjects and 12% of IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> subjects. These observations require validation in larger longitudinal cohorts, but do suggest that the blood transcriptome may offer a sensitive approach to characterising the state of latent infection following TB exposure, with implications for better stratification of prospective TB risk.</p><p id="Par30">For our cohort of nine subjects identified with TB during prospective observation, a high or rising 20-gene signature score was observed in most. This was most apparent in the subjects defined as true progressors who had no signature at baseline. Our study was limited by small numbers and the identification of TB within a short period of prospective observation, suggesting that incipient&#x000a0;(or subclinical) TB is likely to have been present at the time of baseline assessment in a proportion of cases. We are therefore presently unable to comment on the dynamic properties of this response or determine accurately the interval between the signature becoming detectable and manifestation of active TB. It is notable also that three subjects did not express a signature at any time point and yet went on to be diagnosed with TB. One of these was on anti-bacterial drugs, which have known immunosuppressive properties, which could have diminished the signature. Additionally, interrogating the modules for these subjects indicates a weak transcriptional response that may suggest pathogen-induced host immunomodulation, which is well recognised in active TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We are unable to determine whether a delayed transcriptional response would have developed over the natural timecourse of infection, as our rigorous protocol of frequent surveillance identified active disease at the earliest stage, however, it is apparent that heterogeneity of the host immune response and its association with the state of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> requires further investigation.</p><p id="Par31">A robust and objective definition of LTBI is unavailable. Patients with IGRA positivity have a heterogeneous risk of developing TB, and secondly, a proportion of patients that are IGRA<sup>-ve</sup> at screening proceed to develop TB in the future. It therefore follows that an IGRA is not a reliable gold standard to determine the validity of new biomarkers. In this respect, our observations of a TB-like modular signature being expressed in both IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> and IGRA<sup>-ve</sup> contacts of TB is not surprising. The difference between the groups in the proportion of subjects expressing the signature (19% in IGRA<sup>+ve</sup> vs. 7% in IGRA<sup>&#x02013;ve</sup>) is comparable with the relative risk of TB, according to the IGRA status (incident rate ratio for TB, 2.11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>). This provides support for the validity of our observations and supports developing a transcriptional biomarker for defining LTBI.</p><p id="Par32">Here in summary, we have validated the whole blood transcriptomic findings, previously identified by microarray by RNA-sequencing of our previously published TB cohorts and a new cohort from a low-TB-incidence setting. We further developed an advanced modular signature of active TB, and validated it in our new cohort and a number of TB cohorts published by other groups. Using this modular signature, we obtained a reduced TB-specific 20-gene signature that showed very high specificity and sensitivity in individuals with active TB against those with LTBI and other diseases. Moreover, this signature did not detect influenza, representative of many viral infections that share a strong IFN-inducible signature, providing a proof of principle for the development of transcriptional biomarkers for TB as diagnostics, with the aim of obtaining the highest sensitivity, whilst maintaining specificity against LTBI and other diseases. Our findings highlight the need to consider additional approaches to develop transcriptional biomarkers of the highest sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing active TB from LTBI and other diseases. The reduced gene signatures for discriminating active TB from LTBI and other infections also demonstrated important clinical outcomes and heterogeneity in LTBI. Our improved approach for the development of diagnostic biomarkers consisting of reduced gene sets is broadly applicable across diverse infectious and inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study cohorts for analysis</title><p id="Par33">Cohorts analysed in Berry et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> using microarrays were subjected to RNA-seq and analysed as part of this study.
