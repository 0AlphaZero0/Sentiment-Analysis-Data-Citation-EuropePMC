<sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by
<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (
<italic>Mtb</italic>) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Multidrug-resistant TB remains a public health crisis, and only one vaccine (the
<italic>M. bovis</italic>-derived Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin, BCG) is currently licensed for clinical use. To meet the sustainable development goal of ending the TB epidemic by 2030, new treatments and vaccines are both urgently needed.</p><p>BCG efficacy is highly variable
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The reasons why BCG protects when it does and why it fails when it doesn&#x02019;t are incompletely understood, but are crucial to the successful design and testing of new vaccines
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, to be able to accurately assess vaccine candidates in models where BCG both protects and does not protect very early on in the vaccine development pipeline would be highly advantageous and de-risk failure in later stage clinical trials. There is however a lack of a broad range of tools that can collectively predict with some confidence whether a vaccine will be protective.</p><p>One of the tools for very early testing of TB vaccine candidates is a mouse model. However, in order to obtain meaningful information, new vaccine candidates should be tested in models that are clinically relevant and reflect the breadth and heterogeneity of immune environments and varying BCG efficacy found in human populations. We propose that this could be achieved by back-translating observations from clinical studies, such as correlates of risk of TB disease, into animal models.</p><p>A number of correlates of risk of TB disease have recently been identified, including transcriptomic mRNA signatures in blood, T cell activation, and monocyte to lymphocyte (ML) ratio
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, while others are being investigated (reviewed in
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We have chosen the ML ratio to provide proof of principle that correlates of risk can be back-translated into the mouse to develop a model for vaccine testing that better reflects the populations most at risk of BCG failure.</p><p>In this study, we show that inbred, commercially available mouse strains have differing ML ratios, and that a high ML ratio is associated with lower BCG-mediated protection from experimental
<italic>Mtb</italic> challenge. We further suggest that lack of BCG dissemination and/or persistence in ML high mice impairs protection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal work was carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under a license granted by the UK Home Office (PPL 70/8043), and approved locally by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Body.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals and experiment design</title><p>The following mouse strains were used for the experiments reported here (abbreviated names used throughout the manuscript are given in brackets): A/JOlaHsd (A/J); DBA/2OlaHsd (DBA/2); C57BL/6JOlaHsd (C57Bl/6); 129S2/SvHsd (129S2). Female mice were acquired from Envigo UK at 5&#x02013;7 weeks of age. Animals were housed in specific pathogen-free individually vented cages with environmental enrichment (play tunnel and tapvei block), with 12 hours light / 12 hours dark cycles, at temperatures between 19&#x000b0; &#x02013; 23&#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 45 &#x02013; 65%. Mice were fed sterilized diet RM1 and filtered water ad libitum, and were allowed to acclimatize for at least 5 days before the start of any experimental procedure. Mice were allocated to cages as groups of 5 by technical staff not involved in experimental procedures or data analysis, and mice of the same strain were housed together. Each cage was allocated to a treatment in no particular order, but without formal randomisation. Animal welfare was assessed twice every day before and during the study.</p><p>Two independent experiments with separate primary outcomes were carried out to obtain the data described in this report. In Experiment 1, 5 na&#x000ef;ve mice of each strain (20 mice total) were culled by anaesthetic overdose, and cardiac blood, lungs and spleens were collected for determination of the ML ratio by flow cytometric analysis (see below for details). The primary outcome for this experiment was the ML ratio (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In Experiment 2, parallel groups of mice (n=5 per group) were BCG-immunised or left untreated. These were allocated at the start of the study to either an immunogenicity group (IFN&#x003b3; response and BCG dissemination; 10 mice per strain; 40 mice total;

Numerous factors have been discussed as contributors to this, such as population differences, different BCG strains, vaccination schedules, exposure to environmental mycobacteria, co-infections with viruses and/or parasites, and geographical location

<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. While BCG works in some populations and protects children from pulmonary and extra-pulmonary disease, new vaccines are urgently needed for the populations where BCG fails to protect, such as adolescents and adults in endemic areas
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The incomplete understanding of the mechanisms behind BCG failure, together with limited tools for early assessment of vaccine efficacy, are hampering the development of new vaccines. In order to allow early vaccine testing in a model that better represents the populations most at risk of TB disease, we have taken a correlate of risk observed in human studies and back-translated it into a mouse model. The monocyte to lymphocyte (ML) ratio is a non-specific marker of inflammation and has been shown to be associated with risk of TB disease in several populations, including pregnant HIV infected women, people starting anti-retroviral therapy, BCG vaccinated infants and latently
<italic>Mtb</italic> infected adolescents

<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Scriba
<italic>et al</italic>. show a cascade of inflammatory events as adolescents progress towards disease, which appears to start with increased Type I/II IFN signalling, followed by an increase in monocytes and a decrease in lymphocytes
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. An increased risk of TB disease in BCG vaccinated individuals with a high ML ratio indicates that BCG is failing in those populations.</p><p>In order to provide proof of principle that the ML ratio, and observations from human studies more generally, can be back-translated to develop more clinically relevant mouse models, we chose to use commercially available, genetically tractable inbred mouse strains. We could show that these have highly varying ML ratios in blood, spleen, and lung, and that these differences, particularly in the lung, were associated with varying BCG-mediated protection from
<italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Using mouse strains with genetically different backgrounds means that there are likely other confounding factors that could impact vaccine efficacy. This is exemplified by the DBA/2 mice, which are well protected despite having a relatively high ML ratio across all tissues. This could be due to the fact that they have a higher neutrophil frequency than some of the other strains (data not shown). Although confounding factors may be at play here, this would also be the case in a clinical setting since an altered ML ratio can have different underlying causes. An increased ML ratio is an indicator for inflammation, likely driven by monocytosis during inflammation. Some factors that are thought to influence BCG efficacy also drive inflammation, such as co-infection with viruses or parasites, malnutrition, or exposure to environmental mycobacteria. However, as manipulation of ML ratio
<italic>in vitro</italic> impacts on ability to control mycobacterial growth, it is likely that ML ratio itself is contributing to TB risk, independent of the factor driving inflammation
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. It is also possible that host genetic factors determine baseline inflammation and ML ratio
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. If this is the case in TB endemic populations, inbred mouse strains with naturally varying ML ratios may be a useful model for BCG vaccine variability.</p><p>There are genetic differences between the inbred mouse strains used in this study, some of which have been well described, while others are likely to be unknown. Among the most well described genetic factors is the mutation of the interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor alpha subunit gene in A/J mice, which leads to impaired IL-3 signalling and reduced proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells and their differentiation into myeloid precursors. This is likely to play a role in the low ML ratio observed in these mice
<sup><xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. A/J mice additionally carry a defect in the gene for Naip5, an intracellular pattern recognition receptor involved in control of proliferation of intracellular pathogens
<sup><xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. It may thus have an effect on BCG persistence and dissemination. C57Bl/6 mice carry a polymorphism in the
<italic>slc11a1</italic> (formerly
<italic>nramp1</italic>) gene, which has been shown to determine susceptibility or resistance to intravenous infection with BCG as defined by BCG load in the spleen
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. It does not seem to determine susceptibility to primary
<italic>Mtb</italic> infection in mice, and the effect on BCG efficacy is not well studied
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In addition, different inbred mouse strains carry different MHC haplotypes. For the strains used in this study, they are as follows: 129S2, H2
<sup>b</sup>; C57Bl/6, H2
<sup>b</sup>; A/J, H2
<sup>a</sup>; DBA/2, H2
<sup>d</sup>. Each one confers the ability to recognise a slightly different range of epitopes, although there is overlap. This may also impact BCG- mediated immunity.</p><p>It is currently unclear what the relative contributions are of genetic and environmental factors to a change in ML ratio
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Does a naturally high ML ratio in an individual make them more prone to TB disease, or do other factors including
<italic>Mtb</italic> itself drive up the ML ratio, causing BCG to fail? Does a naturally high ML ratio in an individual exacerbate an inflammatory response initiated by environmental factors? There is striking heterogeneity in the immune response to BCG in infants vaccinated at birth, including in the ML ratio and cytokine responses
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. This points towards an involvement of host factors, as the influence of environmental factors would be limited so early in life. On the other hand, Scriba
<italic>et al</italic>. observe increases in inflammation and ML ratio over time in adolescents as an individual progresses towards active TB disease and diagnosis
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This may point towards the pathogen itself as the cause of an altered immune environment.</p><p>Interestingly, we found a higher number of antigen-specific IFN&#x003b3;-producing splenocytes in unprotected 129S2 mice compared to protected A/J mice at the time of
<italic>Mtb</italic> challenge. This seemed counterintuitive at first, but is in line with recent findings showing that a sub-population of BCG-vaccinated infants with an increased ML ratio showed increased T cell-mediated cytokine production, and this was associated with increased risk of TB disease
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. High monocyte count and pro-inflammatory cytokines are indicators for inflammation. It is possible that BCG efficacy is impaired in inflammatory immune environments, which may be caused by a variety of factors, such as chronic viral infection, age, malnutrition, or prolonged contact with environmental mycobacteria, all factors thought to impact BCG efficacy. Ultimately, BCG is administered into host immune environments with a heterogeneity that is not fully characterised or understood, yet may have implications for its efficacy.</p><p>The exact mechanisms behind an altered BCG vaccine efficacy in a ML high immune environment are currently unknown. Our data indicate that impaired dissemination and/or persistence of BCG may play a role in initiating an effective local immune response. A study by Kaveh and colleagues has shown that BCG persists for up to 16 months in lymph nodes and spleen of Balb/c mice and that persistence of live bacilli contributes to optimal protection from
<italic>M. bovis</italic> challenge
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Direct investigation of this phenomenon in humans is not possible; there are however reports that indicate that BCG can disseminate and persist for years in a variety of organs in humans
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. It is therefore plausible that an immune environment that impairs survival of BCG also impairs vaccine efficacy, although we did not determine in this study whether the absence of live bacilli in lungs of 129S2 mice is due to lack of dissemination or lack of persistence.</p><p>The absolute numbers of BCG might be under-estimated in this study as we only enumerated bacilli that were readily growing on standard 7H11 agar plates. Use of PCR methods or culture with resuscitation promoting factors may increase yield and allow for detection of dormant bacilli and their contribution to protection
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><p>If impaired dissemination and/or persistence in certain immune environments is indeed reducing BCG vaccine efficacy, it is reasonable to assume that other live mycobacterial vaccines would have similar limitations. Variability in the ML ratio and more general heterogeneity in the host immune environment should thus be taken into account when designing new live TB vaccines or vaccines based on boosting BCG.</p><p>To circumvent potentially impaired dissemination of parenterally administered live vaccines, mucosal administration of live vaccines could be considered. Recent evidence shows that mucosal administration of BCG confers increased protection in animal models, for example by inducing homing of T cells into protected mucosal niches
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. This agrees with the notion that BCG needs to be present in the lungs to initiate a protective immune response in this organ. Furthermore, subunit vaccines should not show decreased efficacy in ML high immune environments if our hypothesis is correct. Both these possibilities will need careful investigation to shed light on the mechanisms behind BCG failure.</p><p>We did not investigate the phenotype of monocytes/macrophages or T cells in this study, although it is likely that this plays a role. In particular, inflammatory monocytes might lead to killing of BCG. It will be interesting in future to investigate this, as well as comparing the ML ratio and immune cell phenotypes before and after BCG vaccination in the different mouse strains and locations.</p><p>We found a significantly higher proportion of CD11b
<sup>int</sup> CD11c
<sup>+</sup> cells in the lungs of C57Bl/6 mice, which are likely to be enriched in alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, C57Bl/6 mice are also the strain least susceptible to Mtb infection without BCG vaccination. While the frequency of this population does not seem to be associated with BCG-mediated protection after subcutaneous administration of the vaccine, it could play a role after intranasal vaccination. Alveolar macrophages are located on the luminal side of the epithelium, therefore encountering antigens and pathogens taken up from environmental air. The monocyte/macrophage population included in our ML ratio on the other hand is likely to be of interstitial nature, residing on the basal side of the epithelium and encountering antigens from the blood stream.</p><p>While our data on the susceptibility of na&#x000ef;ve mouse strains to
<italic>Mtb</italic> infection agrees with other studies
<sup><xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, we found some discrepancies between the data presented here and previously published data on BCG-mediated protection. A study using DBA/2 mice has shown that these mice are not protected by s.c. administration of BCG, but control infection with
<italic>Mtb</italic> better when vaccinated i.n.
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> This is in contrast to our finding that DBA/2 mice are protected from
<italic>Mtb</italic> challenge after s.c. vaccination. However, there are some differences between these two studies that may explain the different findings: a different source of mice was used; protection was assessed at 8 weeks vs 6 weeks after vaccination; the BCG strain and
<italic>Mtb</italic> strain differed; and the
<italic>Mtb</italic> dose used for challenge was three times higher in the study by Aguilo and colleagues compared to ours. Another report detailing the susceptibility of different mouse strains to
<italic>Mtb</italic> challenge shows that A/J mice are notably less protected than C57Bl/6 mice
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, while in our hands the opposite is the case. There are important differences between the two studies, including the age and sex of mice used, the time point after vaccination at which protection was measured, and the use of different BCG and
<italic>Mtb</italic> strains. In combination, these factors may lead to a differing extent of protection. With particular relevance to this study, the immune cell frequency between male and female animals differs in A/J mice. For example, dataset Donahue5 on the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Phenome Database indicates a higher percentage of monocytes in blood for males compared to females, while T cells are less frequent in males, leading to a higher ML ratio in males
<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, the back-translation of a correlate of risk of TB disease, the ML ratio, into an animal model is a step forward for better tools to study the immune mechanisms behind BCG vaccine failure and to test vaccines in a model more relevant to populations most at risk. Hopefully other risk factors can also be back-translated in the future to obtain a more complete picture of vaccine efficacy at very early stages of testing. We would encourage the use of more diverse mouse models in TB vaccine testing and development to reflect the heterogeneity of immune environments found in human populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: &#x000a9; 2018 Zelmer A et al.</p><p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).
