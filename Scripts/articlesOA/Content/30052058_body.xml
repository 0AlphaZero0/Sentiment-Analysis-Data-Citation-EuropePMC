<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease with a history interwoven with the evolution and migration of human, as well as with the origins of microbiology. The main etiologic agent of TB is <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mtb infects 2&#x000a0;billion people around the world, causing nearly 10.4&#x000a0;million new active TB cases and 1.8&#x000a0;million deaths annually [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In TB pathogenesis, the host cellular immune response determines whether an infection becomes a latent TB infection or progresses to infectious active TB or extrapulmonary TB [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Approximately 90% of infected individuals will remain asymptomatic with latent TB infection. Only 10% of individuals infected with Mtb will develop active disease, suggesting that host immunity is important in regulating progression of TB infection [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>miRNAs, a type of noncoding RNA between 22 and 24 nucleotide (nt), could be important regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and influence many biological systems including mammalian immune systems [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies found that miRNAs extensively regulate cell differentiation, development and disease [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In mammals, over 60% of mRNAs are thought to be regulated by miRNAs [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Studies have found altered gene expression profiles in macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells from individuals with active or latent TB, and individuals with TB infection or healthy individuals. This alteration of cellular composition and related gene expression in patients with TB is likely regulated by miRNAs [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several miRNAs regulate T-cell differentiation and function in patients [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, miRNAs are important for regulating the innate function of macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some miRNAs in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are altered in latent and active TB [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Novel miRNA combinations can discriminate between individuals with a TB infection and healthy individuals [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the functions of miRNAs are closely correlated with pulmonary TB pathogenesis, their molecular regulatory mechanism has not been investigated by integrated mRNA and miRNA transcriptome analysis.</p><p>In this study, high-throughput sequencing strategy was employed to screen differentially expressed mRNA and miRNAs between individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and healthy individuals with DESeq analysis [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Potential target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using TargetScan [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and miRanda [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] algorithms. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) term and KEGG pathways for predicted and differentially expressed genes was conducted to get insights into the functions of mRNAs and miRNAs in PTB pathogenesis. These analyses will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the development and pathogenesis of PTB.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0001"><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="S0002"><title>Patients with PTB &#x00026; healthy individuals</title><p>PTB patients were diagnosed based on clinical manifestations, bacterial culture and radiographic findings.

They have emerged as novel regulators in various biological processes and pathogenic conditions such as inflammation, cancer and infectious diseases [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They are important gene regulatory factors in multicellular genomes. More than 50&#x02013;60% of cellular mRNAs are thought to be regulated by miRNAs. One miRNA can target multiple mRNAs, and in turn, one mRNA can be targeted by multiple miRNAs [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Understanding the complexity of the miRNA network in host&#x02013;pathogen interactions may open new avenues for identifying biomarkers and improving the efficacy of therapies against TB in humans.</p><p>Many miRNAs are altered in peripheral blood cells during active TB, identified by high-throughput sequencing. Numerous candidate miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for human TB [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although a large number of miRNAs have been identified in PTB, miRNA&#x02013;mRNA interactional regulatory mechanisms in the process of PTB are less reported. Screening comparing patients with PTB and healthy individuals (greater than or equal to twofold change; adjusted p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) identified 2565 mRNAs with significant levels of differential expression, with 1383 significantly upregulated and 1182 significantly downregulated. A series of immunity-related genes including leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, Fc fragment of IgG binding protein and BCL2-like 11 were obtained. Differential expression analysis revealed 41 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in patients with PTB versus healthy individuals (greater than or equal to twofold change; adjusted p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), including 18 upregulated miRNAs and 23 downregulated miRNAs. A series of important miRNAs included has-miR-150-3p, has-miR-150-5p, has-miR-874-5p and has-miR-941. Studies show that circulating miR-150, miR-146a and miR-125b identified from childhood TB may have diagnostic value with a combination of differentially expressed miRNAs in childhood TB [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Has-miR-3179 and has-miR-19b-2* were identified the most increased and decreased miRNAs in a comparison of sputum samples from patients with TB and controls [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In patients with PTB, miR-29 levels were increased in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with an inverse correlation with IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. MIR144* levels were upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and active TB patients, targeting an autophagy and lysosomal protein (DRAM2), to contribute to the pathogenesis of TB by autophagic inhibition control [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Despite numerous studies on differentially expressed miRNAs in PTB, many challenges still exist in accurate normalization of miRNA levels for clinical use among different experiments. These results indicated the possibility that, as indicated in other reports, miRNAs are likely to participate in PTB pathogenesis.</p><p>Interaction networks between miRNAs, target genes and transcription factors are critical for an appropriate balance of gene expression in mammalian melanocytes [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our target gene prediction of 41 differentially expressed miRNAs revealed 359 putative target genes. Has-miRNA-4467/ITGB2, has-miR-941/ITGB2, has-miR-1268b/BCL2L11 and has-miR150-3p/ARHGAP11A regulatory axes need to be further investigated in future experiments. A previous study reported miR-150 is underexpressed in active TB [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Its primary target is a negative regulator of NK-cell maturation and a reduction of miR-150 levels may indicate development of fewer mature NK cells, which are early innate effector cells controlling invading pathogens [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The positive and negative regulation of miRNA&#x02013;mRNA pairs found in this study provides important clues for PTB pathogenesis.</p><p>We comprehensively investigated GO enrichment and KEGG pathways analysis for differentially expressed mRNA and targets of differentially expressed miRNA. With GO enrichment and pathway analysis together, we found 41 differentially expressed miRNAs grouped into 298 KEGG pathways and 2565 differential expression mRNAs grouped into 283 KEGG pathways. Shared by the two methods were 282 KEGG pathways, including important pathways in immunity and metabolism pathway such as MAPK signaling, phagosome, calcium and HTLV-I infection signaling pathway. A previous study reported the activation of MAPK signaling in macrophages by nonpathogenic mycobacteria infection which leads to synthesis of microbicidal molecules, including TNF-&#x003b1;, which mediates inflammatory immune responses and antipathogens [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan from Mtb blocks phagosome maturation by inhibiting a signaling cascade of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calmodulin and PI3K. The arrest of phagosomal maturation by mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan is an effective mechanism used by mycobacteria for long-term survival in host cells [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Protective immunity to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> depends on correct function of T cells and their interaction with macrophages. HTLV-1 preferentially infects T cells and causes chronic T-cell dysfunction, which appears to impair the immune response to specific pathogens [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. HTLV-1 infection may increase an individual's susceptibility to active TB [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our results suggested that differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs associated with immune pathways might contribute to PTB pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results provide novel insights into PTB pathogenesis.
