In TB, hypoxia initiates the angiogenesis required for the formation of granulomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor limits infection burden and dissemination, and improves oxygenation to granulomas by normalizing vasculature in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>-infected zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The effect of hypoxia on the pathogen is diverse. Human &#x003b2;-defensin-2 is upregulated in hypoxia in macrophages, inhibiting intracellular mycobacterial growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Conversely, hypoxia increases survival fitness in <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> with the microbe adapting to hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, inducing a non-replicating state or dormancy to become less susceptible to anti-mycobacterial treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Neutrophils, which secrete MMP-8,-9 and neutrophil elastase, are abundant in the respiratory secretions of TB patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Neutrophil recruitment is associated with increased pathology in TB animal models, and the unique TB gene signature detected in patients reflects neutrophil activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In hypoxia, human neutrophils demonstrate decreased apoptosis and respiratory burst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Hypoxia-inducible factor-&#x003b1; (HIF-&#x003b1;), activated in neutrophils in states of hypoxia and infection, prolongs the life-span of leukocytes, reduces bacterial burden and enhances reactive nitrogen species in neutrophils prior to infection in a mycobacterial model in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, hypoxia decreases apoptosis and increases life-span in human neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The relationship between hypoxia and neutrophil-driven pathology in TB has not been investigated and mechanisms by which neutrophils may increase inflammatory tissue damage are poorly defined. We hypothesize that a hypoxic environment exacerbates neutrophil-dependent immunopathology in TB. We show that hypoxia increases neutrophil MMP-8, -9 and neutrophil elastase secretion in TB, which then drive matrix destruction. Increased protease activity is dependent on the HIF-1&#x003b1; pathway. Conversely, the production of NETs is suppressed by hypoxia. Taken together, the data show that hypoxic neutrophils increase immune-mediated pathology by up-regulating enzymes that destroy the extracellular matrix in TB by a HIF-1&#x003b1;-dependent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> culture</title><p id="Par6"><italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was cultured in supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 medium (BD Biosciences).
