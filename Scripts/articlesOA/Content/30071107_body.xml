<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is estimated that more than two billion people worldwide are infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), but only 5&#x02013;10% of these individuals develop TB during their lifetime [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The geriatric population represents a large reservoir of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is difficult to diagnose and treat tuberculosis in aged individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Approximately 57% of tuberculosis deaths occur in the aged population (above 50), and this burden is high in developed countries [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Immunosuppressive conditions, such as HIV infection, diabetes mellitus and drug and alcohol abuse, are risk factors that increase the chances of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation in people with LTBI [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, individuals with alcoholism show higher relapse rates and a higher probability of having multidrug-resistant TB [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Alcoholism leads to the development of liver cirrhosis, cancer, insulin resistance, epilepsy, hypertension, psoriasis, preterm birth complications, cardiovascular diseases and stroke [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chronic alcohol consumption impairs the host immune response to cancer and infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Alcohol impairs monocyte phagocytic and antigen-presenting capacities and suppresses the alveolar macrophage production of monokines, such as IL-23, in response to infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Alcohol-exposed dendritic cells produce more IL-10 and less IL-12, suggesting an inhibitory effect on dendritic cell function [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In humans and experimental mice, chronic alcohol consumption makes neutrophils hypo-responsive to bacterial infections[<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Prolonged alcohol consumption induces type I interferon (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Alcohol impairs NK cell trafficking and inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Chronic alcohol consumption impairs adaptive immune responses mediated by B and T-cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These immunosuppressive effects of alcohol are more severe in elderly individuals than in young individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Chronic alcohol consumption makes the host susceptible to various bacterial infections, including TB [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Epidemiological and immunological evidence strongly suggest a link between alcoholism and the worsening of TB disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Chronic alcohol consumption impairs the immune responses of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alcohol feeding before BCG vaccination reduces T cell responses, but there are no effects when BCG vaccination is delivered prior to alcohol feeding [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These studies were performed after the short term-feeding of mice with alcohol, and the mechanism(s) involved in host susceptibility remain unknown. The long-term effects of alcohol consumption on host defense mechanisms against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection are also unknown, particularly in old individuals.</p><p>In this study, we determined the survival of alcohol-fed young and old mice infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>.

However, limited information is available regarding the mechanisms involved in alcohol-mediated host susceptibility to <italic>Mtb</italic> and other intracellular bacterial infections. In the current study, we fed young and old mice control and alcohol diets and determined the mortality rates and the immune mechanisms involved in host susceptibility to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Approximately 80% of the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected alcohol-fed young mice died within 5 months; however, only 25% of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected alcohol-fed old mice and 25% of alcohol-fed uninfected young mice died during the same period.

No experimental animal studies have been performed to determine the effects of chronic alcohol feeding in aging and <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. In the current study, we found that alcohol diet-fed young mice (1&#x02013;2 months) are more susceptible to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and have a higher mortality rate than alcohol diet-fed old mice (17&#x02013;22 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007174.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Our findings suggest that alcohol worsens the TB pathology in the early stage of life and leads to increased mortality.</p><p>We found that IFN-&#x003b1; is responsible for the early death of alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice. IFN-&#x003b1; is a type 1 interferon that belongs to the interferon family, which regulates the immune responses to infection, cancer and autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

In the current study, we found that IFN-&#x003b1; produced by Ly6G+ cells was associated with macrophage necroptosis and fatal immunopathology in the lungs of young alcohol diet-fed mice IFNAR1 signaling is detrimental during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and promotes excess inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, in the current study, we found that <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected alcohol diet-fed mice survived for a longer period of time and had less bacterial burden in their lungs when type 1 IFN signaling pathways were blocked.</p><p>Old mice express transient early resistance to pulmonary tuberculosis, and type 1 cytokines have no influence on this early resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is known that several signaling pathways are defective in old mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The transient resistance in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice is due to a population of memory CD8+ T cells that express several receptors for Th1 cytokines; in addition, in aged mice, lung macrophages secret more proinflammatory cytokines in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We have not determined the CD8+ cell and macrophage responses in alcoholic old mice; however, our results demonstrate that alcohol-fed mice were unable to enhance IFN-&#x003b1; production in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice, and there were no effects on mortality compared to the non-alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice. IFN-&#x003b1; production in young alcoholic <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice significantly reduced their survival. Our current findings suggest that defective signaling pathways that are involved in the production of IFN-&#x003b1; in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice may be protecting them from alcohol-mediated lung cell necroptosis.</p><p>In various experimental models, it was shown that immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and Ly6G+ cells, produce type 1 interferons, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the major source [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, only less than 1% of leucocytes are dendritic cells, and fifty percent of blood leucocytes are Ly6G+ cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Necrosis and Ly6G+ cell infiltration in the lung granuloma are characteristic features of tuberculosis granulomas, and these properties are associated with increased mycobacterial load and exacerbated lung pathology in human and experimental animals [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Netting Ly6G+ cells are the major inducers of type I IFN production [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whole blood transcript signatures for active TB patients and pathway analyses revealed that the TB signature is dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile that consists of both IFN-&#x003b3; and type I IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

We have further investigated whether IFN-&#x003b1;-producing CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells are neutrophils. We found that these cells express a unique phenotype, including some neutrophils markers (positive for CD11b, CD200 and CD163 but negative for F4/80, CD68, CD115, CD11c, and Ly6C), suggesting these cells are not neutrophils. In the current study, we found fewer CD11b+Ly6G+ cells in the lungs of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice than in those of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice. We have not determined the factors underlying the reduced CD11b+Ly6G+ infiltration in the lungs of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice, but it is known that in old individuals, the neutrophil lifespan is decreased, neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow proliferate less, neutrophil recruitment at the site of inflammation is reduced, and CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells are less functional due to alterations in signaling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Our results suggest that alcohol consumption can enhance these defects in old mice and that Ly6G+ neutrophil- like cells are unable to migrate to the lungs of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice, resulting in less IFN-&#x003b1; production and necroptosis and enhanced survival.</p><p>We found that IFN-&#x003b1; produced by Ly6G+ cells in alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice induces necroptosis in lung macrophages. Necroptosis is programmed necrosis that differs from other death pathways (apoptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis) due to the requirement of a unique signaling pathway associated with the activation of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases 1 and 3 [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Caspase 1 expression was similar among all groups of infected mice, but RIP-1 and RIP-3 expression was significantly higher in the lungs of alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice than in those of control diet-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice and alcohol diet-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected old mice. We also found that RIP-1 and RIP-3 expression was restricted to macrophages and that IFN-&#x003b1;-producing Ly6G+ cells were colocalized around macrophages. These findings suggest that IFN-&#x003b1;-producing Ly6G+ cells in alcohol-fed <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected young mice enhance necroptosis in lung macrophages.</p><p>Necroptosis exacerbates inflammatory responses to infection which contributes to tissue damage and pathology [<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007174.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

The slides were then incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight in PBST with the appropriate dilutions of the following primary antibodies: anti-Ly6G (1:200), anti-F4/80 (1:50), anti-IFN-&#x003b1;-FITC-conjugated (1:50), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:400), anti-CD68 (1:100), anti-CD115 (1:50), anti-CD200 (1:50), anti-CD163 (1:50), anti-CD11c (1:100), anti-Ly6C (1:50) and anti-RIP-1/RIP-3 (1:50); subsequently, the slides were washed thoroughly 3 &#x000d7; 5 min with PBS. Then, the tissue sections were stained with the respective secondary antibodies at 1:1000 dilutions (v/v), washed again with PBS for 3 &#x000d7; 5 min, and mounted with fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI. The slides were then examined and analyzed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta). An IgG isotype secondary control was used for all the confocal microscopy studies, and Zen 2009 software (Carl Zeiss) was used for image acquisition; then, the images were processed/quantified uniformly for each experiment using ImageJ NIH software. Representative images from three different independent experiments are shown.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).
