<sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In the year 2016, the World Health Organization reported 10.4 million new cases of TB. Elimination of TB appears to be an unrealistic goal in the near future unless TB prevention can be dramatically improved. Prevention of TB can be achieved by vigorous infection control measures, treatment of individuals that are latently infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (LTBI) and most effectively by a preventive vaccine. Almost 100&#x02009;years ago, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu&#x000e9;rin developed a vaccine based on attenuated <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> [Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG)], which is still the only available anti-TB vaccine in clinical use today (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG is among the most commonly used of all vaccines worldwide, its effect is largely on the attenuation of severe forms of the disease in children and it does not prevent TB in adults (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In view of this important limitation, there is an urgent need for the development of a novel TB vaccine, with the property to prevent active TB in adults and children (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). None of the candidates have shown a significant protective effect against TB infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The main obstacle to validate a new vaccine candidate&#x02019;s ability to protect against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is the lack of a robust correlate of protection (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) appears to be a promising marker to detect protective immunity of vaccine-induced cells toward <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Improved immune control of mycobacterial growth was demonstrated following primary <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccination when compared to individuals who had been <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccinated as a child and revaccinated (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In another human challenge trial, improved immune control was reported in individuals with past <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccination, but no additional protective effect was seen after MVA85A-vaccination (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). And H56:CAF01-vaccination revealed an enhanced immune-control in the MGIA corresponding to <italic>in vivo</italic> protection in mice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). So far, the MGIA has been evaluated in the following cell types and species: splenocytes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and bone-marrow-derived macrophages in mice (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), whole blood of Rhesus macaques (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), whole blood cells, frozen and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and antigen-expanded T-cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) in humans.</p><p>In order to test the MGIA as a pulmonary correlate of immune protection from mycobacterial infection, we recruited <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-na&#x000ef;ve healthy adult volunteers and analyzed mycobacteria-specific immune responses and growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> growth inhibition model in bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALCs) and PBMC before and after vaccination with <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>Healthy <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve subjects underwent phlebotomy and bronchoscopy before and 8&#x02009;weeks after intracutaneously administered <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccination.

In our study, this vitamin D-effect is used as a model to monitor improved immune control as expected in an effective vaccine.

To our knowledge, the current study represents the first description of the MGIA as a surrogate marker for vaccine-induced antimycobacterial activity using <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in human cells (in PBMC and especially in human lung cells), an aspect that has not been addressed so far.</p><p>Compared to the mentioned previous studies, which have used MOIs between 0.0001 and 0.0002, it needs to be stated that the MOI of 0.058 used in the current study is significantly higher. In order to make sure that this MOI would allow the measurement of an enhanced antituberculosis response, we included vitamin D to our experiments. As we observed a vitamin D-dependent average TTP increase by 17.2&#x02009;h in PBMC and 20.6&#x02009;h in BALC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A), we concluded that even at an MOI of 0.058, a given vaccination-dependent antituberculosis directed response leading to prolonged TTP values should have been detectable. This was not the case. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude, that different experimental conditions such as the use of a lower MOI could have led to different results. The current study may, however, indicate that the type of bacteria used in the MGIA needs to be considered. Several authors have shown that <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccination of human individuals induces growth inhibition of <italic>M. bovis BCG</italic>, whereas our experimental data suggest that <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG-vaccination does not lead to growth control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by human PBMC and BALC.</p><p>The TTP in BALC was significantly lower than TTP in PBMC, implicating higher growth rate in BALC. This effect was not seen in CFU read-outs, which may indicate that CFU and TTP measure different conditions. The MGIT-device detects fluorescence, if actively respiring micro-organisms consume the oxygen. In comparison, CFU documents mycobacteria in colonies on agar plates, where <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> grows typically eugone in firmly attached, beige, dry crumbles, but may differ in colony size. Latter observation may indicate a substantially reduced replication status of a given tiny/small colony. Microbiologists have described these small cell populations as persisters or dormant, non-growing bacteria with the capacity to regrow or viable but not-culturable (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).

We assume that small, slow-replicating colonies will be counted in the CFU analysis, but may be left underestimated in the MGIA assay, which documents rates of metabolism and growth by oxygen consumption and explain the observed differences between the TTP and CFU analysis.</p><p>Another reason to explain this difference in growth behavior might be cell differences between the lung and the blood compartment (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Lavage consisted of significantly less lymphocytes than PBMC and additionally a lower number of cytotoxic CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells expressing Perforin was found in BALC in comparison with PBMC. These results once more demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with PBMC may not imitate the cell-based immune responses and control in human TB (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>Our study is limited by the number of participants and by the lack of an alternative and more promising vaccine candidate for the immune intervention. Although other candidate markers such as mRNA transcripts (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) or cytokines (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) may also appear promising as correlates for protection from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, our findings may serve as valuable proof-of-concept for future vaccine evaluations.</p><p>In conclusion, vaccination with <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG did not result in <italic>ex vivo</italic> growth inhibition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in human alveolar macrophages from healthy volunteers despite the development of antimycobacterial immune responses in peripheral blood.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and the Ethics Committee of the University of L&#x000fc;beck.
