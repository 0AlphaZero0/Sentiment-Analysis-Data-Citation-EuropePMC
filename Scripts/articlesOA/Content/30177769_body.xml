<sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tuberculosis (TB) remains a worldwide health problem with 10.4 million new cases each year, and more than 1.7 million deaths in 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These incidences have gradually declined, but have not achieved the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For first-line defence against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), macrophages are an essential component for the complex immune reactions required against this pathogen. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages are the initial defence against Mtb in the lung. Upon infection, blood monocyte- derived macrophages are recruited to the site of infection where they provide the innate defence, in addition to initiating and controlling the adaptive immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">CD206, known as mannose receptor and C-type lectin, is primary expressed on the surface of macrophages and immature dendritic cells, where it acts as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. CD206 interacts with glycoproteins and glycolipids found on the surface of pathogens, including viruses, fungi, and bacteria (e.g., <italic>Mtb</italic>); thus, CD206 plays a role in immune recognition of pathogens, following antigen internalization and presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, CD206 functions in clearance of glycoproteins from circulation, including sulphated glycoprotein hormones and glycoproteins released in response to pathological events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Following proteolytic cleavage from macrophage membranes, soluble forms of CD206 (sCD206) are found in the periphery. Similar to membrane forms, soluble forms of CD206 also recognize sulphated and mannosylated carbohydrates, and can alter the innate and adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">CD206 is a marker of alternatively activated macrophages, known as M2 macrophages. In contrast to classically activated macrophages (known as M1 macrophages), M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory and contribute to tissue repair, resolution of inflammation, induction of immune tolerance, and protection from excessive inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the ability of CD206 to aid pathogen internalization is exploited by <italic>Mtb</italic> to facilitate infection within macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting CD206 can serve as an immune escape mechanism and as a novel therapeutic target. Therefore, we hypothesized that CD206 may provide a potential biomarker in TB, where macrophages exhibit an immune regulatory phenotype. The present study evaluated serum and pleural CD206 concentrations in patients with pulmonary TB (PTB), and examined membrane-bound CD206 expression in the lung and pleural tissues by using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical characteristics</title><p id="Par5">Clinical characteristics of PTB patients are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplement Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

PTB patients had elevated levels of serum sCD206, compared with controls; enhanced expression of CD206 was also found in epithelial granulomas in the lung and pleural tissues from PTB patients. Compared with pleural effusions, serum sCD206 levels were significantly elevated, which was associated with poor outcome in both cohorts. Particularly, more than eight times higher mortality was found in PTB patients with elevated sCD206. Collectively, our results suggested that CD206 could predict prognosis of patients with PTB.</p><p id="Par15">Hallmarks of macrophages include diversity and plasticity, as macrophages express an array of PRRs. Among these PRRs, CD206 is preferentially expressed on the surface of M2 macrophages and recognizes various pathogens, including <italic>Mtb</italic>, via its mannosylated surface structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. CD206 ligation on non-activated macrophages produces an anti-inflammatory response by stimulating the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory IL-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. During <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, dynamic changes occur in macrophage polarization; macrophage transformation from M1 to M2 is observed over time following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and M2 macrophages are spatially dominant in tissue surrounding the caseum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Indeed, enhanced expression of CD206 was found in lung and pleural tissues from patients with PTB. The membrane form of CD206 on the surface of M2 macrophages undergoes proteolytic cleavage, leading to the release of sCD206<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Notably, detailed mechanisms for generating sCD206 are not fully known, and direct assessments of sCD206 and CD206-expressing macrophages at the site of infection were not performed in the present study; however, high concentrations of sCD206 might represent activation of M2 macrophages in PTB.</p><p id="Par16">M2 macrophages are involved in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, preventing excessive inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; CD206 functions as a scavenger receptor to maintain homeostasis by clearing lung environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, engagement of <italic>Mtb</italic> with CD206 initiates the phagosomal niche, enhancing the potential for <italic>Mtb</italic> survival in the macrophage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The precise immunological role of elevated sCD206 in the periphery in patients with PTB was not elucidated in the present study. However, our results showed that sCD206 correlated with inflammatory markers and disease severity, providing prognostic value. Collectively, our results indicated involvement of CD206 in the pathogenesis of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p id="Par17">The present study was the first to evaluate pleural sCD206 levels in pulmonary disease. Tb pleurisy is considered to be a delayed allergic reaction to mycobacterial antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; thus, <italic>Mtb</italic> is rarely cultured from pleural fluids. Indeed, an increased number of regulatory T cells and a decreased number of effector T cells were found in pleural fluid in patients with TB pleurisy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with these reports, levels of immunoregulatory molecules indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and CD163 were elevated in pleural effusions of patients with TB pleurisy, compared with levels in the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; this suggested induction of immune tolerance in the thoracic cavity in patients with TB pleurisy. Thus, we expected elevated pleural sCD206 concentrations in pleural fluids from patients with TB pleurisy. Unexpectedly, pleural sCD206 levels were significantly reduced, compared with levels in blood. Similar to our results, Jiang <italic>et al</italic>. reported a greater number of M1 macrophages and a reduced number of M2 macrophages in pleural fluids from patients with TB pleurisy, compared with levels in the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, these results suggested distinct polarization between macrophages and T cells, as well as complex <italic>Mtb</italic>-immune cell interactions in TB pleurisy.</p><p id="Par18">The prevalence of TB in Japan is gradually declining; it was 13.9 per 100,000 in 2016, which remains higher than in Western countries (typically &#x0003c;10 per 100,000). The incidence of MDR-TB was reported to be 0.5%; more than 70% of patients were over 60 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, most of the subjects in our cohorts were older and exhibited comorbidities, which resulted in a higher mortality rate. Although standard regimens have been established, concerns remain in the treatment of TB, including extended treatment duration, spread of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB, and HIV co-infection. Therefore, the development of adjunct host-directed therapies (HDTs) by modulating host inflammatory pathways and augmenting components of host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms is needed to improve cure rates in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, although the present study involved relatively small cohorts, this investigation of prognostic determinants might contribute to the development of HDTs.</p><p id="Par19">There were several limitations in this study. First, as described above, the cohort analysed in the study was relatively small. Second, a wide array of TB biomarkers are available&#x02014;for diagnosis, assessment of the risk of disease development (latent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection), and measurement of treatment outcomes&#x02014;with different platforms including cytokines, gene expression, and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Among these, TB-specific host biomarkers have been reported; interferon (IFN)-inducible neutrophil-driven transcriptional signature was associated with TB diagnosis and correlated with response to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Third, as with most surrogate markers in TB, sCD206 is not specific for TB and exhibits a demonstrable false-positive rate. Thus, interpretations should be made with awareness of these limitations.</p><p id="Par20">In summary, the present study examined the clinical usefulness of the macrophage-mannose receptor, CD206, as a biomarker in patients with PTB. Enhanced CD206 expression in lung and pleural tissues from PTB patients, and higher concentrations of serum sCD206, were associated with reduced survival. These results warrant further study to determine the clinical usefulness of sCD206 as a biomarker for PTB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par21">This prospective study was conducted by using two cohorts of patients who had presented at referral hospitals for the treatment of TB in Shizuoka, Japan.

Correlations between sCD206 and clinical parameters were analysed by using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation technique. Overall survival time was measured from date of PTB diagnosis. To examine the ability of sCD206 to predict mortality in patients with PTB, two distinct cohorts (Tenryu cohort as discovery cohort and Shizuoka cohort as validation cohort) were evaluated. An ROC curve was used to evaluate the ability of sCD206 to discriminate between patients who survived and who died during admission. The optimal cut-off value of sCD206 in the Tenryu cohort, which ensured the best combinations of sensitivity and specificity, was obtained. The optimal cutoff value in the Tenryu cohort was applied to evaluate the Shizuoka cohort and combined cohort data. Cumulative survival probabilities were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method with cut-off vales obtained from Tenryu cohort. The log-rank test was used to compare survival among patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with combined cohort subjects to predict mortality. Among the statistically significant covariates in the univariate analyses, several covariates were excluded because of potential confounders and statistical limitations. Statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism Version 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and SPSS Statistics (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) software.
