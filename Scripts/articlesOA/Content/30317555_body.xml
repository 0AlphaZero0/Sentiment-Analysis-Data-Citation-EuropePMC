<sec id="imm13012-sec-0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are many effective vaccines available to protect humans against infectious diseases. However, the development of vaccines against &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; pathogens remains challenging. For example, vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still under development. Furthermore, some existing vaccines require improved efficacy, e.g. vaccines against <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, influenza viruses, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species causing malaria. In addition, new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease will continue to emerge, which require new vaccines to prevent epidemics. Also, therapeutic vaccines against non&#x02010;infectious diseases, such as cancer, are needed. The lack of in&#x02010;depth knowledge of the pathogen and requirements for protective immunity often hamper development.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Application of systems biology during the development of vaccines, or systems vaccinology, can be an important tool to enhance insight into immune responses induced by (candidate) vaccines or identification of (early) correlates of protection.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Alan Aderem defined systems biology as a &#x02018;comprehensive quantitative analysis of the manner in which all the components of a biological system interact functionally over time and space that is executed by an interdisciplinary team of investigators.&#x02019;<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> This definition can readily be applied to study the responses to vaccination. Systems&#x02010;based approaches are often labeled unbiased and broad (sometimes even the word &#x02018;holistic&#x02019; is used). However, that is only true to a certain extent, as defining a research objective is already introducing bias. Often only a few analytical techniques are used (as described in the next section) to address the objectives (Fig. <xref rid="imm13012-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Usually, there are also limitations in availability of materials. For example, in preclinical studies using mice the amount of blood that can be collected is very limited, whereas in clinical studies mainly body fluids can be used, although biopsies and mucosal lavages are sometimes available. Also, time is an essential parameter of systems vaccinology for studying kinetics and cause&#x02013;effect relations, but repeated sampling is limited in humans. In this review, we describe current developments of the techniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology and discuss the implementation of systems vaccinology in the vaccine research and development chain.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="imm13012-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Systems vaccinology approach in a pre&#x02010;clinical setting. A biological system can range from a single cell to the complete human body consisting of different levels such as genes, proteins, cells, tissues and organs that interact with each other. The biological processes in these levels have distinct time&#x02010; and space&#x02010;resolved kinetics. Information on the immune status can be acquired by analysis at the molecular level of the actors (i.e. gene expression, protein synthesis, lipid secretion and production of metabolites), or by determining the changes in cellular composition and morphology. To study the relationship and interaction between all distinct levels of a biological system, a comprehensive approach is required, using multiple analytical techniques. Data, preferably obtained during a time course of the same subject, are combined for further analysis. Network analysis (e.g. Cytoscape) is performed to determine co&#x02010;expression profiles, indicating interdependence. Functional analysis is executed in public databases, e.g. DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.david.ncifcrf.gov">http://www.david.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>), STRING (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.string-db.org">http://www.string-db.org</ext-link>), BioGPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogps.org">http://www.biogps.org</ext-link>), and Interferome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interferome.org">http://www.interferome.org</ext-link>). Combined data form a response profile for a vaccine. Vaccine profiles can be compared with other vaccine or infection profiles and used for multiple applications as mentioned in Table <xref rid="imm13012-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-3" xlink:href="IMM-156-33-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="imm13012-sec-0002"><title>Systems vaccinology techniques</title><p>Twenty years ago, Rino Rappuoli and co&#x02010;workers introduced reverse vaccinology, a genome&#x02010;based method to identify new leads with strong antibody responses.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> However, the role of immunogens is currently studied in conjunction with other factors, such as adjuvants and antigen delivery, as these influence immune responses and induction of immunological memory that are key for vaccine efficacy.

In addition, they also identified in HeLa cell lysates cross&#x02010;links from protein domains lacking X&#x02010;ray or cryo&#x02010;EM three&#x02010;dimensional&#x02010;structure data,<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> illustrating the great potential of this strategy in identifying protein&#x02013;protein interactions. To detect protein&#x02013;protein interactions by XL&#x02010;MS, it is mandatory that the amino acids in the interaction area are reactive with the cross&#x02010;linker.</p><p>Secreted proteins play an essential role in communication between immune cells. The immune secretome consists of a wide range of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors, interferons and interleukins. Multiplex immunoassays and ELISA methods target predefined proteins from the secretome, based on cytokine&#x02010;specific antibodies. In contrast, newly developed MS&#x02010;based proteomics methods like BioOrthogonal Non&#x02010;Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT) can target the full repertoire of secreted proteins, although limited to <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments only. In a BONCAT assay, an amino acid is replaced by an azido&#x02010;containing analogue (e.g. methionine replacement by azidohomoalanine). The azido moiety allows for purification of excreted, low abundance, newly synthesized proteins from cell culture medium by click&#x02010;chemistry using alkyne&#x02010;functionalized beads.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> The amino acid modification does not affect the structure and function of the protein, nor does it alter the protein synthesis rate or cell viability.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> In combination with multiplexing technologies based on Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT), <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#x02010;dimethyl leucine (DiLeu) tagging or neutron&#x02010;encoded reagents, up to 25 samples can be multiplexed in a single run, for unbiased identification and relative quantification of <italic>de novo</italic>&#x02010;synthesized proteins in the secretome.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>
</p><p>Limitations of MS&#x02010;based proteomics lay in the fact that, like transcriptomics, it is dependent on the availability and quality of annotated protein databases, e.g. number of annotated genes or proteins. The sensitivity of the current generation of mass spectrometers is high, but could improve further to reach the levels achieved with, for example, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. However, as described here and by others,<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> MS is currently very useful for the characterization of a wide range of immunological mechanisms in the context of infection and vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="imm13012-sec-0005"><title>Miscellaneous techniques</title><p>The Systems Vaccinology approach is not limited to the common application of transcriptomics and proteomics and novel techniques and applications are more often applied (Table <xref rid="imm13012-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For example, metabolomics is a high&#x02010;throughput technology to study metabolic pathways in biological systems. The metabolome covers all small molecules and intermediates (usually &#x0003c; 2000 dalton (Da) molecular weight) that are highly dynamic in the catabolic and anabolic processes of cells. In many immunological studies, metabolomics is now an integral part of system vaccinology, to predict biomarkers and to evaluate vaccine efficacy.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> Untargeted metabolome analysis requires many different sample preparation procedures and analytical tools to identify all metabolites. Gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, MS, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance are frequently used or combined to study the metabolome, although with limited precision and accuracy. Improved accuracy, precision and specificity of these assays can be obtained by using semi&#x02010;targeted or targeted metabolomics strategies if the chemical identities of the analytes are known beforehand.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="imm13012-sec-0006"><title>Humoral and cell&#x02010;mediated responses</title><p>In the context of systems vaccinology, conventional assays that are neither high throughput, nor unbiased, remain necessary to confirm hypotheses. Histology is still the common method to confirm the influx and the location of immune cells in tissues as a result of an infection or immunization. However, visualization of cells in tissue sections continually improves by better immunoimaging techniques<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref> such as confocal microscopy. <italic>Ex vivo</italic>, assays such as ELISA and flow cytometry are applied to identify and quantify specific cell subsets as well as their activation state and function (such as cytokine production or proliferation). These immunological techniques for studying these responses have also become more powerful. Flow cytometry equipment has improved, for example, by combining the measurement of the amount of proteins per cell (flow cytometry), with visualization of their localization within the cells (microscopy), so&#x02010;called imaging flow cytometry.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> Also, more fluorescent labels have become available, increasing the number of markers that can be investigated simultaneously. Multi&#x02010;parameter flow cytometry enables the identification of these specialized, often rare, subsets of cells.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref> For example, innate cells that play a crucial role in pathogen recognition and in influencing the magnitude and direction of adaptive immunity, such as specific subtypes of antigen&#x02010;presenting cells and innate lymphoid cells. With respect to adaptive immune responses, the ability to identify rare subsets mainly focuses on antigen&#x02010;specific B&#x02010;cells<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> and T&#x02010;cells,<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> both circulating and tissue&#x02010;resident cells, and precursors as well as effector and memory cells.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Cytometry by Time&#x02010;of&#x02010;Flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF)<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref> uses rare&#x02010;metal isotopes instead of fluorescent labels for labeling, thereby almost abolishing the spectral overlap seen with fluorescent dyes and expanding the number markers that can be measured simultaneously even further. For example, Van Unen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> identified 142 immune subsets in the human mucosal immune system.</p><p>In addition, the opportunity of sorting specific subsets of cells not only as a population, but also as single cells, in combination with high&#x02010;throughput analysis of the isolated cells, added yet another dimension. Lymphocyte epitope specificity necessarily is extremely diverse to fight the wide array of possible pathogens and is accomplished by randomness through several recombinatorial events and additional random changes during lymphocyte ontogeny. For example, the number of different antibodies human B&#x02010;cells can produce, outnumbers the B lymphocytes (~10<sup>11</sup>) in the human body.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> High&#x02010;throughput single&#x02010;cell analysis enabled detailed interrogation of these broad B&#x02010;cell and T&#x02010;cell repertoires.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> These techniques also revealed that priming might not always be predictive, as preferential expansion of B&#x02010;cells and T&#x02010;cells also plays an important role.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref> This illustrates that enhanced understanding of lymphocyte responses not only leads to identification of novel early markers for efficacy of vaccines, but is also useful for their evaluation. Hypotheses with respect to B&#x02010;cell and T&#x02010;cell epitopes can be derived from MS&#x02010;based studies as described in the former paragraph. Moreover, current knowledge with respect to HLA specificity has also enabled the prediction of T&#x02010;cell epitopes <italic>in silico</italic>, decreasing the time needed for analysis.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref> As B&#x02010;cell epitopes are often conformational, current knowledge does not yet enable <italic>in silico</italic> predictions to the same extent as for T&#x02010;cells. For B&#x02010;cell epitope analysis of complex multi&#x02010;protein vaccines, antibody&#x02013;antigen binding can be investigated using two&#x02010;dimensional gel electrophoresis with Western blotting to pinpoint immunogenic antigens.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref> Subsequently, peptide arrays can be applied to investigating the immunodominant epitopes of these discovered antigens.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref>
</p><p>The ability to isolate single antibody&#x02010;producing B&#x02010;cells and subsequent DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes in high&#x02010;throughput settings (Ig&#x02010;seq) has greatly impacted the depth of understanding with respect to the antibody repertoire.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> Single&#x02010;cell sorting in combination with B&#x02010;cell cloning has enabled the isolation of specific antibodies able to neutralize pathogens, including rare antigens with characteristics that are of special interest, such as antibodies that are broadly cross&#x02010;reactive among highly variable viruses by binding to conserved regions. This was, for example, found for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes upon infection as well as vaccination.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">61</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">64</xref> In general, this has shifted the focus from the most immunogenic epitopes to the more conserved regions. However, it has proved challenging to design vaccines that induce strong responses against these regions. Challenges with respect to design of vaccines inducing such broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV and influenza virus were extensively reviewed by Corti and Lanzavecchia.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">65</xref> For example, other regions might need to be removed or de&#x02010;immunized and the conserved epitopes might not be easily accessible, preventing the vaccine&#x02010;induced antibodies from binding to the natural target. Another point of attention is that a focus on increased immunogenicity should not lead to a decrease in safety. For example, antibodies with long or charged CDR&#x02010;H3 regions enable binding to occluded sites on pathogens and mediate pathogen neutralization but are also more likely to be autoreactive.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref>
</p><p>IgG antibody levels have served as correlates of protection for traditional vaccines,<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">66</xref> but in the context of systems vaccinology, not only antibody quantity, but also functionality is increasingly investigated. Antibodies may inhibit other functional antibodies or enhance disease by facilitating virus entry into cells. However, non&#x02010;neutralizing antibodies may still be functional and could have more impact on protection from disease than neutralizing antibodies, for instance by interaction of the antibody constant domain with Fc receptors. This interaction is determined by two characteristics, antibody subclass (irreversible) and antibody glycosylation (fast and reversible) that can for example impact the affinity for Fc receptors.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">67</xref> The glycosylation profile of antigen&#x02010;specific antibodies is changed upon vaccination, whereas the glycosylation profile of total IgG is not affected. Interestingly, despite very different pre&#x02010;vaccination glycosylation levels in populations in different parts of the world,<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> profiles induced by vaccination are similar, as was shown after influenza vaccination.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">69</xref>
</p><p>However, different vaccine formulations can induce different glycosylation profiles.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> This is likely also influenced by the adjuvant present in the formulation, either directly or via cytokine induction.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">70</xref> Though the biological implications of these differences are not yet clear, the recent developments in systems serology demonstrate that multiple parameters of the antibody response, such as IgG subtype and antibody glycosylation among others, influence antibody functionally and therefore vaccine efficacy.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">71</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">72</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref>

Systems biology can assist to investigate host&#x02013;pathogen interactions by looking at pathogen behavior and clearance after infection. A natural infection sometimes induces effective protection, e.g. mumps, that may serve as a benchmark for a vaccine, whereas other pathogens may display immune evasive or suppressive responses, which one would like to avoid in a vaccine&#x02010;induced response.

Moreover, systems vaccinology analyses are also useful in a clinical study itself to obtain better insight into safety and efficacy (Fig. <xref rid="imm13012-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

High responders, based on serum antibodies, contained modules of genes expressed in NK cells, whereas modules of genes related to myeloid cells, monocytes and integrin cell surface interactions were detected in low responders. These signatures enable vaccine responses to be distinguished in an early phase and perhaps even allows steering of immune responses in low responders by adjustment of the vaccine. In a phase I randomized controlled trial using AS03&#x02010;adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated split&#x02010;virus H5N1 influenza vaccines, the effect of adjuvant on vaccine&#x02010;induced responses, such as serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels, was investigated.

At this point in the vaccine life cycle, correlates of protection, or surrogates thereof, are sometimes known, however the mechanism of action is often underexposed. Systems approaches in this phase are not routinely applied, as far as we know. The validation of the methods is complex and expensive, with the added value not yet proven convincingly. However, pioneering studies have demonstrated that vaccine efficacy after yellow fever and influenza vaccination could be predicted in an early stage after immunization by analyzing molecular signatures.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0126" ref-type="ref">126</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">127</xref> For the yellow fever vaccine, the enhanced levels of specific gene expression profiles in blood obtained 1 to 7 days after vaccination were predictive for antigen&#x02010;specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T&#x02010;cell levels and antibody titers usually obtained 60 days after immunization, thus inducing a significant time advantage. In a clinical phase, regulators might want to see positive classical end&#x02010;points but for post&#x02010;marketing purposes this approach of looking at early correlates may be valuable. Furthermore, these studies are of value in comparative studies of different vaccine formulations.

For example, researchers predicted age&#x02010;related vaccine hypo&#x02010;responses against a hepatitis B vaccine in the elderly with a gene marker<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0130" ref-type="ref">130</xref> and exposed transcriptomic signatures of vaccine&#x02010;induced immunity, both cellular and humoral immune responses, after seasonal influenza vaccination specifically in older adults.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0131" ref-type="ref">131</xref> Obviously, these post&#x02010;marketing surveillance studies facilitate further clinical development of improved vaccines or provide insight into general mechanisms that will enhance future vaccine development, even if correlates of protection are unknown.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">132</xref>
</p><p>Finally, a great benefit of systems vaccinology studies is the ability to combine data sets from vaccine responses against different pathogens in integrative network modeling to reveal detailed insight into universal signatures of vaccine responsiveness.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">118</xref>, <xref rid="imm13012-bib-0133" ref-type="ref">133</xref> Li <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="imm13012-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref> compared molecular signatures, induced by five different human vaccines against specific bacterial or viral infections, which could predict antibody responses.

</p><p>Investigating vaccine&#x02010;induced responses with systems vaccinology has led to a trend of gathering massive amounts of data going as deep as investigating every molecule in single cells. Acquiring large data sets is far easier than extracting novel relevant information from those data. Furthermore, the amount of data is constantly increasing, especially when combining data sets of different origin (genes versus proteins versus cells). This requires equally advanced tools for (i) data visualization and (ii) translation of content to knowledge and understanding, forcing a dialogue between vaccine developers and bioinformatics experts. In the future, implementation of artificial intelligence could assist in data processing and for data visualization online publications may become interactive allowing readers to scroll through, for example, the immune responses induced by immunization over time.</p><p>In summary, systems vaccinology is becoming a valuable tool in each phase of the vaccine development chain.
