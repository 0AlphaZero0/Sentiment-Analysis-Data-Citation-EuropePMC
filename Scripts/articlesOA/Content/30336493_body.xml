<sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major health problems worldwide.

However, the diagnosis TB uveitis is challenging in the absence of clinically apparent pulmonary disease because ocular tissue examinations are not readily available and biopsies are troublesome to perform.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The advent of the IFN-&#x003b3; release assay (IGRA) or QuantiFERON Gold TB (QFT) test enabled the identification of individuals with a prior <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb)</italic> infection. However, although the QFT test provides evidence of an immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic>, it lacks the specificity to distinguish between active and latent TB.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Whether QFT-positive uveitis is the result of a direct infection of the retina, an anti-retinal immune response in QFT-positive individuals or a combination of both is unclear.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore, using QFT as a diagnostic test for active TB is not feasible in cases suspect of active TB uveitis.</p><p>Histopathological studies in patients with uveitis, but without pathological lung findings, documented a <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

Importantly, these type 1 IFN-inducible gene transcripts differed from those observed in systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is among a group of systemic autoimmune diseases that contains subgroups of patients displaying a type 1 IFN-inducible gene expression pattern.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Several other studies have corroborated the use of type 1 IFN-inducible gene expression in the peripheral blood to distinguish active from latent TB infection.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Moreover, a rapid normalization of the type 1 IFN gene expression pattern upon successful ATT was reported.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Together, these observations underscore the role of type 1 IFN signaling in the pathogenesis of TB and the potential usefulness of the peripheral blood type 1 IFN transcriptome as a biomarker and monitoring tool in TB diagnostics and management. However, no studies of type 1 IFN-inducible blood transcriptome have been conducted in uveitis cases in relation to TB infection.</p><p>In our study, we identified a peripheral blood cell transcriptome consisting of 10 type 1 IFN-inducible genes that were strongly associated with active pulmonary TB without uveitis. When a type 1 IFN signature score was applied to this 10-gene set, a score &#x02265;5.61 displayed the optimal sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing active pulmonary (<italic>Mtb</italic> sputum smear-positive) TB patients without uveitis from healthy controls. In line with this result, the two TB uveitis cases diagnosed with active pulmonary TB and having positive <italic>Mtb</italic> sputum smear displayed a type 1 IFN signature score &#x0003e;5.61. This finding indicates that microbiologically proven active pulmonary TB with or without uveitis is associated with high expression of type 1 IFN-inducible genes. However, several additional uveitis cases, who were QFT-positive, displayed a positive type 1 IFN signature despite being <italic>Mtb</italic> sputum negative.</p><p>Over-diagnosis of uveitis TB due to the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test (i.e., laboratory and radiological investigations) is a recognized problem that may result in overzealous treatment of uveitis with ATT.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Within the uveitis group diagnosed with pulmonary TB on clinical grounds solely, we found 7 cases with a type 1 IFN signature score &#x0003c;5.61. In these cases, the uveitis was probably not related to active TB. Importantly, the type 1 IFN signature scores revealed two subgroups within the QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause. We propose that QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause and a type 1 IFN signature score &#x0003c;5.61 are unlikely to have uveitis related to active TB infection. This conclusion is supported by the high concordance within the set of 10 type 1 IFN-inducible genes identified in our study and the type-1 IFN inducible genes identified in other studies that did compare active with latent TB.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Furthermore, this finding is in agreement with other studies that compared patients with active and latent TB and reported a rapid decline in peripheral blood cell expression of type 1 IFN-inducible genes in active TB patients treated with a full ATT regimen.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Consequently, we expect that patients within the QFT-positive group with uveitis of unknown cause who display a positive type 1 IFN signature score (&#x02265;5.61) will have a higher likelihood of having uveitis due to active TB infection and beneficial reaction to ATT. Our series, however, lacks the results of type 1 IFN signature in QFT-positive patients without uveitis. Nevertheless, we propose that measurement of a peripheral blood type 1 IFN gene signature score can aid to the diagnostic workup and choice of treatment in patients with QFT-positive uveitis, as is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206073.g005">Fig 5B</xref>.</p><p>Elevated expression of type 1 IFN-inducible genes in peripheral blood cells is not specific to active TB disease. Type 1 IFN gene signatures are also associated with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as in Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome cases (~55%), systemic lupus erythematosus (~50%), and systemic sclerosis (~30%), and are also present in healthy control subjects (~5%).[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, differential expression of type 1 IFN-inducible genes between TB and systemic autoimmune diseases is clear. MxA is a type 1 IFN-inducible gene that encodes an important mediator of the early innate immune defense against viruses.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Elevated MxA expression is part of the peripheral blood type 1 IFN signature in systemic autoimmune disease patients.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Yet in our study elevated MxA gene expression was not found in peripheral blood from patients with active pulmonary TB compared to healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206073.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Therefore, our data support differential involvement of type 1 IFN-inducible genes among different diseases associated with type 1 IFN activity.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In autoimmune disease activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are thought to be the most dominant producers of type 1 IFN and thus inducers of the type 1 IFN gene signature, although other type 1 IFN producing cells are not excluded.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206073.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] There is data supporting involvement of pDCs in TB pathophysiology and pDCs may be a source of type 1 IFN in TB.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Yet, the relation between pDCs, type1 IFN and TB pathophysiology remains hardly studied so far and needs to be further elucidated. Moreover, other celtypes, including macrophages and epithelial cells may represent a source of type 1 IFN in TB.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] And more recently we demonstrated that <italic>Mtb</italic> infected retinal pigment epithelial cells are also strong producers of type 1 IFN and as such may be relevant to TB-associated uveitis.[<xref rid="pone.0206073.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>Our study was of exploratory nature and set up to identify whether a peripheral type 1 IFN gene signature could stratify <italic>Mtb</italic>-associated uveitis patients, either amongst patients with active TB disease or healthy controls. This is especially relevant for the diagnostic problematic group of patients that are QFT-positive and have uveitis of unknown cause, and subgroups (positive and negative type 1 IFN signature) could indeed be recognized, and as such might be qualified as high or low risk of having uveitis in relation to active TB. We did not include QFT-negative uveitis patients in our study as they are never suspected of TB-associated uveitis. However, it can be anticipated that a proportion of QFT-negative uveitis cases will be associated with a positive type-1 IFN gene signature, for instance in case of uveitis in association with autoimmune disease or toxoplasmosis.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a blood transcriptional signature of 10 type 1 IFN-inducible genes highly expressed in active pulmonary TB patients. Although further validation studies are required, our data suggest that this peripheral blood type 1 IFN gene signature has the potential to stratify patients with suspected active TB infection-associated uveitis into groups with either a low or high risk of having uveitis due to TB. We expect that this stratification forms a constructive basis for future diagnostic and treatment studies in QFT-positive patients with uveitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0206073.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Indonesian Society of Respirology (ISR) TB diagnostic guideline.</title><p>Scheme depicting the TB diagnostic algorithm in Indonesia.
