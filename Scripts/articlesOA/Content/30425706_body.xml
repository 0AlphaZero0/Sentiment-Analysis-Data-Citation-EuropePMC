<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2016, an estimated 10.4 million people developed tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. Although effective diagnosis and treatment saved about 53 million lives between 2000 and 2016, TB remains a major threat worldwide: 16% of TB cases die from the disease, corresponding to 1.7 million deaths in 2016 (<xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). Among those who are cured successfully, residual pulmonary impairment is common. Various studies have looked at lung function in patients with a known history of TB; they found abnormal lung function in 34 &#x02013; 94% of patients, varying in severity from mild to severe (<xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">Willcox and Ferguson, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Plit et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">de Valliere and Barker, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Vecino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akkara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Baez-Saldana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">de la Mora et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Nihues Sde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Manji et al., 2016</xref>). It results in considerable medical costs (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Jordan et al., 2010</xref>) and decreased quality of life (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">de la Mora et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Impaired lung function is associated with chest radiograph (CXR) abnormalities in most of the studies. It can easily be measured using spirometry, which measures air volumes and airflow rates of the lung. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximal volume of air exhaled by a patient from the position of maximal inspiration, by means of a rapid, maximally forced expiration; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is the amount of air exhaled during the first second of the FVC maneuver. The nature and severity of pulmonary impairment can be categorized by combining these two measurements: obstruction is defined as a FEV1/FVC ratio &#x0003c; 70%, restriction is suggested by a low FVC (&#x0003c;80% of the predicted value). Obstruction, low FVC, and mixed defects have all been reported in patients with previous TB.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose of Review</title><p>The aim of TB treatment is to kill the causative mycobacteria with anti-mycobacterial agents. Because of the lengthy duration of the treatment, the possibilities of drug toxicity, and increasing drug resistance, host-directed therapies (HDT), have gained attention (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Hawn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">Wallis and Hafner, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2015</xref>). HDTs are agents that can augment host defense mechanisms, modulate excessive inflammation or both, by manipulating the hosts response to a pathogen rather than targeting the pathogen itself. This may lead to improved clinical treatment outcomes such as reduced morbidity, mortality, and end-organ damage, and long-term functional recovery. Supplementing anti-TB treatment with drugs that reduce pulmonary damage could result in improved pulmonary function. To predict which interventions could be beneficial, an understanding of the pathogenesis of pulmonary damage in TB is important. What are the immunological processes leading to lung damage in humans? Where and how in the process could we intervene to prevent or reduce lung damage? How much damage is already done at diagnosis and how much still occurs during treatment?</p></sec><sec><title>What Does Pulmonary Damage in Human TB Look Like?</title><p>The established paradigm positions the caseating granuloma as the characteristic lesion of TB. However, this paradigm originates from animal studies in the late 20th century, when data on histology of human TB had become rare. Studies done before the 1950s describe two characteristic presentations in human pulmonary TB: the caseous granuloma and the tuberculous pneumonia. They divide lung pathology into primary and post-primary TB. Primary TB is the infection that occurs when people first encounter <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).</italic> Post-primary TB occurs later, as a result of reactivation of latent TB or reinfection, and causes the majority of clinical TB (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2011</xref>). The two differ with regard to their location in the lung, the host immune response and their histopathology. Primary TB typically occurs mainly in the lower zones of the lung. It is usually self-limiting but leads to consolidative pneumonia or lymphadenitis in a small proportion of individuals. It is characterized by a greater bacillary load and reduced lipid accumulation in the alveoli and the interstitium compared to post-primary TB, as well as an acute inflammatory response; cavitation however, is rare. Post-primary TB is said to develop mainly in the apices of the lung. It is characterized by obstructive pneumonia, which is frequently asymptomatic in its early stages. Endobronchial spread from the small peripheral airways can lead to necrotic caseous pneumonia, associated with progressive tissue necrosis and cavity formation or fibrocaseous disease (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2016</xref>). TB typically heals with persisting cavities, scarring, and pleural adhesions, as observed in autopsies of persons with previous TB who died of other causes (<xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">Theegarten et al., 2006</xref>). However, abnormal findings need not be present and viable TB can be found in both macroscopically normal and abnormal appearing lung tissue (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Kuhne and Willgeroth, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Chest radiographs are commonly used to visualize pulmonary damage. Radiologists distinguish primary and post-primary TB as the two typical patterns in active TB. Primary TB is characterized by lymphadenopathy and air space consolidation often in the middle or lower lobes, with or without an accompanying pleural effusion. Post-primary TB consists of consolidation and/or nodules, frequently in the upper lobes or apices of the lower lobes, with or without cavitation (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Nachiappan et al., 2017</xref>). CXRs of people with previous TB show abnormalities in 14&#x02013;100%, including fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and persisting cavities, the latter occurring more often in re-treatment patients or those with multi-drug resistant TB (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Meghji et al., 2016</xref>). All these abnormalities are associated with impaired lung function.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scans are more sensitive than CXRs, especially for imaging of centrilobular small nodules or the so-called tree-in-bud sign; these classical features of early endobronchial spread of TB are often underestimated on a CXR (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Skoura et al., 2015</xref>); [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with CT combines anatomic imaging with imaging of metabolic activity of lesions. It has been used in TB to follow the evolution of lung lesions during treatment (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Malherbe et al., 2016</xref>) and, importantly, has shown that metabolically active lung lesions may be present before the onset of clinical disease (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Esmail et al., 2016</xref>), and persist after treatment completion (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Malherbe et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>What Happens After Mtb Enters the Lung?</title><p>After <italic>Mtb</italic> enters the lung, the bacilli are taken up by alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, or occasionally epithelial cells; the latter possibly resulting in limited early bacterial growth. Infected cells start producing and secreting antimicrobial peptides, cytokines (like interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, IL-12, and IL-6) and chemokines. Other immune cells and permissive macrophages are attracted to the site of infection (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Garra et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> itself, using multiple strategies, directs the recruitment of macrophages and triggers granuloma formation (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Ndlovu and Marakalala, 2016</xref>). Secondary granulomas are formed by infected macrophages departing the primary granuloma or when a granuloma ruptures. While <italic>Mtb</italic> replicates freely in the macrophages, dendritic cells migrate to the local lymph nodes, to activate T cells. The arrival of <italic>Mtb</italic> specific T-cells in the lung usually does not happen until 14&#x02013;21 days after initiation of the infection (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Gallegos et al., 2008</xref>). Their production of TNF-&#x003b1; and interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) stimulates killing activities by macrophages. Moreover, T-cells complete granuloma formation by forming the lymphocytic cuff surrounding it (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Garra et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The balance between the eicosanoids prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) affects the mode of death of infected macrophages. LXA4 promotes macrophage necrosis, resulting in cell lysis of the macrophage, thereby allowing <italic>Mtb</italic> to escape and spread to neighboring cells. PGE2 stimulates apoptosis, leaving the macrophage plasma membrane intact, containing the bacilli, and enhancing immunity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Leukotriene (LT) B4, through regulation of TNF-&#x003b1; production (<xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Tobin et al., 2012</xref>) and possibly attraction of neutrophils (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Lammermann et al., 2013</xref>), is also involved, with both high and low levels of LTB4 inducing macrophage necrosis (<xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Tobin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In only 10% of individuals, progressive primary disease occurs; in the remaining 90% the initial infection is contained and latent infection is established (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Garra et al., 2013</xref>). Current thinking views active and latent TB on a spectrum of tuberculosis disease, rather than as two distinct disease states as historically classified. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Barry et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Granulomas</title><p>Most human granulomas are composed of a center of infected macrophages, with the ability to differentiate, for example into epithelioid cells, multi-nucleated giant cells, and foamy macrophages. An outer layer of lymphocytes surrounds these cells, and many other cells, including neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and fibroblasts may form part of the granuloma. The granuloma contains the mycobacteria, preventing their spread, but at the same time serves as a site of replication and persistence for <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Ndlovu and Marakalala, 2016</xref>). Different types of granuloma exist: cellular, suppurative, fibrotic, or caseous (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Canetti, 1955</xref>). Caseous necrosis occurs when cells within the granuloma undergo necrosis (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Garra et al., 2013</xref>); alternatively, it has been suggested that &#x02013; in post-primary TB - granulomas form in response to existing areas of necrotic caseous pneumonia (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2016</xref>). Caseous necrosis happens in conjunction with extracellular matrix (ECM) destruction. In the classical paradigm, tissue destruction occurs as a result of caseous necrosis (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Garra et al., 2013</xref>). However, an alternative theory proposes that collagen destruction precedes caseation and, therefore, ECM destruction is the initial pathological event (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Al Shammari et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Diverse types of granulomas can be present in one lung at the same time, ranging from small cellular granulomas to multiple caseous granulomas that coalesce and expel their contents to form large cavities; they behave independently of each other, and different immunologic profiles exist between (<xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Ulrichs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Subbian et al., 2015</xref>) and within (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Marakalala et al., 2016</xref>) granulomas. Granulomas can be stable, or either resolve or progress. Clinically, the behavior of a few or even a single poorly controlled granuloma can determine the outcome of the disease on a host level (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Flynn, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cavities, Bronchiectasis and Fibrosis</title><p>The lung consists of both cellular and extracellular components. The ECM is comprised of the interstitial connective tissue matrix, which forms the parenchyma of the lung, surrounding cells and providing structural scaffolding, and the basement membrane, which separates the alveolar epithelium or endothelium from the surrounding stroma. Support of the alveoli by the ECM is needed for normal lung function; destruction or abnormal remodeling of the ECM occurs in many pulmonary diseases and leads to pulmonary impairment (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Elkington and Friedland, 2006</xref>). The ECM of the lung is mainly made up of type I collagen and elastin. Type III and IV collagen are important components of the alveolar wall and basement membrane. Large fibers are connected by smaller fibrils. Dissemination of mycobacteria from the lung parenchyma into the airways as well as formation of cavities requires destruction of the ECM through cleavage of both small fibrils and large fibers. Collagens, however, are highly resistant to cleavage by proteolytic enzymes; only matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of completely degrading the ECM (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Elkington and Friedland, 2006</xref>). Consequently, MMPs play an important role in the development of cavities, bronchiectasis as well as fibrosis.</p><p>The development of cavities in TB has been studied extensively in rabbits, using <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>. In these studies, cavities developed from liquefied caseating granulomas, that contained large numbers of actively growing bacteria. Bacteria release high amounts of tuberculin-like products causing a tissue-damaging delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Dannenberg, 2006</xref>). This T-cell mediated immune reaction is important; cavities developed mainly in pre-sensitized rabbits and desensitization or immune suppression could prevent cavity formation (<xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura et al., 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura et al., 1974</xref>). Cavities are formed when expanding granulomas ruptures their caseous contents into a bronchus (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Dannenberg, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Histologic studies in humans show a different picture of cavity formation that challenges the paradigm described in rabbits (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2016</xref>): cavities do not develop from liquefied caseating granulomas, but from a caseous pneumonia. Host lipids and mycobacterial antigens accumulate in the alveoli, but only small numbers of bacteria are present. Similar to the rabbit model, sudden necrosis related to a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction against mycobacterial antigens occurs (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2016</xref>). However, an alternative yet controversial theory, based on the small numbers of bacteria observed and several observations related to autoimmunity seen in patients with TB, proposes a role for autoimmunity: mycobacteria induce inappropriate host responses to self-antigens, causing autoimmune inflammation (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Elkington et al., 2016</xref>). A considerable overlap in gene expression signatures between TB and autoimmune diseases, greater than seen with other infectious diseases, supports this theory (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The lipid-rich necrotic material in granulomas does not have the enzymatic activity to degrade collagen and consequently, its build-up is only one component of cavity formation. Extracellular matrix breakdown takes place and involves MMPs. Indeed, increased concentrations of MMPs have been found in TB cavities in rabbits (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Kubler et al., 2015</xref>) and in humans (<xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2015</xref>). Neutrophils have also been found in cavities (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Bronchiectasis, an irreversible dilatation of the bronchi, is caused by an ongoing inflammatory process (like TB), which results in damage to the airway epithelium, leading to an inability to clear secretions, as well as destruction of the elastin in the airway walls (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Milliron et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to cavity formation, MMPs have been implicated in the development of bronchiectasis, with increased levels being found in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the lamina propria of patients with bronchiectasis (<xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">Sepper et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2015</xref>). Neutrophils, together with macrophages and T-cells, are the dominant cell type in bronchiectatic inflammation (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">King, 2009</xref>). Alternatively, traction bronchiectasis can occur, secondary to scarring of the adjacent parenchyma or narrowing of more proximal bronchi (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Milliron et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Fibrosis results from the excessive deposition of components of the ECM such as collagen and fibronectin in and around inflamed or damaged tissue by myofibroblasts. Its pathogenesis is complicated (<xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012</xref>), with many innate and adaptive immune cells and cytokines playing a role. Transforming growth factor (TGF-&#x003b2;), produced by macrophages, lung epithelial cells, and fibroblasts, is one of the key players (<xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012</xref>) and indeed, higher levels of TGF-&#x003b2; in serum and BALF correlate with an increase in fibrosis seen on high-resolution CT scan in patients with TB 6 months after the start of treatment (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ameglio et al., 2005</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-&#x003b2;, and IL-17-induced neutrophil recruitment also seems to play a crucial role in the development of fibrosis (<xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012</xref>). MMPs appear to be involved: some MMPs reduce fibrosis, but others &#x02013; perhaps counterintuitively &#x02013; promote it (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Giannandrea and Parks, 2014</xref>). In a Taiwanese study, patients with an <italic>MMP-1 (-1607G)</italic> gene polymorphism, leading to excessive MMP-1 production, were more likely to have moderate to advanced fibrosis on CXR 1 year after completion of TB treatment (<xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>What Are the Immunological Mediators and Processes Leading to Lung Damage?</title><p>Much of our recent knowledge of immunological processes in TB comes from animal models. Mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, and zebra-fish have all been used to study TB. However, none of these models completely replicate the immunopathology seen in human TB. More recently, non-human primates have also been used, exhibiting a spectrum of pathology closely resembling TB in humans (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Flynn et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For this review, we included studies done in humans, where serum and BALF markers are commonly used to assess the immunological processes in the lung. Serum measurements reflect systemic responses and do not represent what happens in individual granulomas, as was shown by a difference in gene expression patterns between granuloma and blood (<xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Subbian et al., 2015</xref>). BALF more closely reflects responses taking place in the lung, however, even BALF only reflects processes taking place in the airways and not necessarily those in the lung parenchyma. Histology is the only way to assess the immunological processes occurring within a granuloma; however, histological samples are more difficult to obtain and, therefore, most study findings in humans are built on assumptions using available body fluid. Studies that do include histological samples cannot present longitudinal data.</p><p>When conducting our review, we searched for studies that assessed inflammatory mediators, and associated them with radiological abnormalities as a marker for pulmonary damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Mediators of lung damage in TB and interplay with [lightning flash cartoon], virulent <italic>Mtb;</italic> COX, cyclooxygenase; IFN-I, type I interferon; IFN-&#x003b3;, interferon gamma; IL, interleukin; LOX, lipoxygenase; LT, leukotriene; LTA4H, leukotriene A4 hydrolase; LX, lipoxin; m&#x003c6;, macrophage; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; Mtb, mycobacterium tuberculosis; neu, neutrophil recruitment; NO, nitric oxide; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

They can be secreted by a variety of cells, including macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lung epithelial cells. Their generation is tightly regulated. They are not stored requiring gene transcription immediately before secretion; exceptions being MMP-8 and -9 stored in neutrophils. Once activated, they are regulated by endogenous inhibitors, called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Expression of MMPs is increased by prostaglandin and several cytokines (including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-17 (<xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018</xref>), TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3;) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Elkington P.T. et al., 2011</xref>); hypoxic conditions, present in TB lesions, also increase expression and secretion of MMP-1 through the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Belton et al., 2016</xref>).

Their role in TB appears dichotomous: high numbers of neutrophils in the blood at the time of exposure are associated with lower likelihood of infection (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Martineau et al., 2007</xref>).

Lung damage is thought to be contributed to by their indiscriminate killing mechanisms, which can result in significant bystander damage to surrounding host tissue.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) converts AA into PGE2, while 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX) generates LTA4, which is again converted into either LXA4 by 12-LOX, or LTB4 by leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Dietzold et al., 2015</xref>). As mentioned previously, the balance between these eicosanoids influences the mechanism of macrophage death (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Macrophage apoptosis leads to an early immune response with better control of the infection and minimal immunopathology, while macrophage necrosis leads to a delayed immune response, inadequate control of infection and greater immunopathology (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Divangahi et al., 2013</xref>).

To our knowledge, no studies have correlated PGE2 or LXA4 with pulmonary function in human TB; one can speculate that tipping the eicosanoid-balance toward PGE2 may result in less lung damage. Findings in mice and latent TB in humans, however, show that levels of PGE2 were low early in the infection and increased later in and during active TB (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Rangel Moreno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Shu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).

These findings suggest that TB-related pulmonary damage might be reduced in HIV co-infected patients and the host immune response, necessary for protection against TB, is required for the development of cavities. Indeed, several of the factors previously discussed and implicated in pulmonary damage, are affected by HIV co-infection. For example, sputum levels of MMP-1, -2, -8, and -9 are reduced in HIV-TB co-infected patients, compared to patients without HIV (<xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) as is the activity and life span of neutrophils (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>).

Currently, everolimus, a rapamycin derivate, is being tested as HDT in patients with moderate to far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis (together with vitamin D, auranofin [a gold complex with antimicrobial activity used in rheumatoid arthiritis], and CC-11050 [a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor]), using rifabutin-based anti-TB treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02968927); with change in FEV1 being one of the secondary outcomes. Both rapamycin, its derivates, and vitamin D could theoretically reduce lung damage through inhibition of MMPs, although the effect of vitamin D treatment on CXR abnormalities is variable (see below). PDE4 inhibitors, in combination with INH treatment, have been shown to reduce TB-associated lung damage in rabbits (<xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">Subbian et al., 2011</xref>) and pulmonary bacillary load in mice (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Maiga et al., 2015</xref>). Doxycycline is being investigated for its potentially modulating effect on tissue destruction in pulmonary TB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02774993).</p><p><bold>NSAIDs</bold> inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), thereby inhibiting PGE2 production and enhancing LXA4 production. An adjunctive role for NSAIDs in treatment of human TB has only been shown for acetylsalicylic acid in reducing PZA-induced arthralgia (<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Petty and Dalrymple, 1964</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Horsfall et al., 1979</xref>) and possibly in TB meningitis (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Misra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">Schoeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Mai et al., 2018</xref>). Negative effects have been described: a Taiwanese study found an association between NSAID use (both traditional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors) and an increased risk of active TB (<xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is not clear whether this association is causative (i.e., decreased apoptosis at the very early stages of TB) or merely reflects an increased use of NSAIDs early during TB. In mice, inhibition of PGE2 by the NSAID ibuprofen was shown to affect lung pathology: inhibition early in the disease process leads to an increase in pulmonary inflammation and pathology (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Rangel Moreno et al., 2002</xref>), whereas inhibition later during disease decreased lung pathology and neutrophil influx (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Rangel Moreno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Vilaplana et al., 2013</xref>). Increasing <bold>PGE2</bold> by early (day one post infection) administration of exogenous PGE2 (dinoproston &#x02013; normally used for induction of labor) and/or the 5-lipo-oxygenase inhibitor zileuton (used in the treatment of asthma) to IL-1 deficient mice resulted in less necrotic lung pathology by TB (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>). No studies with dinoproston or zileuton have been performed in human TB to date. A pilot study is currently investigating the effect of ibuprofen added to multi-drug resistant TB treatment on radiological improvement of TB, amongst other endpoints (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02781909).</p><p>In <italic>in vitro</italic> models, <bold>metformin,</bold> a widely used antidiabetic agent, has been shown to inhibit TNF production by monocytes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Arai et al., 2010</xref>), affect macrophage polarization (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Nadella et al., 2017</xref>), and promote autophagy (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>). It affects Th1 responses, but data are conflicting: in mice infected with TB, metformin treatment promotes the expansion of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-&#x003b3; secreting T cells in the lungs (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>), whereas in human THP-1 cells (not infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>) metformin suppressed the production of Th1-related cytokines (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Metformin use in patients with diabetes mellitus on treatment for TB was associated with decreased mortality compared to patients using other anti-diabetic drugs in two retrospective observational cohorts (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Degner et al., 2018</xref>). A retrospective cohort study of TB patients with diabetes mellitus showed that those using metformin at diagnosis and during TB treatment had fewer cavities and fewer CXR abnormalities compared to those using other anti-diabetic drugs (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>).

Their use has been associated with a reduced risk of developing active TB in some studies (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2017</xref>), but not in all (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2014</xref>). No studies have been performed in humans assessing statins in relation to pulmonary damage in TB; in mice, statins have been found to reduce lung pathology (<xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Parihar et al., 2014</xref>).

The studies were small, and most were performed in patients with multi-drug resistant TB. Aerosolized IFN-&#x003b3; in combination with TB treatment resulted in better CXR outcomes compared to TB treatment alone. This contradicts the finding in mice, where adding IFN-&#x003b3; resulted in worse pulmonary outcomes (<xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Sakai et al., 2016</xref>). The authors conclude that IFN-&#x003b3; might be beneficial as adjunctive therapy in TB, but larger trials are needed to confirm this.</p><p><bold>Mesenchymal stromal cells</bold> are tissue-resident non-hematopoietic adult progenitor cells.

In a phase 1 trial in patients with drug resistant TB, infusions of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells, 4 weeks after starting TB treatment, was safe and resulted in CXR improvement in 25/36 patients compared to 15/36 controls (<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Skrahin et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The immune mechanisms of parenchymal lung damage in human TB are complex and incompletely understood. The difference between pulmonary damage in animal models (mostly occurring as a result of primary TB) and humans (mostly occurring as a result of post-primary TB) further complicates study of this phenomenon. Processes taking place in the lung are heterogeneous, with granulomas with varying degrees of mycobacterial control existing next to each other and inflammatory cells and cytokines appearing to have different effects at different time points. MMPs seem to play an important role and consequently, inhibition of MMPs may lead to reduction in pulmonary damage, however, this remains to be proven in clinical trials. Neutrophils are another key mediator of pulmonary damage, whose recruitment could potentially be inhibited by NSAIDs. The role of other effectors is less clear and better insight into their effects over the course of TB infection and disease is needed to be able to guide potential intervention. Future studies of human TB and (host-directed) therapy should include radiographically assessed lung damage and pulmonary function as an outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CS wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
