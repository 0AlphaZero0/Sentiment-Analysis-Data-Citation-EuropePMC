<sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Not all individuals exposed to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> become infected as inferred by a lack of T cell memory response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens. Moreover, these individuals do not develop signs and symptoms suggestive of &#x02018;active tuberculosis' (TB). The majority of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected individuals remain asymptomatic with what is known as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).</p><p>Only 5&#x02013;15% of those infected will progress to active TB disease, given they have no underlying co-morbidity which would increase their risk further (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This resulted in an estimated 10.4 million new cases and 1,674 million TB deaths reported in 2016 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The remaining 85&#x02013;95% of persons with LTBI who do not develop disease indicates that the majority of those infected have a natural immunity to prevent the progression from infection to disease. Similarly, certain individuals who are highly exposed, never develop evidence of infection. This suggests that they are naturally resistant to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and can prevent infection via an innate immune response prior to adaptive immune cell priming, and are known as &#x0201c;innate resisters&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The mechanisms that underlie the resistance to infection in persons of the &#x0201c;innate resister&#x0201d; phenotype are not fully known. In the present article, we explore the possible contribution of neutrophils to innate infection resistance.</p><sec><title>Evidence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection</title><p>LTBI is defined as the presence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-specific T-cell sensitization in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of TB. Host sensitization is used as a proxy for this assumed latent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in human hosts and is measured by reactivity to mycobacterial antigens using the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) release assays (IGRAs). The TST is performed by injecting purified protein derivate (PPD) intradermally (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction occurs if the host is reactive to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens. Due to the limited <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> specificity of TST, more specific <italic>in vitro</italic> blood-based assays (T-SPOT.<italic>TB</italic> and QuantiFERON-TB Gold) were developed using early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6), culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10), and TB-7.7 as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens. These assays measure the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; release by T cells in response to the aforementioned <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> peptide antigens (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A disadvantage of TST and IGRA for the diagnosis of infection is that they are unable to distinguish between an amnestic response and persistent infection. It is therefore possible that an unknown proportion of persons who test positive in the immune assays are no longer infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Conversely, persons who test negative in the immune assays may be (i) not sufficiently exposed to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, (ii) anergic to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens used in the assays, or (iii) exposed but able to clear <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection without triggering the onset of acquired anti-<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Natural immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></title><p>While the lack of a direct assay for the determination of current infection complicates studying resistance to infection, multiple lines of evidence support human variability in resistance to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Historical epidemiological studies have long supported the concept of infection resistance as a <italic>bona-fid</italic>e biological phenotype. During an outbreak on a US naval ship, 66 sailors shared a cabin with 7 sailors who had active TB. Of the 66 sailors, 13 (20%) remained TST negative after 6 months (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Fifty-seven (55%) of 104 elderly residents with a previously TST negative result remained uninfected after being exposed for at least 12 months to a fellow resident with sputum positive TB (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). An average of 50% of close contacts of TB patients develop positive TST or IGRA tests in overcrowded living conditions or household contact studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In Uganda only 4.1% of adults (age &#x0003e; 15 years old) with close household contacts remained PPD negative (&#x0003c;10 mm for HIV- adults, &#x0003c;5 mm for all HIV+) over a 2 year follow up period (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Other studies done in individuals in environments with high exposure to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, show that 10&#x02013;20% do not become TST/IGRA positive (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In South African goldminers who have a documented high exposure to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and an estimated LTBI prevalence of 89% in 2006, 13% of the HIV-negative participants had a TST = 0 mm response (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that 5&#x02013;20% of the population may possess resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>Molecular genetics studies support the concept of resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In a highly TB endemic area in South Africa 20% of the highly exposed population remained TST negative which was stringently defined as TST = 0 mm. This phenotype is linked to a major locus, <italic>TST1</italic>, which represents T cell-independent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A genome-wide association study in HIV-infected persons identified a locus on chromosome region 5q31.1 in proximity of <italic>IL9</italic> which significantly associates with TST positivity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, the study replicated associations in the region of <italic>TST1</italic> as well as on chromosome regions 2q21-2q24 and 5p13-5q22 that had been identified by genome-wide linkage analysis of Ugandan families (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Current genetic evidence suggests that the resistance phenotype is likely due to a combination of genetic variants synergistically contributing to the phenotype rather than a single genetic variant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The heterogeneous nature of neutrophils</title><p>It is tempting to speculate that neutrophils of individuals who exhibit <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance are a unique subset of cells genetically or epigenetically programmed to control infection and inflammation. Epigenetic reprogramming of neutrophils offers an attractive avenue of investigation as neutrophils show increased variability in both gene expression and DNA methylation compared to phenotypically na&#x000ef;ve T-cells and classic monocytes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This observation supports the concept of physiologically distinct inter-individual neutrophil populations.</p><p>Different intra-individual neutrophil subsets have also been defined in multiple studies investigating various diseases including cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), TB, and HIV-1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the heterogeneous nature of neutrophils with subsets displaying functional as well as phenotypic differences is still under debate and most subsets remain incompletely defined and phenotyped (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Genetic variants, which underlie epigenetic and transcriptional variability, also contribute to differences in neutrophil activity. For example, 21 neutrophil genes showed significant differences in expression levels between males and females while a SNP in <italic>SELL</italic>, which encodes the CD62L receptor, strongly influenced expression levels of CD62L cell receptors on neutrophils (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Not surprisingly, genes of the inflammasome pathway are significantly enriched in neutrophils and play an important role in the regulation of interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent cytokine production (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In murine studies, IL-1 deficiency predisposes to a lack of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection control and non-resolving inflammation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). During persistent infections, such as active TB, inflammasome activation correlates with pathology (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that if neutrophils contribute to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance the effector mechanisms involved are likely to be under both genetic and epigenetic regulation. However, at least some of the underlying variability may be ascribed to the inherent difficulties in working with these cells since they cannot be cryopreserved, are easily activated and are short-lived (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Possible genetic variability is further highlighted by the conflicting results published around the role of neutrophils in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Neutrophils in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection and disease</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is an airborne pathogen and is transmitted via the aerosol inhalation of transmitted droplets containing the bacteria from an infected individual. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> enters the airways and reaches the pulmonary alveolus where some of the first cells encountered are resident alveolar macrophages (AM) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) which release pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-1&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). If this first line of defense fails, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> enters the pulmonary interstitial tissue by either using the infected AM as a host vehicle to migrate or by infecting the epithelium or pneumocytes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Acute inflammatory signals are released and the other phagocytes are recruited to the site of infection. Local tissue macrophages recognize <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by Toll-like receptors (TLR) and are also activated to release pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-6, and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first cells to encounter <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> after inhalation of the bacillus. Acute pro-inflammatory signals are released by AM and local tissue macrophages to recruit neutrophils to the site of infection.<bold>(B)</bold> Neutrophils use a variety of mechanisms to mediate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. These included phagocytosis, degranulation, ROS formation and NET release. NETs transfer Hsp72 to adjacent macrophages inducing a pro-inflammatory response.<bold>(C)</bold> Interaction of recruited neutrophils with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mediates the activation of several pathways which contribute to inflammation and clearance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) release is mostly mediated in an inflammasome dependent manner. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) induces NF-&#x003ba;B which mediates the induction of gene expression of IL-1&#x003b2; in neutrophils. Interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) may also regulate the release of IL-1&#x003b2;. IL-1&#x003b2; is a key player in mediating the release of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) both of which contribute to inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils. <bold>(D)</bold> PGE<sub>2</sub> eventually becomes a stop signal and has a negative feedback on cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). The production of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is favoured. In addition, AnnexinA1 (ANX1) stimulates IL-10 release by macrophages. Neutrophils express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which has a further negative feedback on IL-1&#x003b2; release. The net effect is an increase in neutrophil apoptosis and clearance by tissue macrophages. More macrophages are recruited and further neutrophil recruitment is inhibited and inflammation is resolved.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-09-02637-g0001"/></fig><p>Neutrophils are some of the first phagocytes recruited from the pulmonary vasculature to the pulmonary interstitium (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Multiple receptors (including TLRs and C-type lectins receptors (CLRs) and cytokine receptors) have been implicated in the interaction between neutrophils, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Upon exposure to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> neutrophil blood counts in human pulmonary TB (PTB) contacts are initially higher than in unexposed control subjects and subside after 6 weeks (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Interestingly, low neutrophil counts are associated with IGRA positivity in TB contacts (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The initial neutrophil peak seen in TB contacts, implicates neutrophils in the acute inflammatory response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Individuals in contact with patients with pulmonary TB are less likely to be infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> if they have higher peripheral blood neutrophil counts (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). One hour after <italic>in vitro</italic> infection with virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and stimulation with TNF, neutrophils suppressed the growth of the inoculum by 50&#x02013;95% (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Unstimulated neutrophils inhibit on average 40.6% of the growth of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inoculum. Interestingly, there was significant variability in this mycobactericidal capacity between donor neutrophils. Neutrophils from some donors were capable of inhibiting <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth spontaneously while, despite the addition of TNF or IFN-&#x003b3;, others were not. Neutrophil-depleted whole blood had a 3.1 fold decreased capacity to control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This finding was recently confirmed and highlights the importance of neutrophils in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Granulocyte (CD15+) depleted blood does not control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection as efficiently as blood depleted of CD4+, CD8+, or CD14+ cells. Addition of viable CD15+ granulocytes significantly improved <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> control (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>However, infection in highly susceptible strains of mice shows the detrimental effect of uncontrolled neutrophil recruitment on TB infection and inflammation control and eventually an increase in TB disease severity (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Most studies concur that neutrophils are final mediators of lung damage and disease (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). C57BL/6 mice with neutrophil and monocyte derived-cells lacking <italic>Atg5</italic> succumb after 30&#x02013;40 days post <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection due to a massive influx of neutrophils, and increased lesion number and bacterial load, that is not observed in wild type mice (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Whilst ATG5 is normally associated with autophagy, the neutrophilic influx associated with premature death was independent of any autophagic response. Granulomas of various susceptible mouse strains contain a substantial number of necrotic neutrophils (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) in comparison to more &#x0201c;resistant&#x0201d; mouse strains showing only scattered neutrophils and little or no necrosis (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>In humans, as in the mouse model, necrotic neutrophils are unable to control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Phagocytosis of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced necrotic neutrophils by macrophages promotes bacterial growth (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mostly remains encapsulated in apoptotic neutrophils (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). This enables fusion of neutrophil granular contents with macrophage lysosomes after efferocytosis of the apoptotic neutrophil by the macrophage (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The neutrophil membranes surrounding <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> prevent direct contact between the bacillus and the macrophage phagosomal membrane thus preventing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inhibition of phagolysosome maturation (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). However, during neutrophil necrosis, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is released from the disintegrated phagosome and enters the phagocytosing macrophage as extracellular bacteria (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Once phagocytosed by a macrophage, the bacillus is able to evade phagolysosomal fusion in the macrophage and mycobacterial growth is promoted (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>).</p><p>Necrotic neutrophils added to whole blood increased the metabolism of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as measured by mycobacterial luminescence, and released IL-10 as well as growth factors, granulocyte- and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF), and the monocyte chemotactic protein chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The predominant role of these molecules is to attract and prime more cells (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). G-CSF supports the growth and proliferation of neutrophils and their precursors (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). GM-CSF has the potential to act on earlier progenitor cells than G-CSF and therefore neutrophil progenitors as well as monocytes proliferate (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). G-CSF and GM-CSF not only drive the increased production of neutrophils and monocytes but also have the ability to indirectly affect neutrophil function and phenotype (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Both of these growth factors delay neutrophil apoptosis and &#x0201c;prime&#x0201d; neutrophils for enhanced oxidative effects that can lead to tissue destruction (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). In a setting where <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> induces necrotic cell death, the newly released cells would undergo the same cycle of necrosis, release tissue damaging substances, recruit more cells, and contribute to continuous inflammation as seen in TB disease, with neutrophilia being an independent predictor of TB mortality (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>).</p><sec><title>Neutrophil mechanisms to clear <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection</title><p>Despite the involvement of neutrophils in tissue damage in late stage clinical TB, they display an inter-individual ability to control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.

Proteases (e.g., elastase, cathepsin G, and protease 3), hydrolyses, antimicrobial peptides and oxidants are released. The oxidants mediate tissue breakdown by activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). These effectors do not discriminate between pathogen and host tissue and collateral damage is inevitable.</p><p>Neutrophil-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to drive <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced necrosis (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Inhibiting myeloperoxidase (MPO) derived ROS prevents neutrophil necrosis and improves efferocytosis of these cells by macrophages and therein the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Similarly, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) neutrophils are protected from necrosis after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>)<italic>. One</italic> would therefore expect an improved control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in CGD patients who are characterized by an inability to produce ROS but this does not always seem to be the case (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Indeed, CGD patients are more susceptible to active TB supporting the possible role of neutrophils in mediating <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). This view is supported by multiple studies that have shown neutrophils to be protective in control of early infection (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>The NOX2 complex is an isoform of the large family of NAPDH oxidases (NOX) and is found in phagocytes including neutrophils (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). It is an enzyme that is involved in infection and inflammation control and is activated by neutrophil chemotactic factors such as IL-8 and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) that is produced during respiratory burst contributes to neutrophil migration and subsequently retention at the site of infection (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). CGD patients have impaired neutrophil accumulation, in contrast to the increase in granuloma formation seen in CGD (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Inflammatory leukotrienes are released by neutrophils in CGD patients but due to a lack of ROS there is a lack of degradation of these leukotrienes and delayed clearance of inflammation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>).</p><p>Reactive oxygen species have been shown to affect transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>) which mediates the induction of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8 expression.

Pro-inflammatory mediators alone, such as leukotrienes and IL-1&#x003b2;, are not enough to control infection and it is likely that the overproduction thereof augments the lack of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection control in CGD patients (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is relatively resistant to the bactericidal effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated by DNA damage (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>)<sub>.</sub> However, even if ROS does not have a direct bactericidal effect on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, it still amplifies the neutrophil antimicrobial response. It does this by activating the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET, discussed in 3.1.3), stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), as well as decondensed DNA to which the contents of cytoplasmic granules adhere in a net-like structure (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>).

Genetic linkage and association studies have previously implicated cathepsin Z in susceptibility to TB (<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). A likely alternative source of cathepsin for macrophages is through the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophil material. Uptake of liposomal encapsulated cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (NE) by alveolar macrophages in mice improves antimicrobial activity against <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>).</p><p>b. Specific granules</p><p>-Cathelicidin: Neutrophils produce LL-37, the 37 amino acid biologically active C-terminal domain cleaved from the human cathelicidin propeptide (hCAP18) by proteinase 3, when infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). LL-37 has been shown to restrict growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in neutrophils (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Similarly it restricts growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in infected macrophages when hCAP18 is exogenously activated by neutrophil proteinase 3, which has only a low level of constitutive expression in macrophages (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>).</p><p>c. Gelatinase granules</p><p>-Lipocalin 2: Lipocalin 2 binds mycobacterial siderophores which scavenge iron for the bacillus in iron-limiting conditions (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Lipocalin 2 has a greater mycobacterial suppressive effect (60%) in an iron-depleted broth (10 nM iron) compared to iron-replete broth (150 &#x003bc;M Fe) of 45%. It may be more effective in the phagolysosome where the molar ratio to siderophores would be higher.</p><p>d. Neutrophil cytoplasmic proteins</p><p>Calprotectin (S100A8/S110A9): Calprotectin is known as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and is a heterodimer of S100A8/A9. It sequesters free zinc and limits mycobacterial growth (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection induces S100A8/A9 proteins. This is associated with neutrophil accumulation and exacerbated inflammation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>NET formation</title><p>During NETosis, neutrophils release their DNA contents coated in cytoplasmic and granular proteins to trap and possibly clear invading pathogens (<xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). NETosis is an alternative form of cell death, different to apoptosis and necrosis, and mediated by phagocytosis and the generation of ROS by NADPH oxidase in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Once activated, neutrophils lose their lobulated morphology (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). The nuclear membrane initially remains intact whilst the chromatin (histones and DNA) starts to decondense. Once the nuclear and granular membranes rupture, the decondensed chromatin comes into contact with the granular as well as cytoplasmic components of the cell. The NET components are released extracellularly when the cell membrane breaks (<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). The most abundant non-histone protein in NETs is NE (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). In addition to this, NETs contain myeoloperoxidase (MPO) as well as other proteins from intracellular neutrophil organelles. These include substances from the primary neutrophil granule (cathepsin G, defensins, BPI-bactericidal substance), the secondary neutrophil granule (alcaic phosphatase, lactoferrins, lysozyme, cathelicidins, collagenase), tertiary granules [gelatinase, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)]; and catalase from peroxisomes (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Other components include calprotectin, constituents of the neutrophil cytoskeleton and glycolytic enzymes (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>, <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has been shown to induce NETosis, no experimental evidence exists that NET formation improves resolution of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). However, the AMP NET components have been shown to restrict <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth as discussed earlier. Also neutrophils can assist macrophages to clear <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. During infection, NET formation and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced apoptosis occur independently. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced NETs transfer the danger signal heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) to adjacent macrophages (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). This interaction induces a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages leading to the release of IL-6, TNF, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-10. In addition to these cytokines, calprotectin is released from the neutrophil cytoplasm into NETs (<xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). IL-10 is also released as part of the anti-inflammatory regulatory response via inhibiting IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF production and downstream Th1 responses (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). It is possible that NETs play a role in trapping and localizing the infection. The sequestration of AMPs in the NET structures may also increase their effective concentrations. Furthermore; NETs contain the release of cellular contents to prevent distal tissue destruction (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Hence, NETs are potentially an effective defense mechanism that neutrophils could use to mediate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Neutrophils and the role of cytokines and chemokines in inflammation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance</title><sec><title>Initial inflammation</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection triggers TLR signaling and induces NF-&#x003ba;B which mediates the induction of gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF in neutrophils (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes and play a key role in the activation of IL-1&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). Neutrophils express components of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes (<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). The latter are found in the cytoplasm as well as secretory and tertiary granule compartments (<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). Neutrophils release IL-1&#x003b2; mostly in an inflammasome-dependent manner and do not release IL-1&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). The inflammasome subunit caspase-1 activates pro-IL-1&#x003b2; to form IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>, <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). IL-1&#x003b2; activation can also occur in a caspase-1 independent manner via neutrophil proteases; NE, and proteinase 3 (PR3) (<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). Furthermore, it is of interest that inflammasome components are found in neutrophil secretory vesicles. The components may play a role in phagosomal functionality or may be released into the extracellular environment and utilized by other phagocytes, but this remains to be proven in neutrophils (<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>).</p><p>One of the key roles of IL-1&#x003b2; is to mediate the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid. Eicosanoids are important lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid (AA) and are rapidly synthesized by phagocytes after acute challenge with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) competes with 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) or 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) for the generation of each of the different eicosanoids. During inflammation macrophages and other cells, including neutrophils, can produce COX-2, which converts AA to PGE2. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) converts AA to LTB4 from leukotriene A4 (LTA4). PGE2 and LTB4 mainly have proinflammatory effects and mediate the rapid recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection and inflammation (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>, <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>). LTB4 promotes phagocytosis and the bactericidal activity of neutrophils (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>, <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>, <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, neutrophils are a possible source of IL-12 mediated IFN-&#x003b3; release (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>). However, whether this occurs through direct <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> stimulation is unknown. Neutrophils release IFN-&#x003b3; after stimulation by degranulating agents which is due to an available small storage of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>). In addition, neutrophil stimulation by IL-12 alone or in combinations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-2, IL-18, or IL-15, induces IFN-&#x003b3; synthesis by neutrophils (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>).</p><p>Neutrophils matured with IFN-&#x003b3; have marked upregulation of multiple transcripts where Guanylate Binding Protein (GBP) showed the highest changes. GBPs are a subfamily of the IFN inducible GTPase superfamily (<xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>, <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>). GBP-5, in particular, is strongly upregulated in transcriptomes from an immature myeloid cell line (PLB-985) matured in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>). PLB-985 cells can differentiate into terminally mature neutrophils and have the ability to mimic the physiological conditions of stimulation (<xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>). The exact role of GBP-5 has not been described in neutrophils yet, but it is possible that it enhances the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1&#x003b2; production, as in macrophages (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3; may increase the half-life of neutrophils in culture by being anti-apoptotic (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>) and in this manner contributes to the pro-inflammatory state. Pathology in pulmonary tuberculosis is associated with neutrophils expressing IFN-&#x003b3; and type I IFNs (<xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>). This transcriptional signature is found in patients with active TB but infrequently in healthy individuals or those with latent TB (<xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>). Type 1 IFNs may contribute to disease progression but the pro-inflammatory effect of IFN-&#x003b3; from a neutrophil perspective may be effective for short bursts and in a setting where <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is effectively killed. The promotion of this initial pro-inflammatory state and release of TNF and IFN-&#x003b3; by neutrophils is essential to effectively clear <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The resolution of inflammation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection</title><p>Apoptosis represents a pivotal point in the control of inflammation as well as in the control of the cellular immune response (<xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>). A delicate balance exists between apoptotic cell death, clearance of apoptotic cells and ongoing inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>, <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). Not only does the efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by tissue resident macrophages prevent spillage of neutrophil content into surrounding tissue (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>, <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>, <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>), but it also decreases pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). Clearance of infection without a significant acquired immune response is favored by early killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by neutrophils, followed by apoptotic neutrophil death, and an anti-inflammatory response in the phagocytosing macrophage (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>).</p><p>A hallmark of the anti-inflammatory response is the production of TGF-&#x003b2; and PGE2, and the inhibition of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF release by the phagocytosing macrophages (<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). Studies have shown that cAMP-elevating agents such as PGE2 result in increased levels of AnnexinA1 (ANXA1) (<xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). ANXA1, a protein found in neutrophils, stimulates release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, by macrophages, and inhibits neutrophil migration (<xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>). In addition, ANXA1 promotes efferocytosis of apoptotic cells (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>, <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the release of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators, pro-resolution action is also required. Lipoxins, protectins, resolvins and macrophage mediator in resolving inflammation (maresins) are unique mediators fulfilling this duality (<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>, <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>). Rising PGE2 levels eventually act as a &#x0201c;lipid mediated class switch&#x0201d; by transcriptionally inducing 15-LO in neutrophils and shifting the production of PGE<sub>2</sub> and LTB4 in favor of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (<xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>). LXA4 decreases neutrophil-mediated tissue damage, neutrophil proliferation, and adhesion, and increases efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and IL-10 production by macrophages (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>). Resolvins, protectins and maresins are oxygenated metabolites derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that is biosynthesized from omega-3 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>). Collectively resolvins, protectins, and maresins regulate neutrophil apoptosis, efferocytosis by macrophages, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, release of IL-10 by local macrophages and tissue regeneration (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, neutrophils express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which converts the amino acid L-arginine to L-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). iNOS/NO limits the production of IL-1&#x003b2; and therefore limits further recruitment of neutrophils (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>, <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>). It is not known to what extent these neutrophil anti-inflammatory mechanisms are at play during early encounters of PMNs with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the lung (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>At first glance, the association of uncontrolled neutrophil recruitment and pathology in TB would argue against a role of these cells in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection resistance. However, neutrophils are multi-functional cells with variable roles in host defense. For example, there is documented inter-individual variability in the ability of neutrophils to kill <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> suggesting that the role of neutrophils in an early encounter with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may differ from the more integrated role in the presence of a strongly developed acquired immune response to the bacillus. As reviewed, the neutrophil has a large armamentarium of highly effective anti-microbial effector mechanisms that may come into play during the early stage of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Investigating the possible role of neutrophils in persons who remain free of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection despite documented high exposure to the bacillus offer an interesting opportunity. It may be that resisters possess a different ratio of neutrophil subpopulations, predominated by effective killers with a propensity to undergo apoptosis, compared to those who develop TB, predominated by inflammatory necrotising damage causing neutrophils. By comparing neutrophils and their anti-microbial responses from &#x0201c;innate resisters&#x0201d; with those from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection susceptible persons might illuminate if and how neutrophils play a protective role in the very stage of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Experiments along these lines will not only provide a better understanding of TB pathogenesis but also contribute to a better understanding of neutrophil biology in general.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec>
