<sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par20">Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that constitutes a major global health problem. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly in Asia and Africa, and ranks alongside human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2017, an estimated 1.7 billion individuals were newly infected with the causative agent of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, only 5&#x02013;15% of them will develop TB during their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The outcome of TB infection is affected by many factors, such as malnutrition, co-infection with other pathogens, exposure to microbes and previous vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It was reported that host genetic factors play a crucial role in determining an individual&#x02019;s susceptibility to TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recently, a number of genes potentially associated with TB susceptibility have been analysed in case-control studies.</p><p id="Par21">Studies performed in mouse models and in patients indicate an important role of interferon (IFN) during TB infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; play significant immunomodulatory roles in the protection of the host against infections. As the main mediator of the type II immune response, IFN-&#x003b3; is critical for controlling infections by intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Specifically, IFN-&#x003b3; plays a vital role in resistance to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>MTB</italic>) by activating macrophages, monocytes and Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) are IFN-inducible enzymes that play vital roles in the innate immune response against viruses. The OAS family includes OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OAS-like (OASL) protein. The <italic>OAS1</italic> gene encodes OAS1, which is an extensively characterized enzyme induced by IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors results in induction of <italic>OAS1</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. OAS1 is activated by the presence of double-stranded RNA and stimulates the oligomerisation of ATP into 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. 2-5A can bind to latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), which then dimerizes into the active form. This active form facilitates apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], attenuates proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and inhibits protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is possible that polymorphisms in <italic>OAS1</italic> influence the expression of IFN-&#x003b3;, the elimination of <italic>MTB</italic>, and ultimately affect the development of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Other OAS family members including OAS2, OAS3, and OASL also have been the focus of much research. OAS2 encodes the p69 and p71 IFN-induced isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. OAS2 play an important role in the control of bacterial infection through direct interaction with pattern-recognition receptors. It also has immunomodulatory function through immune cell receptor interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In terms of the ability to synthesize 2-5A, OAS3 shows higher activity than OAS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. OAS3 is specialized for binding long dsRNA. The major function of OAS3 during infection is to produce 2-5A activators of RNaseL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast to other OAS family members, OASL lacks any synthetic activity. OASL has the ability to regulate type I IFN responses when infected with pathogens. It has been suggested that OASL could act as a regulator in the control of antiviral innate immunity through IFN signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can regulate <italic>OAS1</italic> function at multiple levels, including expression, alternative splicing and enzyme activity. So far, among the OAS gene cluster, <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphisms have been the most studied and were reported to influence susceptibility to various diseases. For example, SNPs in <italic>OAS1</italic> have been identified as candidates for susceptibility to viral infections, such as West Nile virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Chikungunya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and measles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Previous data also indicated that <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphisms and haplotypes were potential risk factors for autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphisms were reported to be associated with respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, no previous studies have examined the association between <italic>OAS1</italic> and TB.</p><p id="Par24">Collectively, these observations prompted us to propose the hypothesis that <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphisms confer susceptibility to TB. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of polymorphisms within the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene in TB cases and healthy controls from the Chinese Tibetan and Han populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Population study</title><p id="Par25">The initial study comprised 613 patients with TB and 602 healthy controls recruited from the People&#x02019;s Hospital of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

It is possible that host genetic difference is one of the bases of TB susceptibility<italic>.</italic> In this study, four SNPs in <italic>OAS1</italic> (rs2240190, rs1131454, 10,774,671 and 11,066,453) were investigated in Chinese Han and Chinese Tibetan patients with TB. Our data showed, for the first time, that the G allele and the GG genotype of rs10774671 in <italic>OAS1</italic> were associated with TB in the two populations.</p><p id="Par40">OAS1 is an enzyme that plays an important role in innate antiviral defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This enzyme is activated by the presence of double-stranded or single-stranded RNA with a secondary structure and catalyses the oligomerisation of ATP into 2-5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These processes activate latent RNase L, which degrades viral and cellular RNA and blocks protein synthesis. In accordance with this function, human OAS1 mainly affects susceptibility to viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Given the importance of the OAS1 protein, SNPs in the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene may affect susceptibility to infectious diseases. In the present study, we demonstrated that polymorphisms in <italic>OAS1</italic> were associated with TB. It is unclear why the heightened antiviral enzyme activity in individuals was associated with TB, but this association may be explained as follows. One explanation is that the major role of the OAS proteins is as immune regulators in innate immunity, although previous studies indicated that they also play important roles in other cellular functions. The role of OAS1 in immune-related diseases has been shown by a number of association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is well known that the immune response against TB plays a critical role in the progression of <italic>MTB</italic> infection. Another explanation is that the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene affects susceptibility to TB through the type II IFN pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Type II IFN (IFN-&#x003b3;) is critical for host defence against certain bacterial and parasitic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; can activate infected host macrophages to inhibit the replication of <italic>MTB</italic> directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, OAS gene expression was regulated by both type I and type II IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A previous study suggested that IFN-&#x003b3; could increase the levels of OAS mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>OAS1</italic> gene up-regulation was observed in several gene expression signatures that differentiated active TB from latent TB infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It was also established that there was a prominent correlation between OAS expression and TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, data from Noguchi et al. revealed the potential role of <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphisms in respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we assume that the polymorphism in the <italic>OAS</italic> gene may be associated with the risk of TB infection through the type II IFN pathway.</p><p id="Par41">As a functional <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphic marker, rs10774671 was reported to be associated with disease/viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. rs10774671 is located at the last nucleotide of intron 6 in <italic>OAS1</italic>, which acts as a splice-acceptor site for exon 7. The G allele was demonstrated to allow splicing to occur leading to the production of a p46 form with high enzymatic OAS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The rs10774671 A allele usually prevents splicing at this site and thus splicing happens further downstream, resulting in the p48 and p52 forms associated with low OAS enzymatic activity. rs10774671 could also control other splice variants of OAS including p42 and p44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, the HapMap genotypic data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) of rs10774671 suggested that individuals with GG genotype had lower expression levels than those with AA and GA genotypes. However, rs10774671 GG genotype was reported to be associated with the highest enzyme activity of OAS1 in unstimulated lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The inconsistent results between mRNA expression and enzyme activity may attribute to the reason that gene expressions at the transcriptional and translational levels might be different. Our data were partly consistent with these observations, in that the G allele and GG genotype had significant protective effects against TB, whereas the AG genotype was not associated with TB. Furthermore, this result was validated in the Chinese Han population. Considering the aforementioned functional effects of rs10774671 on phenotypes, we speculate that rs10774671 could alter <italic>OAS1</italic> expression levels precluding the type I IFN pathway resulting in a protective response.</p><p id="Par42">In order to detect whether two or more SNPs interact either directly or indirectly to change TB risk separate from their independent effects, we conducted a gene-gene interaction analysis. We did not find any significant differences in single SNP analysis between cases and controls groups for rs2240190, rs1131454 and 11,066,453. However, rs2240190, rs1131454 and rs10774671 formed the best gene-gene interaction model. This result was consistent with the phenomenon that most diseases including TB are caused by multiple factors and gene-gene or gene-environment interactions are characteristic of the genetic factors. In addition, we also conducted a haplotype analysis which was based on the association between a polymorphism and the ancestral haplotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, inconsistent with the gene-gene interaction result, there was no significant association between haplotypes and TB. Since the haplotype analysis approach was used for analyzing haplotype effects at numerous closely linked loci, and the gene-gene interaction analysis could be used for analyzing the unlinked loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Only one study suggested that this genetic polymorphism was not in LD with rs10774671 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. rs1131454 (formerly rs3741981), in the evolutionarily conserved exon 3, is nonsynonymous (the G&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;A transition results in a G&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;S amino acid change). This polymorphic locus is close to the dsRNA binding domain of all OAS1 isoforms. In general, the AA, GA and GG genotypes of rs1131454 lead to low, intermediate and high OAS1 enzyme activity, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This polymorphic locus was demonstrated to be functional in the progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrated that the G allele and GG genotype were associated with TB in the Han population.</p><p id="Par44">Genome-wide association studies with longitudinal data found that rs11066453 was a significant disease susceptibility locus, as confirmed by the Health Examination cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the rs11066453 polymorphism was strongly related to <italic>OAS1</italic> mRNA expression levels in Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and the monoallelically expressed <italic>OAS1</italic> gene was also significantly associated with the gamma-glutamyltransferase level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This strong association of the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene that contains the rs11066453 polymorphism in the development and progression of human diseases may be due to it affecting <italic>OAS1</italic> expression. However, inconsistent with these findings, there was no significant association with TB susceptibility detected in the present study.</p><p id="Par45">There are several limitations in our study. First, lack of data regarding the association between other genes in the OAS cluster and TB limited our understanding of genetic mechanisms regulating the pathogenesis of TB. Second, our study lacked clinical information for the Tibetans, which limited the analysis of the association with clinical characteristics. Finally, functional validation of the included SNPs was not carried out. As a result, the true causal allele underlying the genetic association result is still unknown.</p><p id="Par46">In conclusion, we were the first to investigate the association between <italic>OAS1</italic> polymorphisms and TB in the Chinese Tibetan population and validated the results in an independent cohort. We found that rs10774671, located in the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene region is associated with susceptibility to TB in Tibetans and may act as a protective factor against TB, which was validated in the Chinese Han population. In addition, we also found that rs1131454 was a protective factor against TB in the Chinese Han population. rs2240190, rs1131454 and rs10774671 formed the best gene-gene interaction model in MDR analysis and may be considered as one of the multiple contributors to the progress of this complicated disease. However, in order to get more detailed mechanistic insight into the pathway of how OAS1 may act on TB, there is a need for further research in this field. Similar studies in different populations, gene-environment interactions analysis and functional studies are warranted to confirm and reinforce our results.</p></sec>
