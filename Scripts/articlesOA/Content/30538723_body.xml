<sec><title>Introduction: Omics and Bioinformatics in Infectious Diseases</title><p>Genomics and bioinformatics have contributed immensely to our understanding of infectious diseases: from disease pathogenesis, mechanisms and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, to host immune responses. Herein, we review some of the major contributions of genomics and bioinformatics in infectious disease research using examples of three diseases that account for large proportions of morbidity and mortality as well as a neglected tropical disease. Specifically, we review <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which causes TB, a disease responsible for approximately two million deaths globally per year. Dengue virus (DENV) causes Dengue fever, which is a re-emerging mosquito borne viral disease, responsible for more than 350 million cases annually (<xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization Western Pacific Region, 2018</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> causes malaria, a parasitic disease that accounts for the highest morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in children under five and pregnant women (<xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2018b</xref>), and Filariasis, which is a neglected tropical disease. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a circular wheel of genomics/bioinformatics as can be applied in infectious diseases as discussed herein, ranging from understanding host and pathogen genome biology to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as well as the identification of drug targets and drug resistance surveillance to patient management. This encompasses molecular techniques, bioinformatics and clinical applications (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We also highlight the application of genomics and bioinformatics to the identification of vaccine targets and drug discovery. We conclude by highlighting some challenges of conducting bioinformatics research in resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Circle of infection disease genomics/bioinformatics. This shows a representation of genomic laboratory technologies, bioinformatics analysis, and potential applications. This includes: (1) molecular techniques such as whole genome sequencing by methods like Illumina to generate sequence reads, which are needed for the (2) bioinformatics application to study host systemic responses, pathogen genomics, and transmission dynamics. Further, bioinformatics can be applied to determine genetic diversity, investigation of drug resistance mechanisms and surveillance, and the identification of vaccine targets in systems vaccinology.

The mycobacterial genome was first sequenced in 1998 and many more <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes have since been sequenced (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Guerra-Assun&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2016</xref>). These genomes provide great avenues for the genomic characterization, development of improved diagnostic tools, drug susceptibility testing, and molecular epidemiology of circulating mycobacterial strains. Host-pathogen genomics and transcriptomics have over the past decade enhanced our understanding of human-mycobacterium interactions and in the identification of potential diagnostic and prognostic markers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An understanding of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome biology is invaluable in the control of TB. The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome is GC rich and consists of about 4000 genes and, unlike other bacteria, a large proportion of its genome encodes proteins and enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>), reflecting its thick lipid cell wall. TB control is hampered by antimycobacterial resistance, multidrug resistance (MDR) and, recently, extensively drug resistant (XDR) mycobacterial strains (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Leisching et al., 2016</xref>). Genomics analysis has immensely contributed to the identification of drug resistance-conferring mutations and surveillance (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;ser et al., 2013</xref>). Whole genome analyses have demonstrated that mycobacterial drug resistance is largely attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); for example, rifampicin (RIF) resistance arises from mutations in the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene and mutations in the <italic>katG</italic> and <italic>inhA</italic> lead to isoniazid resistance (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2011</xref>). Newly characterized genetic mutations in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes have also been shown to play key roles in the emergence of antimycobacterial drug resistance (<xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Analyses of 161 drug resistant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes identified 72 genes, 28 intergenic regions and 21 SNPs with strong and consistent associations with drug resistance (<xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Genomic analysis has also identified lineage mutation rate differences and predicted the emergence of antimycobacterial resistance (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2013</xref>). A retrospective analysis of thousands of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes collected from African and European patients identified 120 resistance-determining mutations for first and second line antimycobacterial drugs, which could be valuable in developing new assays for drug susceptibility testing (<xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, genomics through the use of GWAS has been used to identify novel mutations associated with resistance to cycloserine, ethionamide, and para-aminosalicylic acid, suggesting the involvement of efflux pump in the emergence of resistance (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Coll et al., 2018</xref>). A number of genomics-based tools have been developed to detect drug resistance including Mykrobe Predictor, PhyResSE, and TB-Profiler, which are easy to use by researchers with no bioinformatics expertise and can predict drug resistance within minutes after obtaining sequences (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Coll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Feuerriegel et al., 2015</xref>). Mykrobe Predictor has a sensitivity and specificity of 82.6 and 98.5%, respectively (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>). TB-Profiler was developed using a mutation library consisting of 1,325 mutations in different genes associated with drug resistance in 15 anti-tuberculosis drugs and had more than 75% sensitivity as well as more than 90% specificity for all drugs tested (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Coll et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study evaluating the performance of these tools showed that their sensitivity ranges from 74 to 80% along with a specificity of more than 95% (<xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">van Beek et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is still a need for optimization of analysis pipelines to make them applicable in field settings where the disease burden is usually the highest.</p><p>Genomics analysis has also been used to determine the evolutionary history and spread of mycobacterial strains such as the Beijing strain, demonstrating its spread from the Far East (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Merker et al., 2015</xref>). An investigation of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transmission dynamics is important in monitoring outbreak; <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Mehaffy et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that whole genome analysis can be used to monitor infections to decipher transmission dynamics. Furthermore, genomics has also been applied to decipher transmission dynamics of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in Vietnam, suggesting that SNPs in ESX-5 type VII secreted protein EsxW could potentially contribute to enhancing transmission (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Holt et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, genomics has been applied to investigate TB outbreaks, genotyping of the outbreak associated lineages, and their evolution during the outbreak (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Jamieson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Stucki et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, analysis tools have been developed for the prediction of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> spoligotypes from raw sequence reads, and in combination with other analysis tools also determine antibiotic resistance as well as transmission dynamics (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Coll et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>). Some genomics methods can also be employed to identify mixed infections as well as infections with a single strain and have recently been applied to clinical isolates from Malawi (<xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">Sobkowiak et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has also been used to identify candidate gene variants associated with susceptibility to active tuberculosis. GWAS analyses in African patients from Ghana, Gambia, Uganda and Tanzania identified TB disease-associated SNPs located on three chromosomal loci: 18q11, 11p13, and 5q33 (<xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Thye et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">Sobota et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, GWAS studies have also been done in Europe identifying SNPs in the <italic>ASAP1</italic> gene on chromosome 8q24 and in a genomic region in which class II human leucocyte antigen (HLA II) is encoded (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Curtis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, a GWAS study in a Han Chinese population also found SNPs in mitofusin-2 (<italic>MFN2</italic>), regulator of G protein signaling 12 (<italic>RGS12</italic>) and HLA II beta chain to be associated with active TB (<xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). This highlights that host genetics play significant roles in susceptibility to active TB and may explain why some individuals remain latently infected while some develop active TB despite having similar exposure levels. Furthermore, based on host genetic variants, GWAS analysis could be applied to identify latently infected individuals who are at a high risk of developing active TB for preventative interventions. Once validated, identified SNPs can be used to develop point of care diagnostics to identify high risk people for mass preventative treatment.</p><p>Host transcriptomics are increasingly being used to understand systemic responses to infections and to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers. <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Mistry et al. (2007)</xref> were among the first to use microarray technology to study host systemic response to TB, identifying a nine gene-signature with potential for TB diagnosis. <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen et al. (2007)</xref> applied microarray analysis to investigate the host pathway biology and potential diagnostic biomarkers. Analyzing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), they found a monocyte-derived gene expression signature identifying CD64, lactoferrin and Ras-Associated GTPase-33A as potential diagnostic biomarkers, which were further validated in another independent study population in South Africa (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2011</xref>). Applying gene set enrichment analysis to microarray gene expression identified metabolic pathways such as insulin metabolism, immune cell differentiation and inflammation in TB (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Lesho et al., 2011</xref>). A neutrophil-driven interferon signature consisting both type I and type II interferon during TB was also identified using microarray analysis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>). The type I interferon pathway was also observed by <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Ottenhoff et al. (2012)</xref> identifying IL15RA, UBE2L6, and GBP4 as the main molecules involved. A 393-transcript signature for active TB and an 86-transcript signature with a potential for distinguishing TB from other inflammatory diseases were also identified (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a biosignature consisting of 27 transcript signatures to distinguish active from latent TB and 44 transcript signatures to distinguish active TB from other diseases were recently identified (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Kaforou et al., 2013</xref>). Microarrays have also been used to demonstrate that host transcriptional responses to <italic>M. africanum</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> differ following treatment (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Tientcheu et al., 2015</xref>), which could be important in the management of patients infected with the different mycobacterial strains. Furthermore, host gene expression has also been used to monitor treatment responses and predict treatment outcome, which will be valuable in testing new drug regimens and new antimycobacterial drugs (<xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). These studies prove the potential of host genomics in providing a better understanding of disease pathophysiology, prognosis and host pathway biology in response to an infectious agent.</p><p>In addition, arrays have also been applied to childhood TB, to identify signatures for active tuberculosis and a signature that distinguishes active tuberculosis from other diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, a 9-gene signature was also identified in Warao Amerindian children, further highlighting the potential of using host biomarkers for TB diagnosis (<xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Verhagen et al., 2013</xref>). Host transcriptional analysis is moving from array-based technologies to RNA sequencing and has been applied to 16 gene signatures that identified people with a high risk of developing TB 2 years before diagnosis in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Zak et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that identified biosignatures have a variable number of genes, from about 10 to more than 100, and there is very little overlap between some signatures. It will be valuable to conduct a meta-analysis of available datasets to increase statistical power and identify high confidence signatures across studies regardless of circulating pathogens and local environmental factors. In doing such analysis, confounders due to technologies, age and circulating endemic pathogens can be accounted for to give a strong as well as diagnostic and prognostic signature. These studies highlight the potential application of genomics and bioinformatics to interrogate host response for the diagnosis and prognosis of TB, which will contribute immensely to curbing TB morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Dengue Virus Research in the Era of Bioinformatics</title><p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogenic single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the flavivirus genus, which comprises other known pathogenic viruses such as West Nile, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, Omsk hemorrhagic fever and Zika virus (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Gould and Solomon, 2008</xref>). The re-emergence, evolution, diversity and geographic distribution of flaviviruses make them interesting pathogens (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Moureau et al., 2015</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of divergence times suggests that flaviviruses originated from a common ancestor (100,000 years ago) and later split into mosquito and tick borne flaviviruses about 40,000 years ago (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Holbrook, 2017</xref>). Approximately 40% of the world population is at risk of DENV infection with more than 350 million cases reported annually.</p><p>Illumina SNPs genotyping and SNPs identified through whole genome analysis have been used in case-control GWAS statistical analysis to identify SNPs that predispose or confer protection against DENV infection (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>). The DENV shock syndrome (DSS) has been shown in a GWAS analysis of SNPs in a cohort of 2008 pediatric cases to have a strong association (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-8</sup>) with the human major histocompatibility complex (<italic>MHC</italic>) (rs3132468) on chromosome 6 and phospholipase C (rs3740360 and rs3765524) on chromosome 10 (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Khor et al., 2011</xref>). Dang et al. replicated the study in 917 Thai children with DSS and confirmed that alleles rs3132468 [MHC I chain related protein A (<italic>MICB</italic>)] and rs3765524 [phospholipase C epsilon 1 (<italic>PLCEI</italic>)] predispose Southeast Asians to DSS (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Dang et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">Whitehorn et al. (2013)</xref> genotyped 3,961 confirmed cases and 5,968 controls and found that rs3132468 <italic>MICB</italic> and rs3740360 alleles <italic>PLCEI</italic> were associated with less severe phenotypes of DENV infection in both infants and adults. This implies that the effect of these SNPs could be population-specific. Other candidate genes include dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule (<italic>ICAM</italic>)-<italic>3</italic> grabbing non-integrin (<italic>DC-SIGN</italic>), C-Type Lectin Domain Containing 5A (<italic>CLEC5A</italic>), immunoglobulin gamma constant fragment receptor (<italic>FCGRIIA</italic>), Toll-Like receptors (<italic>TLRs</italic>), Tumor necrosis Factor (<italic>TNF</italic>), Interferons (<italic>IFNs</italic>), 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthase (<italic>OASs</italic>), Janus Kinase (<italic>JAK</italic>), Stimulator of Interferon Genes (<italic>STING</italic>), cytokines, chemokines, <italic>ICAM-1</italic> and tryptase 1 proteases (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic methods have been used to investigate DENV outbreaks. <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al. (2017)</xref> analyzing 92 viral genomes from DENV patients during the 2012 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, found that at least two thirds of infections went unnoticed and their analysis highlighted the scale of the epidemic spread of DENV after the outbreak. <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ahn et al. (2015)</xref> investigated the genetic variations in 8,826 nucleotide sequences of whole-genome DENV virus, and demonstrated that there was a distinctive genetic pattern between the four DENV subtypes across different regions (American, Oceanian, Asian, and Africa).</p><p>Analyses of envelope encoding nucleotide sequences from India have shown a shift from DENV subtype III to subtype IV, suggesting some level of positive selection (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Manakkadan et al., 2013</xref>). These phylodynamic methods, which indicate evolutionary process or patterns of genetic diversity of the DENV virus, have also been reconciled with the virus epidemiology so as to decrease the variation between the two methods that are mainly used to study the population dynamics or viral behaviors (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Pybus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the importance of genomics and bioinformatics in viral research, a range of tools has been developed to analyze viral genomes and make inferences (<xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Brody et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The use of RNA folding, structural predictions and functional studies has shown that genetic variation of the DENV occurs in nature due to high rates of recombination and error-prone RNA polymerases. A deleterious DENV genome was first shown by <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aaskov et al. (2006)</xref> whereby a stop codon in the envelope coding region resulted in a defective DENV. <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2011)</xref> also discovered defective interfering viral particles by analyzing short fragments of DENV, suggesting that they may be part of a broader disease attenuating process mediated by the deleterious virus and the defective interfering particles are important in viral replication, thereby enhancing the overall transmission capability of DENV (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Li and Aaskov, 2014</xref>). Structural RNA predictions have implicated other elements in modulating replication of the virus, such as the downstream cyclization sequence (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Friebe et al., 2012</xref>), cis-acting elements occurring in the capsid coding region (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">de Borba et al., 2015</xref>), and elements in the promoter Stem Loop A (SLA) and non-structural protein 5 (NS5) regions (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Gebhard et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Understanding intra- and inter-host genetic diversity was previously mired with experimental and analytical methods that did not fully account for errors in viral amplifications. <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Thai et al. (2012)</xref> used various statistical approaches to correct for the artefactual mutations resulting from PCR amplifications and sanger sequencing, and showed that the genetic diversity index (Pi) of the DENV was low, ranging from 0 to 0.0013. This suggested sequence conservation, but they were able to show mixed infections and phylogenetically distinct DENV lineages present within the same host. Furthermore, genome-wide scans for patterns of intra-host diversity in DENV identified variants between genes suggesting significant differences in intra-host diversity of the virus in the Nicaraguan population (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Parameswaran et al., 2012</xref>). Functional annotation of the variants showed the impact of viral mutations on protein function, which strongly suggested purifying selection across transmission events.</p><p>Deep sequencing, RNA structural analysis and fitness evaluation have been used to determine processes that DENV employs for host specialization (mosquito or human) using RNA elements in the 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">Villordo et al., 2015</xref>). A host adaptable stem loop structure was found to be duplicated, which DENV uses to accumulate mutations that are beneficial in one host and deleterious in another host, but the duplication confers a robust mechanism during host switching (<xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">Villordo et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">Waman et al. (2016)</xref> used population genetics methods to compute the genotype diversity and evolution of 990 DENV genomes, and revealed that the DENV-2 population is subdivided into 15 lineages. Their study also indicated the presence of intra-genotype diversity and that the population structure of DENV-2 is spatiotemporal, shaped by episodic positive selection and viral recombination (<xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">Waman et al., 2016</xref>). The application of genomics and bioinformatics in the study of DENV shows the complexity of the virus biology, which can be exploited in target identification for drug discovery and vaccine development (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Guy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Low et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Progress in Malaria Genomics</title><p>Malaria incidence and mortality rates decreased by 21 and 29%, respectively, between 2010 and 2015 (<xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2018b</xref>). The genetic landscape of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the main cause of malaria, is increasingly being unraveled by using deep sequencing to identify polymorphisms and structural and copy number variations, which are fundamental for parasite evolution (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Kwiatkowski, 2015</xref>). Sequencing consortia such as the MalariaGEN improve our understanding of genomics of both the Anopheles vector and the plasmodium species<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. A recent study on genotyping accuracy using deep sequencing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parental generations and their progenies revealed that polymorphism frequencies can be used as markers of high recombination rates (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2016</xref>), which is an important contributor to enhancing immune evasion and drug resistance. Using whole genome deep sequencing and micro-array analysis, a study observed 18 deletions on regions encoding multigene families that are associated with immune evasion (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Bopp et al., 2013</xref>). The authors showed the presence of chromosomal crossovers in six of the deletions and were able to estimate mutation rates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Bopp et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Bioinformatics has contributed to our understanding of resistant mechanisms to previous drugs such as chloroquine and the emerging resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). Robinson et al. deployed next generation sequencing to investigate multi-clonality, population genetics and drug-resistant genotypes (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, WGS was used to discover that mutations in the Kelch propeller domain (K-13) are associated with ACT resistance in Cambodia (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ariey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Straimer et al., 2015</xref>).

Intra-host diversity can now be statistically characterized using the F<italic>ws</italic> metrics because sequencing platforms are able to generate read count data. Auburn et al. characterized within host diversity in 64 samples from West Africa, capturing a multiplicity of infections, number of clone ratios, clonal variation and within-host diversity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Auburn et al., 2012</xref>). Bioinformatics analysis of deep sequencing revealed large-scale genetic variations in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (86158 SNPs), and genome wide allelic frequencies, population structure, linkage disequilibrium and intra-host diversity (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Manske et al., 2012</xref>). The genetic diversity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is dependent on directional and balancing selection, whereby drug pressure and host immunity are the major selective agents, respectively (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Mobegi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Genomics has been used to discover novel malaria resistance loci in humans, which provide 33% protection from severe malaria (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2015</xref>). In Ghana, GWAS identified two unknown genetic loci associated with severe malaria: 1q32 within the ATPase Plasma Membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> Transporting 4 (<italic>ATP2B4</italic>) gene and the 16q22.2 linked to a tight junction protein known as <italic>MARVELD3</italic> (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Timmann et al., 2012</xref>). Most recently, GWAS was used in a longitudinal surveillance to detect K-13 signatures, which led to the identification of a Kelch variant that is suggested to be a potential modulator of artemisinin resistance (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cerqueira et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> pathophysiology is increasingly being explored using transcriptomics and proteomics.

It is worth mentioning that lymphedema, or elephantiasis, is one of the main features of LF and normally occurs as a result of a compromised lymphatic system (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Addiss, 2010</xref>).

Further analyses showed strong association of a mutation (M196A) in human tumor necrosis factors (TNF) receptor-II with hydrocele development, while the A288S mutation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) correlated with low ET-1 1 plasma levels and elephantiasis (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Population genetics is very important for assessing and understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of filarial diseases (<xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">Small et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 2017</xref>).

Transcriptomics analyses revealed stage-specific gene expression correlating with stage-specific pathway activation.

The gene expression patterns in irradiated L3s, laboratory-adapted L3s and those collected from mosquitoes were found to be different.

Such high throughput genomics analysis is important for understanding the biology/development, invasion, and immune evasion mechanisms of the parasite and could help improve disease control measures (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Mass drug treatment with Ivermectin (IVM) or Mectizan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Albendazole is the main strategy for filariasis control in Africa and has been going on for decades (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amazigo, 2008</xref>). However, cases of drug resistance have been reported and genomic methods are increasingly being used to investigate mechanisms of resistance. Genotyping and sequencing studies have shown an association between SNPs in some <italic>O. volvulus</italic> genes (P-glycoprotein-like protein, &#x003b2;-tubulin) and the development of resistance (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Nana-Djeunga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Osei-Atweneboana et al., 2012</xref>).

Moreover, GWAS demonstrated that reduced sensitivity of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> to IVM is accounted for by genetic drift and soft selective sweeps. Pooled next generation sequencing of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> worms collected from Ghana and Cameroon repeatedly treated with IVM and phenotypically characterized into poor responder (PR) and good responder (GR) parasites identified genetic variants that considerably delineate GR and PR parasites. One of these variants (SNP, OM1b_7179218) was common in both Cameroon and Ghana worm populations, whereas the others were country-specific (<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Nana-Djeunga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 2017</xref>). These variants were found to be grouped in quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in which published genes associated with IVM resistance were scarcely found.

This slow pace of genomics research output is due to several challenges in omics and bioinformatics research facilities in Africa; three of the major ones are briefly discussed.</p><sec><title>Inadequate Infrastructure</title><p>Bioinformatics and genomics analysis require powerful computers and a reliable source of electricity for large data storage and high throughput analyses (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">H3Africa Consortium et al., 2014</xref>). With the exception of some South African universities, most sub-Saharan African universities lack high performance computing facilities (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Karikari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Mulder et al., 2016</xref>). There is also a limitation of high-speed internet for sharing data and accessing bioinformatics databases and repositories (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Fatumo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Karikari, 2015</xref>). This hinders the application of cloud-based web services which could have circumvented the need for local high-performance computing facilities (<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Navale and Bourne, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, few research institutions in Africa have sequencing facilities and therefore resort to sequencing abroad through collaborations. Such collaborations often result in a loss of ownership of the data and resulting publications usually have the external collaborators as lead and correspondence authors. Notable efforts being made to bridge this infrastructural gap include the installation of high-performance computers (HPCs) at The Developing Excellence in Leadership and Genetics Training for Malaria Elimination in sub-Saharan Africa (DELGEME) at the University of Science Technique and Technologies of Bamako, Mali, the West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP), University of Ghana and the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to support storage and high throughput analyses of genomic data. These HPC facilities are complemented by NGS sequencing facilities at WACCBIP and MRC in addition to some institutions in East Africa such the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI-Kenya). This infrastructural development, and pressure from initiatives such as Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa), will hopefully serve as a springboard for Africa to increase her involvement in the study design, sample collection, analysis and ownership of data rather than just collecting samples for international collaborators.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of Training Opportunities and Well-Structured Bioinformatics Courses</title><p>Until the recent introduction of bioinformatics training courses by H3ABioNet, there were limited bioinformatics training courses in Africa. Such training programs were mostly short courses organized by local bioinformaticians with support from experts in the field across Africa and other external collaborators (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Gurwitz et al., 2017</xref>). Very few African universities have structured bioinformatics courses, most of these universities are South African, while some are North African and few are in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). The DELGEME, through funding from the Wellcome Trust, is also providing funding for Master of Science courses in bioinformatics, which are mostly done in South Africa. The other form of bioinformatics training is through local capacity building, which institutions organize for staff with support usually through North-South collaborations and transfer of expertise. However, the downside of short courses is that there is no mentorship beyond the course, which hinders consolidation of the knowledge gained. In addition to these, some organizations working predominantly on crop production, such as the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture Bioscience Center<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn010">10</xref></sup> and Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research institute<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn011">11</xref></sup>, offer short bioinformatics training opportunities to African scholars. Sometimes some students from Africa get training from European universities, but the challenge is that most of the trainees do not come back to join local institutions because of poor infrastructures. Furthermore, there is a disconnect between biologists and other scientific disciplines such as computer science, statistics and mathematics in most African universities. This affects multidisciplinary research, which is crucial in modern-day infectious disease research. Ultimately, the lack of well-structured bioinformatics curricula hampers the development and maintenance of highly needed experts in the field in Africa, since they often move to Europe and North America for better career prospects.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited Research Funding</title><p>A major challenge to research on the African continent is the lack of funding for biomedical research.

This ranges from understanding pathogenesis, host systemic responses and host-pathogen interactions to identification of prognostic and diagnostic markers. However, in Africa, despite the high morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases, there is limited expertise in the field of bioinformatics and hence limited bioinformatics research output in terms of publications. Thus, there is a need to strengthen training and capacity building in bioinformatics in Africa to improve infectious disease genomics and host-pathogen genomics on the continent. This can be achieved through the establishment of well-structured courses, mentorship for junior and trainee bioinformaticians and better career prospects to maintain trained bioinformaticians on the continent.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors listed contributed substantially to the intellectual, writing and editing, and approved the manuscript for publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec>
