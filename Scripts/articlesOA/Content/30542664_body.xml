<sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Of the many diseases associated with infection by the protozoan parasite
<italic>Leishmania</italic>, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) represents one of the most challenging to understand in terms of its pathophysiology. Unlike cutaneous leishmaniasis, where parasite growth and the pathological consequences of the ensuing immune response are largely confined to the site of transmission, VL is characterized by systemic spread of parasites, multi-organ involvement and a systemic response that is fatal without treatment. Systemic cytokine mediated immunosuppression

<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, T cell functional defects
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, alterations to the structural integrity of the lymphoid tissue
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and systemic coagulopathies
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> have all been proposed as mechanisms that promote parasite survival, render the host susceptible to concomitant secondary infections and/or act as negative prognostic markers. Evidence from animal models suggests that tissue specific control over immunity and immunopathology also exists, that may in part reflect extremes within the clinical spectrum of VL
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In spite of the broad impact of infection on a range of key physiological processes, a systems-wide appreciation of the underlying immune, metabolic and physiological changes associated with VL has yet to emerge.</p><p>Over the past several years, transcriptomic profiling has been adopted as a key methodology for generating an unbiased view of many disease processes. The application of transcriptomic profiling has provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of many infectious and non-infectious diseases
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and on the response to drugs, vaccines and other immunotherapeutic interventions
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. From a clinical perspective, the application of whole blood transcriptomic profiling (WBTP) opened a new era in clinical monitoring of disease, fuelled notably by the work of Chaussebel and others that illustrated its potential to provide insights into systemic disease processes and serve as a clinical tool
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, whether WBTP provides information reflecting a subset of systemic events or is an avatar of that response remains to be fully determined. Indeed, studies formally comparing whole blood with the systemic tissue transcriptome are rare
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Transcriptomic profiling in leishmaniasis has been limited to date. In human disease, this has largely focused on cutaneous leishmaniasis
<sup><xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. A single study has reported on transcriptional changes in the draining lymph node of Sudanese patients with VL before and after treatment with sodium stibogluconate, identifying a potential role for nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-regulated immune responses in treatment response
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. One study has examined whole blood transcriptional responses in healthy controls versus asymptomatic and symptomatic VL patients in Brazil
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Three studies have evaluated transcriptional changes in the spleen of hamsters infected with
<italic>L. donovani</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Here, we have applied transcriptional profiling to address key aspects of the tissue specific response to
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection in mice. We describe key differences between immune response and metabolic events occurring in the principal target organs of liver and spleen, as well as in blood, and where possible through publically available data, provide a formal comparison between the splenic response in mice and hamsters and between murine and human whole blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Bodies of the University of York and the LSHTM and the work was performed under UK Home Office license (PPL 60/4377; PPL 70/6997; PPL 70/8207).

<italic>ad libitum</italic>. Experiments reported here are derived from two cohorts of mice (designated CRACK-IT_1 and CRACK-IT_2; 20 mice per cohort, n=5 per infection time point and for time-matched uninfected controls). In CRACK-IT_1, mice (n=5) were killed by cervical dislocation at day 15, 17 and 21 post infection. Control na&#x000ef;ve mice were killed on the equivalent of day 14 p.i. for logistical reasons. In CRACK-IT_2, infected mice (n=5 per group) were killed at day 36 and 42, alongside a control na&#x000ef;ve group. All animals were killed and processed over an approximate time period of 4&#x02013;6h beginning in the morning. Tissues were aseptically removed post mortem and stored/processed as detailed below. All downstream tissue analysis was performed blinded to group by investigators not involved in animal handling.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and quantitative morphometry</title><p>Spleens and livers were embedded in OCT, snap frozen and stored at -80&#x000b0;, before preparing 7 &#x000b5;m cryosections. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. For gross morphology, sections were fixed for 5 minutes in ice-cold acetone and rehydrated by immersion for 2&#x02013;3 minutes in 90% ethanol, 70% ethanol and finally ddH

After washing, sections were stained for 45 min with AlexaFlour 647-F4/80 or isotype control (BioLegend, USA; 1:500), counterstained with DAPI and mounted in Prolong Gold. Sections were examined using a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 with a x 20 objective. Granuloma size and distribution was quantified using image analysis software TissueQuest 4.0 (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria), blind to treatment group. DAPI was used as the master channel to identify all events within the regions of interest, and clustering of F4/80

<sup>2</sup> region of interest were identified as individual sub regions of interest, and size and cell density was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue transcriptomics</title><p>RNA was isolated from tissue/blood samples and amplified via Agilent low-input Quick Amp labelling kit (Agilent Technologies). Amplified RNA was then assayed with Agilent SurePrint G3 mouse GE 8x60k microarray chips that were scanned with an Agilent C Scanner with Surescan High Resolution Technology (Agilent Technologies). The data were normalized using the percentile shift method to the 75
<sup>th</sup> percentile. Identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes between infected and na&#x000ef;ve samples was performed using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction for pairwise comparisons of infected vs. na&#x000ef;ve samples
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Where multiple probes for a single gene were present, the average expression level was used. This analysis was performed with GeneSpring software (version 9; Agilent) as a standard 5% FDR, with the variances assessed by the software for each t test performed. A 2-fold expression criteria (Log2 FC = 1)was then applied to each gene list. For DE analysis in CRACK-IT_1, a single group of na&#x000ef;ve mice were killed at d14 for comparison with samples of infected mice taken at d15, d17 and d21 p.i. For CRACK-IT_2, DE analysis was performed using matched na&#x000ef;ve samples for each tissue taken at each time point (see Results).</p><p>Gene ontology analysis was performed using GeneSpring (Agilent), and pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems). For the identification of upstream regulators in IPA, we used the z score, which reflects the extent to which known target genes are regulated in the expected direction, whereby positive z scores predict activation of the regulator whereas negative z scores predict inhibition of the regulator. z scores of &#x0003e;2 and &#x0003c;-2 are considered significant. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> was performed to identify enriched gene sets associated with each phenotype (i.e. infected at each time point vs. na&#x000ef;ve). Data were collapsed to gene set against an Agilent mouse array chip file (~24K genes) and parameters set for GSEA were: permutations =1000; permutations type = gene set (sample n&#x0003c;7) or phenotype (sample n&#x0003e;7). Putative protein-protein interactions were identified using STRING

Some minor changes were noted in groups of na&#x000ef;ve mice examined at each time point, despite confirmation of comparability in age, sex, weight and health status. To account for these minor variations, DE genes were identified by reference to time- and experiment-matched na&#x000ef;ve controls (

the DE genes identified at each time point post infection. Comparative analysis within Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated that IFN
<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, LPS, IL-1&#x003b2;, TLR4, TNF and STAT1 were amongst the highest scoring and significant upstream regulators predicted to be activated during infection (with activation z scores ranging from 2.89 to 9.5 and p values from ~10
<sup>-5</sup> to 10
<sup>-48</sup>), whereas IL-10RA and TRIM24 were upstream regulators that were predicted to be down regulated (z scores of ~-4 to -9 and p values from 10
<sup>-7</sup> to 10
<sup>-35</sup>;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). It should be noted that predictions made by IPA are based on the expression patterns of genes that are known to be regulated by different upstream regulators and do not require that the upstream regulator itself appears as DE in the data set. For example, at day 36 p.i., activation of IFN&#x003b3; was predicted by the changes in expression seen in 301 known IFN&#x003b3; target genes, consistent in this case with an observed Log2FC change in expression of IFN&#x003b3; of 3.474. IFN&#x003b3; was further predicted to interact with 694 genes (or 13.7%) of all DE genes via a mechanistic network involving 15 other regulators (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, using the Interferome database which contains expression data related to ~4000 interferon regulated genes (v2.01;
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>), 32.3% (1645/5096) of all DE genes scored as interferon inducible, of which 743 and 431 scored as uniquely regulated by Type I and II (IFN&#x003b3;) interferons, respectively (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, IL-10RA and TRIM24 were predicted to be inhibited based on the expression change of 108 and 41 genes, respectively, although in this case, neither of these predicted upstream regulators was itself DE. The 41 genes that predict inactivation of TRIM24 during
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection are shown graphically according to subcellular localisation in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>,. The lack of differential expression of IL-10RA and TRIM24 may reflect that function is not transcriptional regulated or that transcriptional regulation was below the Log2FC cutoff employed in this analysis (due to low abundance of cells expressing the gene of interest or only minor changes to mRNA abundance).</p><p>Finally, we examined expression of cytokine and chemokine genes as well as genes for their respective receptors, to provide a high-level view of immune pathways activated during infection in this target tissue (

In contrast to chemokine ligands, mRNAs for many chemokine receptors were found at lower abundance in infected mice compared to controls (e.g.

<xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Yet a comprehensive picture of the dynamic complexity of the host response has not previously been reported. Here, we provide data from a detailed transcriptional analysis of the response of BALB/c mice to
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection and compare this where possible to existing data sets from other species, including humans. This high-level overview of transcriptional changes associated with infection poses a number of important questions and provides an important additional data resource for the leishmaniasis research community.</p><p>BALB/c mice were chosen for this study due to their extensive use as an immunological model of infection and as a tool for the pre-clinical evaluation of drugs and vaccines
<sup><xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. In this and most other mouse strains on a
<italic>Slc11a1</italic> (Nramp1) mutant background, such as C57BL/6, hepatic infection is self-resolving and associated with the development of granulomatous inflammation, whereas splenic parasite load persists, often for several months, accompanied by marked alterations to organ microarchitecture
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. We selected time points when hepatic and splenic parasite burden were increasing and also to reflect the time frame over which a dichotomy in host resistance becomes apparent in spleen and liver. Where possible, we have also mined existing data to look for similarities and/or differences in transcriptional response. Whilst these comparisons are informative, some degree of caution needs to be exerted on their interpretation. Platforms used for analysis of transcriptomic changes differ (Agilent gene arrays, Illumina Bead Chip arrays, RNA-Seq), with microarrays often having more limited dynamic range than RNA-Seq. For this reason, we have not attempted any quantitative comparison in expression levels across platforms. Rather, our comparisons are drawn on the basis of comparing DE gene lists generated using standard analysis and statistical tools suited for each platform. In addition, variables such as tissue parasite load and time of infection are difficult to standardise (particularly for human disease where the time of infection is usually unknown), and with the exception of our study, data is currently restricted in most species to a single tissue site. It should also be remembered that whether comparing between tissues in the same host or across species, lists of DE genes may reflect changes due to either alterations in gene expression pattern of individual cells or due to changes in tissue cell composition. Although in some cases our results were unexpected and showed dissimilarity between experimental models and human disease, this should not be taken as an argument against the value of research in such models. Rather, it stresses that once proof-of-concept has been achieved in a model, additional validation based on human data is essential. Furthermore, such human data may form the basis for selecting an appropriate pre-clinical model for the question at hand, or indeed for engineering more refined models of novel aspects of human disease.</p><p>Splenic histopathology of infected BALB/c mice, as expected, indicated extensive remodelling of the splenic architecture and the late onset of extramedullary haematopoiesis, similar to that seen in other mouse strains
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Coincident with these changes, we observed transcriptional signatures associated with the activation of immune responses, angiogenesis and coagulation pathways. Interferon-related pathways were highly dominant. Approximately 13% of the identified DE genes were predicted to be downstream of IFN&#x003b3; signalling and ~30% of all genes were scored as interferon inducible using the Interferome database
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. IPA identified two candidate negative regulators IL-10Ra and TRIM24. IL-10 signalling through IL-10Ra (CD210) is well recognised for its role in inhibiting immune clearance of

<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>. Therapeutic interventions to target IL-10 mediated immune regulation in human VL have been posited
<sup><xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. TRIM24 is a bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulator protein that has recently been the focus of attention as a regulator of STAT3 recruitment during oncogenesis
<sup><xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> and as a positive regulator of Th2 cytokine production in Th2 cells
<sup><xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>. The predicted inhibition of TRIM24 would, therefore, be consistent with a dominant Th1 type immune response during murine EVL. TRIM24 is also observed as a target for inactivation during infection with lab-adapted H1N1influenza A virus
<sup><xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> and has been shown to be targetable using novel heterobifunctional protein degraders
<sup><xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>, suggesting that pathways controlled by TRIM24 could be further manipulated in favour of host protection.</p><p>In contrast to the murine EVL model, data generated by Melby and colleagues suggests that the immune response in hamster EVL favours a more prominent Th2 like response
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. In addition, their analysis also indicates that macrophages in hamster EVL are conditioned to respond to activation with the induction of a program of gene expression that favours amastigote growth, including
<italic>Arg1</italic>,
<italic>Ido-1</italic> and
<italic>Irg1</italic> and associated with STAT3 activation
<sup><xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. At the peak of splenic infection in our study (d36 p.i.), which we considered the best approximation of the hamster model that we could achieve based on the degree of pathology, we did not observe increased accumulation of
<italic>Ido1</italic> in murine EVL and a comparison of signature M1 and M2 genes suggested that in murine EVL, M1 activation was favoured. At a tissue level, alternate regulators of inflammation such as
<italic>Ptsg2</italic> and
<italic>Il-10</italic> appeared to be favoured in murine EVL. Upregulation of
<italic>Ptsg2</italic> (Cox2) is consistent with the enhanced production of prostaglandins in spleen cells from mice with
<italic>L. donovani</italic> infection
<sup><xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> and with the host protective effect of Cox2 inhibition
<italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>.</p><p>There has been considerable recent interest in the potential for host-directed therapies in different forms of leishmaniasis

<xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup>. Of interest, therefore, is how well pre-clinical models may predict novel approaches applicable to human VL. Our analysis showing increased mRNA abundance for a variety of checkpoint inhibitors including CTLA4, PD1, LAG3 and others (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>) supports the notion that these may be candidates for the development of immunotherapy, along with key suppressive cytokines like IL-10. In the mouse, these checkpoint inhibitors (along with many cytokines, chemokines and their receptors) have a complex pattern of temporal and tissue-specific regulation which, together with the potential for cell migration between sites, makes predictions concerning the impact of immunotherapy challenging. Some of these checkpoint targets are equally represented in mouse and hamster spleen and human whole blood e.g. LAG3 and CTLA4, whereas others show species restricted regulation. For example, IDO-1 is up regulated in hamster spleen and human whole blood, but not in any mouse tissue examined. Importantly, these diverse data as well as the clear dichotomy of expression at a tissue specific level, indicate the need to build a more comprehensive and uniform knowledge base regarding these pathways in different models and forms of human disease.</p><p>Analysis of whole blood has been a valuable tool for monitoring transcriptional changes associated with infection and even for predicting drug efficacy
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, but the relationship between transcriptomic changes in blood and tissue remains poorly understood. Pooling data across all tissues and time points, we were able to identify a 26-gene signature that was common to spleen, liver and blood during murine VL. 96% of these genes have been reported as interferon inducible, clearly indicating the dominant nature of interferon signalling during murine VL and that this common signature reflects disease in all organs/tissues studied. The value of defining signatures of this type might be to understand common pathways underlying inflammation or to provide new biomarkers that reflect the level of ongoing systemic disease that can be monitored in blood. We will further elaborate on the use of this signature to evaluate chemotherapy induced cure in murine VL in a subsequent manuscript (Forrester
<italic>et al.</italic> manuscript in preparation). The clinical value of this signature is however questionable at this stage, given the lack of similarity between whole blood transcriptomic responses observed in our study and that of humans with VL in Brazil
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. In a similar study in acute melioidosis, 26.9% of genes were similarly regulated in murine and human infection
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The reasons for this lack of similarity in VL are likely to be multiple, including the chronicity of infection, difference in pathogen (
<italic>L. donovani</italic> vs.
<italic>L. infantum</italic>), specific characteristics of Brazilian VL compared to VL on other continents
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or differing analytical methods. It would be informative, given the above discussion, to compare human whole blood from a greater range of patient populations with VL to better understand the extent of temporal and geographic diversity in the transcriptome of patients with VL. Likewise, data on hamster whole blood might help ascertain whether the blood transcriptome in this model more closely resembles that found during human disease.</p><p>Finally, a deeper understanding of subtleties of the immunopathology of leishmaniasis in different target tissues (e.g. granulomatous vs. non-granulomatous) and their relationship to gene transcriptional changes will require more in-depth analysis than that reported here, using new techniques to integrate image analysis with complex &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; and other meta data. Such approaches are fuelling significant advances in precision medicine in other fields, notably cancer and neuroscience

To facilitate the development of such approaches in leishmaniasis, we have generated a digital whole slide collection of the tissue sections generated in this study, stained with both H&#x00026;E and markers to identify myeloid cells (F4/80 and 1A8). These are available via a new network designed to support the development of digital pathology in leishmaniasis (
