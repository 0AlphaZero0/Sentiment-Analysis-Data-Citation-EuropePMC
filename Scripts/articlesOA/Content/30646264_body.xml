The PPV of the 3-gene TB score to anticipate progression to ATB is more than 3-fold higher than required according to the FIND intervention TPP.</p><p>There is an unmet need for noninvasive or minimally invasive biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials and during treatment for ATB as a proxy of lung pathology. To our knowledge, the 3-gene TB score is the first example of applying a TB signature to PET-CT data from an independent study that had not been trained on PET-CT. The studies further observed that the 3-gene TB score at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with 6-month radiological outcome. Patients with a 3-gene TB score higher than the median at time of diagnosis were 3 times more likely to have persistent lung inflammation.</p><p>The 3-gene TB score measured at the EOT was higher in those with ongoing lung inflammation, and accurately identified those who failed treatment as defined by a positive culture at the EOT. These results indicate that the 3-gene TB score may be useful in measuring lung pathology and monitoring treatment response because patients often cannot generate sputum after 6 months of treatment, and can be easily lost to follow-up when culture results take 40 to 60 days to declare negativity.</p><p>Since its publication in 2016,<sup><xref rid="zoi180175r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> the 3-gene TB score is now shown to distinguish patients with ATB from those with LTBI, other diseases, and healthy controls in 19 independent cohorts consisting of over 3000 individuals from 14 countries across all age groups (children, adolescents, and adults) with or without HIV coinfection. To our knowledge, the 3-gene TB score is the first signature demonstrated to work in an active screen study, and to demonstrate that peripheral immune response can be a reasonable proxy for ongoing lung pathology during ATB. Collectively, these results show a substantial potential for the 3-gene TB score to monitor an individual with a latent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection through progression to and diagnosis of ATB and evaluate response to treatment.</p><sec id="H2-8-ZOI180175"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations of our analysis. First, the optimal threshold for diagnosis is platform dependent (eg, microarray, RNA-seq, and RT-qPCR). Two different technologies were used (RNA-seq and RT-qPCR) across 3 different cohorts. Because there is not yet a commercially available version of the test, we do not have a universal 3-gene TB score threshold for diagnosing ATB at the time. Such a threshold can only be determined once the 3-gene TB score is ported to a point-of-care device. Instead, we chose to report specificity corresponding with 90% sensitivity in each cohort with regard to the WHO TPP for a non&#x02013;sputum-based triage test. Second, in the BASS, use of solid media instead of liquid culture and lack of radiography would arguably misclassify a number of patients. However, such a misclassification would likely bias performance of the 3-gene TB score toward the null hypothesis, leading to underestimate of its specificity. Third, only 7 of the individuals in the CTRC had failed treatment. Hence, further validation is required to better understand how closely the 3-gene TB score tracks with response to treatment. Fourth, the 3-gene TB score reliably identified progressors only up to 6 months prior to diagnosis, but not in samples beyond 6 months prior to diagnosis. It is currently not possible to say how long it takes for an individual with LTBI to progress to ATB. Fifth, arguably the correlation between the 3-gene TB score and TGAI measured in PET-CT was moderate. However, the 3-gene TB score at baseline also correlated with persistent PET-CT activity at the EOT, identifying patients with ATB who have subclinical TB. Therefore, although the 3-gene TB score moderately correlated with lung pathology, it provides additional clinically useful information that no other biomarker to date provides. Sixth, the 3-gene TB score satisfied the WHO TPP for a non-sputum-based triage test when we pooled results across the 3 cohorts. However, at 90% sensitivity there was a large variation in the specificity across the 3 cohorts. Hence, an active screen study with larger sample size is required to better estimate specificity. Despite these limitations, the results of our analyses are consistent with previously published results in more than 3000 samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI180175"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Across 3 independent cohorts in different clinical settings, the 3-gene TB score closely matches the WHO TPP benchmarks for a non&#x02013;sputum-based triage test at high NPV. The 3-gene TB score is associated with disease progression, performs well in active case finding, and tracks with treatment response and lung pathology. These performance characteristics make it a potential test for ruling out ATB and a strong candidate for monitoring the status of an individual over the course of infection, disease, and treatment.</p></sec>
