We have found that the mutant protein of single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<italic>Tth</italic>) HB8 enhances the efficiency of amplification of DNA templates. In addition, the <italic>Tth</italic>SSB mutant protein increased the specificity of phi29 DNA polymerase. We have overexpressed the native and mutant forms of <italic>Tth</italic>SSB protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified them to homogeneity. <italic>In vitro</italic>, these proteins were found to bind specifically to single-stranded DNA. Addition of <italic>Tth</italic>SSB mutant protein to RCA halved the elongation time required for phi29 DNA polymerase to synthesize DNA fragments in RCA. Furthermore, the presence of the <italic>Tth</italic>SSB mutant protein essentially eliminates nonspecific DNA products in RCA reactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is an isothermal method that amplifies circular DNA by a rolling circle mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The reaction products are high molecular weight, linear, double-stranded, tandem repeat copies of the input template that can subsequently be used for DNA sequencing, restriction endonuclease digestion and other methods used in cloning, labeling and detection. Kits that use this method for preparation of circular DNA templates for direct use in cycle sequencing are commercially available. RCA variants have been employed for the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms through ligation of circularizable DNA probes and for whole bacterial or human genome amplification via multiple-displacement amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although the utility of RCA is beginning to be accepted widely, several technical problems still remain to be solved. Perhaps the most significant is the appearance of nonspecifically amplified products. In practice, even with the most optimized reaction conditions (e.g. using modified random oligonucleotides) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), nonspecific RCA products cannot be completely eliminated, particularly in instances where complex and/or very low amounts of the template DNA are used. Nonspecific RCA products are most likely to be derived from false priming at sites where primer dimers are formed.</p><p>Recently, a heat stable SSB protein from a thermophilic bacteria, <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<italic>Tth</italic>), has been isolated and fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Bacterial SSB proteins are required for DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Most SSB proteins bind nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and prevent the formation of secondary structures. Wild-type and mutant SSB-encoding genes from <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> HB8 were cloned and the proteins they encode have undergone preliminary characterization (J.I. Inoue, manuscripts in preparation). We attempted to eliminate nonspecific RCA products by employing these heat-stable SSB proteins. We speculated that the presence of SSB protein could greatly stimulate polymerization (isothermal strand-displacement), and therefore reduce the formation of primer dimer and lead to the elimination of nonspecific RCA products. Mutated SSB proteins would be ideal candidates for such an application owing to their predicted ssDNA binding efficiency.</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate that a mutant SSB protein from <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> strain HB8 (<italic>Tth</italic>SSB) increases the efficiency of DNA synthesis and the accuracy of RCA using the bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of the <italic>ssb</italic> wild-type gene</title><p><italic>T.thermophilus</italic> genomic DNA was purchased from Takara-Bio.

The cells grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 were treated with isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 4 h. The harvested 1 g cells were resuspended in 10 ml of the buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 100 mM NaCl, and were sonicated. After removing debris by centrifugation (76&#x02009;000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 60 min), the supernatant was heated for 20 min at 70&#x000b0;C and centrifuged (76&#x02009;000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 60 min) to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was applied to the Heparin Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences, 8 ml) that had been equilibrated with the buffer containing 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 100 mM NaCl. The SSB protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1&#x02013;1.0 M). Fractions containing the SSB protein, detected by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, were collected and final concentration of 1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added to it. The solution was applied to the BUTYLl-TOYOPEARL 650S column (TOSOH, 4 ml) that had been equilibrated with the buffer containing 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 1.0 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The SSB protein was eluted with a linear gradient of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (1.0&#x02013;0 M). Fractions containing the SSB protein were corrected and diluted with the buffer containing 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol to low salt concentration (&#x0003c;0.6%). The solution was applied to the RESOURCEQ (Amersham Biosciences, 6 ml) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer for the Heparin Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column. The SSB protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1&#x02013;1.0 M). Fractions containing the SSB protein were corrected and concentrated to 200 &#x000b5;l by Centriprep Ym-10 (Amicon, COSMO-Bio). After the addition of equal amounts of glycerol, the sample was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until use.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a spectro-fluorometer (Perkin Elmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer) equipped with a temperature regulated holder. All fluorescence measurements were performed in 200 &#x000b5;l buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl and 10 &#x000b5;M &#x0025b;DNA at 25&#x000b0;C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 305 and 440 nm, respectively. Fluorescence changes of &#x0025b;DNA upon protein binding were measured and plotted against the concentration of SSB proteins. Apparent dissociation constants for the binding of SSB proteins to ssDNA were determined by fitting the actual fluorescence values to the theatrical curve.

The DNA was then fixed to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at 68&#x000b0;C in 20 ml of prehybridization solution in a hybridization chamber. The radiolabeled probes were prepared with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK), a kit (BcaBEST&#x02122; Labeling kit, Takara Bio) and pUC19 or a human gene site (3121 bp). Following addition of the radiolabeled probes, the membrane was incubated at 68&#x000b0;C for a further 12 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed with 200 ml 0.5&#x000d7; SSC (7.5 mM sodium citrate pH 7.0 and 75 mM NaCl), 0.1% SDS at 68&#x000b0;C.

The presence of <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255 mutant protein shortened the elongation time required to synthesize a DNA fragment by phi29 DNA polymerase. Such stimulation could be the result of direct interactions between <italic>Tth</italic>SSB and DNA polymerase. However, as an increase in DNA synthesis was also observed when a <italic>Bst</italic> DNA polymerase was used (Supplementary Figure S1), it follows that the effect of <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255 was not due to specific interactions with a DNA polymerase, but was most probably due to an indirect consequence of its binding to ssDNA.</p><p>There are several putative explanations for such an indirect effect on DNA synthesis stimulation since the <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255 protein showed weak binding to ssDNA. For example, the <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255/ssDNA complexes could avoid the formation of folded ssDNA structures, which are generally considered to block the progression of DNA polymerase. In addition, the primers could hybridize not only free ssDNA region but also ssDNA on the <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255/ssDNA complexes. Then, <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255 could prevent non-productive binding of DNA polymerase to ssDNA, and direct it to specific dsDNA regions where the primers hybridize, thus allowing more effective strand-displacement in the RCA reaction.</p><p>Although several groups have reported that DNA binding proteins, such as T4gene 32, enhance RCA reactions, there are no reports on the application of SSB protein for RCA where the protein reduces nonspecific RCA products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Under the conditions we employed here, the inclusion of wild-type SSB protein either from <italic>E.coli</italic> or <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> in the reaction mixture for RCA neither reduced nonspecific products nor template concentrations required for RCA. <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255 could only enhance RCA reactions drastically, which showed weak ssDNA binding affinity. This characteristic of the protein would be critical for reduction of nonspecific products. As shown in Supplementary Figure SP2, <italic>Tth</italic>SSB has a significant cluster consisting of acidic residues in its C-terminus although the role has not been cleared. Since F255P substitution is in the cluster, it may be related to a function of ssDNA binding in spite of acidic environment.</p><p>The utility of RCA-based whole genome amplification has been demonstrated for a variety of uses including quantitative PCR, SNP genotyping, Southern blot analysis of restriction fragments, chromosome painting (FISH), subcloning and DNA sequencing. The usefulness of whole genome amplification depends on its ability to give complete coverage of the genome with little regional bias, which is critical when the product is to be used for SNP genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). At extremely low template concentrations, regions of the genome are rarely lost, resulting in loss of one allele despite amplification of the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). At a considerably lower template concentration, RCA in the presence of <italic>Tth</italic>SSB-255 protein could amplify template homogeneously than conventional RCA. Therefore, this method may be applicable to a genotyping application.</p><p>Finally, the homology between <italic>Tth</italic>SSB and <italic>Taq</italic>SSB proteins is very high especially in the C terminal domain (see Supplementary Figure S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Therefore, we strongly suspect that the same effects will be achieved by the <italic>Taq</italic>SSB mutant protein, which has the mutated amino acid at the same site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
