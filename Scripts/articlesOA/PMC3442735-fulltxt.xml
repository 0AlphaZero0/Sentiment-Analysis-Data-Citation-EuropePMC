The elucidation of biological mechanisms underlying these effects is an area of active investigation. We suggest that telomere biology may represent a novel mechanism underlying the effects of a disparate set of suboptimal intrauterine exposures on various health and disease risk phenotypes. From an evolutionary-developmental perspective, energy substrate availability (i.e., nutrition) and challenges that have the potential to impact the structural or functional integrity and survival of the organism (i.e., stress) likely represent the most important environmental considerations underlying natural selection and developmental plasticity.

This direct effect requires one or more underlying mechanisms that can maintain it across the life-course. It is therefore essential to characterize the biological mechanisms through which children may acquire such lasting vulnerability to disease, namely, the mechanisms of biological embedding. One plausible mechanism may lie in changes to DNA. New research suggests that stress exposures can accelerate the erosion of DNA segments called telomeres.</p><p>In the past 2 years, six studies provided support for an association between telomere length (TL) and childhood stress. Although these studies advance understanding of the link between childhood stress and TL, almost all studies have relied on adult measures of TL and retrospective recall of stress years after the stress was experienced raising important questions about the true nature of these findings. Interpretation of findings from cross-sectional studies of TL is ambiguous in light of recent longitudinal analyses of repeated TL measurements. These recent findings indicate that the temporal process of telomere erosion is more complex than initially assumed, and that repeated measures (not just length at one time point) are needed to measure true telomere erosion in individuals who are experiencing stress. Moreover, given the elapsed time between the putative stress exposure and the measurement of TL, it has not been clear whether telomeres began eroding during stress exposure or whether erosion occurred years later, possibly promoted by the sequelae of childhood stress or other intervening variables.</p><p>In our study, we used a longitudinal design to test the effects of violence exposure during childhood on telomere erosion in a cohort of young children. We tested the hypothesis that cumulative violence exposure would accelerate telomere erosion in children while they experienced stress.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Method</title><p>Participants were 236 children (49% females; 42% with one or more violence exposures) recruited from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative UK 1994&#x02013;1995 birth cohort. Each child's mean relative telomere length was measured simultaneously in baseline and follow-up DNA buccal cells, using the quantitative PCR method for T/S ratio.</p><p>Violence was assessed as exposure to maternal domestic violence, frequent bullying victimization and physical maltreatment by an adult. We interviewed mothers (or the primary caregiver) about each exposure when the children were 5, 7, and 10 years of age and compiled a cumulative record of each child's exposure to violence. Nearly 54.2% (<italic>N</italic>=128) of the children were not violence exposed, 29.2% (<italic>N</italic>=69) were exposed to 1 type of violence, and 16.5% (<italic>N</italic>=39) were exposed to 2 or more types of violence.</p><p>To test the main hypothesis that violence exposure would accelerate telomere erosion between ages 5 and 10 years, we conducted ordinary least squares multiple regression analysis. The outcome variable was age-10 TL, controlling for baseline TL at age 5 years and sex, SES, and body mass index as covariates.</p></sec><sec id="st7"><title>Results</title><p>We first examined the effect of each type of violence exposure on TL separately. Children exposed to domestic violence showed slightly accelerated telomere erosion from age 5 to 10, compared with children who had not been exposed to domestic violence, but this change was not statistically significant (&#x003b2;= &#x02212;.059, SE=.045, <italic>p</italic>=0.196). Children exposed to frequent bullying victimization also showed slight but nonsignificant accelerated telomere erosion from age 5 to 10, compared with children who had not been exposed to bullying victimization (&#x003b2; = &#x02212;0.041, SE=0.037, <italic>p</italic>=0.274). Children who were physically maltreated did show significantly accelerated telomere erosion from age 5 to 10, compared with children who had not been exposed to physical maltreatment (&#x003b2;= &#x02212;0.085, SE= 0.037, p= 0.022).</p><p>Next, we tested the main hypothesis that cumulative exposure to violence will be associated with accelerated TL erosion. Children who experienced two or more kinds of violence exposure showed significant TL erosion from baseline to follow-up measurement compared with children who had one or no kinds of violence exposures (&#x003b2; = &#x02212;0.054, SE=0.023, <italic>p</italic>=0.020).</p></sec><sec id="st8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This finding provides the first evidence that stress-related accelerated telomere erosion in buccal cells can be observed already at young age while children are experiencing stress. Children who experienced two or more types of violence exposure between age-5 baseline and age-10 follow-up measurements showed significantly more telomere erosion, even after adjusting for confounding factors. The results of the present study add weight to the hypothesis that exposure to stress in childhood can alter biological processes in relation to telomere erosion. Methodological strengths of this study include a longitudinal design with reliable and valid prospective assessments of multiple violence exposures during childhood and repeated measurements of TL during this same developmental period.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>early life trauma</kwd><kwd>teleomere length</kwd><kwd>teleomere erosion</kwd><kwd>violence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub03"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19479</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19479</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>From sadness to senescence: cellular effects of psychiatric syndromes</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wolkowitz</surname><given-names>Owen M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mellon</surname><given-names>Synthia H.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Epel</surname><given-names>Elissa S.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Reus</surname><given-names>Victor I.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dhabhar</surname><given-names>Firdaus S.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jue</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Blackburn</surname><given-names>Elizabeth H.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_3_0001">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_3_0001"><label>1</label>University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA</aff><aff id="AF_3_0002"><label>2</label>Stanford University, Stanford, CA</aff><aff id="AF_3_0003"><label>3</label>Kronos Science Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19479</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec id="st9"><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) and other serious mental illnesses are associated with high rates of comorbid medical illnesses. Many of these comorbid conditions are more typically seen in the aged, raising the possibility that these psychiatric illnesses are associated with accelerated aging. An emerging biomarker of cell aging and of increased risk of medical illness is leukocyte telomere length, and several studies have now characterized leukocyte telomere length in MDD and other psychiatric illnesses. Fewer psychiatric studies have characterized the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that can elongate and preserve telomeric DNA, or have investigated the biochemical mediators of accelerated telomere shortening.</p></sec><sec id="st10"><title>Methods</title><p>Seven studies examining telomere length in MDD, three studies in schizophrenia, two studies in bipolar illness, two studies in PTSD, and one study in generalized anxiety disorder were reviewed, as were one study of telomerase activity in MDD and one study in schizophrenia. Additional studies in chronically stressed individuals and in individuals with histories of childhood adversity were also reviewed.</p></sec><sec id="st11"><title>Results</title><p>Shortened leukocyte telomeres have been demonstrated in MDD, bipolar illness, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder, although in some studies, only subgroups of patients (e.g., those with longer lifetime exposure to the illness, those with poor responses to treatment, or those with preexisting histories of childhood adversity) showed shortened telomeres. Leukocyte telomere shortening is correlated with peripheral indices of increased oxidative stress and increased immune activation. Two studies (one in caregivers with high depression ratings and one in unmedicated patients with MDD) reported elevated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) telomerase activity, perhaps representing a compensatory attempt by the body to preserve endangered telomeres. Preliminary data in MDD suggest that relatively low telomerase activity before treatment, and greater treatment-associated increases in telomerase activity, are associated with better antidepressant responses. This, plus the preliminary observation that PBMC telomerase activity is directly correlated with hippocampal volume (by MRI) in MDD, support emerging preclinical data that telomerase has intrinsic neurotrophic and antidepressant effects.</p></sec><sec id="st12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Telomere shortening in MDD and certain other psychiatric conditions may, at least partially, reflect chronic exposure to inflammation and oxidation. As such, it may be a bellwether of increased medical risk, or it may play a more direct causal role in accelerated aging. The interplay of telomere integrity and telomerase activity may be an important determinant of psychiatric and medical outcome. Overall, the data are consistent with the view that MDD and certain other psychiatric illnesses have systemic manifestations beyond the brain and call into question the dichotomy of &#x0201c;mental&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;physical&#x0201d; illnesses.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>teleomere length</kwd><kwd>MDD</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>oxidation</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub04"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19480</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19480</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Stress and cellular aging: what's lifestyle got to do with it?</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Puterman</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>UCSF Department of Psychiatry, San Francisco, CA, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19480</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec id="st13"><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Chronic stressors across the life course predict accelerated pathogenesis of diseases of aging and early mortality. Telomere length, the DNA-based biomarker indicating cellular aging, is a mechanism of disease development, and shortens in a dose response fashion by duration and severity of life stressor exposures. Telomere length provides an important window in understanding a life span model of the accumulation of stress on aging. Self-reported perceived chronic stress and exposure to stressful life experiences during childhood and adulthood are related to short telomeres.</p><p>While the expectation that the accumulation of life stress leads to cellular senescence, most studies indicate cross-sectional associations between life stressors and telomere length. Findings suggesting longitudinal associations between life stressors and telomere shortening are best represented in studies associating self-reported early childhood traumatic experiences with short telomeres in adulthood. Adults reporting moderate-to-severe childhood maltreatment and stressful experiences, such as divorce and parental separation, are more likely to have significantly shorter telomeres than those reporting no childhood maltreatment. To date, only one study has prospectively demonstrated associations between traumatic experiences and telomere shortening. Five-year-old children exposed to two or more traumatic stressors, including maternal domestic violence, frequent bullying victimization and physical maltreatment by an adult, have shorter telomeres at age 10 compared with children exposed to less or no violent stressors.</p><p>No studies, however, indicate prospective effects of adulthood stressors on telomere shortening over time. Perhaps, as we suggest elsewhere, chronic stressor effects on biological pathways are rarely main effects, but rather an intricate interplay between life adversity and resiliency factors. Our work, and that of others, is increasing our understanding of how psychological stress resilience, social connections, and lifestyle may moderate relationships between life stressors and health. Here, we present evidence from two studies that support our proposed model that behavioral and psychosocial resiliency can buffer the effects of stress on telomere length, both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Cross-sectionally, we tested whether multisystem resiliency &#x02013; defined as a composite of healthy emotion regulation, strong social connections, and being physically active &#x02013; mitigates previously demonstrated associations between concurrent depression diagnosis and telomere length. We found support for this model, which will be presented. In a second study we examined how a lifestyle composite might buffer stress-induced telomere shortening prospectively.</p></sec><sec id="st14"><title>Methods</title><p>Two hundred sixty-one non-smoking women between the ages of 50 and 65 were recruited for a prospective study on telomere length change over the course of the year. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was assayed at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Perceived stress, typical dietary practices, sleep quality, and exercise levels were self-reported at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 month follow-up. Seventeen questions about life events that may have occurred in the previous year were asked at follow-up, including events such as divorce, death of a family member, and job loss. Health events were not included as they may confound effects of stressors on telomere biology. Women with histories of cancer, who were premenopausal, or did not have complete self-report data were excluded from these analyses, leaving a final sample of 196 women.</p></sec><sec id="st15"><title>Results</title><p>Results indicated that perceived stress at baseline, perceived stress accumulated over the year, or accumulation of stressors over the year were unrelated to 12-month LTL, covarying baseline telomere length, age, BMI, and income level. However, findings do suggest significant interactions between markers of stress and a healthy lifestyle over the year composed of healthy dietary practices, sleep quality, and exercising. For those at one standard deviation below mean healthy lifestyle, baseline perceived stress (<italic>b</italic>=&#x02212;8.51, SE=4.05, <italic>p</italic>=.04) and accumulation of life stressors over the year (<italic>b</italic>=&#x02212;34.51, SE=15.21, <italic>p</italic>=.02), were significantly associated with shorter LTL at follow-up, covarying baseline telomere length, age, BMI, and income level. On the contrary, at one standard deviation above the mean of healthy lifestyle, stress markers were unrelated to telomere shortening over the year.</p></sec><sec id="st16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, healthy lifestyle factors and psychosocial resiliency may interrupt a cascade of harmful effects that accelerate cellular aging, diminishing the impact that chronic psychological or objective life stress has on health. From conception to death, we are exposed to stressors. And while stressors may shape the manifestation of resiliency factors, leading to an interrelated cluster, our work suggests that psychosocial resources and lifestyle factors can add up to multisystem resiliency, providing increasing cellular buffering from life stress. Without attending to such interactions, stress effects are often masked and missed.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>teleomere length</kwd><kwd>resiliency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub05"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19506</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19506</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Anxiety and depression in severely obese pregnancy: associations with gestational weight gain and birthweight</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>Rebecca M.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>O'Reilly</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Forbes</surname><given-names>Shareen</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Denison</surname><given-names>Fiona C.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>Jane E.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19506</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec id="st17"><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Obesity is associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Early-life stress, which includes both prenatal stressful exposures and childhood maltreatment, has been suggested to have an impact on the developing brain. Cognitive alterations in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders have been described in several neuropsychological domains: attention, memory (verbal, visual and working memory), processing speed, reasoning and social cognition. Recent studies suggest that the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis modulates cognitive functioning in patients with psychosis but that this association does not seem to be related to increased exposure to stressful events. We aimed to study whether early-life stress and the HPA axis are associated with a poorer cognitive performance in subjects with a psychotic disorder.</p></sec><sec id="st22"><title>Methods</title><p>We studied 46 subjects with an early psychosis (aged 18&#x02013;35 years), who were attending the Early Psychosis Program from Reus (HPU Institut Pere Mata, Spain). These subjects included three clinical populations: (1) first episode of psychosis (FEP, <italic>N</italic>=17); (2) critical period (CP, defined as a psychotic disorder &#x0003e;1 year of duration of illness, <italic>N</italic>=17); and (3) ultra high risk (UHR, subjects with prodromal psychotic symptoms, <italic>N</italic>=12). All subjects were assessed using a structured clinical interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and Comprehensive Assessment of at Risk Mental States) to obtain a clinical diagnosis. Obstetric history and perinatal stress were assessed retrospectively by parental recall, usually from the mother. Childhood maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery was administered to explore neuropsychological functioning in seven domains: attention/vigilance, speed of processing, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. This cognitive battery gives T-scores corrected for age, sex and education level. Salivary samples at different times were obtained to determine cortisol levels. Three samples were obtained the same day of the neuropsychological assessment (before, during and after the battery). The area under the curve during these three assessments was calculated. Participants were also asked to collect salivary samples on a different day at home, on waking, 30&#x02019; post-waking, 60&#x02019; post-waking, 10.00 h, 23.00 h and at 10.00 h post-administration of 0.25 mg of dexamethasone the prior evening. The cortisol awakening response was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.19.0. Spearman correlation was used to explore the association between CTQ scores, cortisol measures and cognitive domains. Wilcoxon test was used to compare ordinal and continuous data between groups. A <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 (bilateral) was considered to be significant. To compare those subjects with a poorer cognitive performance, for each cognitive domain we compared those subjects on the first quartile (25% of lower T-scores) with the rest of the sample (75% of greater T-scores).</p></sec><sec id="st23"><title>Results</title><p>In relation to cognition, subjects with perinatal stress showed significantly poorer cognitive performance in the attention/vigilance domain (<italic>r</italic>= &#x02212;0.378, <italic>p</italic>=0.015), whereas childhood maltreatment was associated with significantly lower scores in social cognition (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.365, <italic>p</italic>=0.017).

But the underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive. Recent findings suggest a key role of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis and the placental enzyme 11&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2 (11&#x003b2;-HSD2). This enzyme inactivates cortisol (F) to cortisone (E), thereby protecting the foetus from maternal F overexposure. Studies on pregnant rats show that placental 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 is up-regulated following acute maternal stress but impaired after chronic stress. Whether a similar mechanism exists in humans is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the acute stress response of salivary F (SalF) in second-trimester pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis and compared this response with amniotic fluid F, E, and the E/(E+F) ratio as an index of placental 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 activity. Since 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 is also present in the adult salivary glands, we determined salivary E (SalE) and the SalE/(SalE+SalF) ratio, as a marker for salivary 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 activity as well and examined the association of these parameters with the amniotic fluid markers of stress.</p></sec><sec id="st30"><title>Methods</title><p>Repeated saliva samples and an aliquot of amniotic fluid were collected from 34 healthy pregnant women (mean age=37.5, SD=3.9 years) undergoing amniocentesis for karyotyping.

The effects on the offspring appear initiated prenatally as lower socioeconomic position also increases risk of prematurity and small/large body size at birth. The biological mechanisms remain, however, elusive. We hypothesized that fetoplacental stress (glucocorticoid) hormone exposure might mediate the link, as we have found in first and second generation exposures to glucocorticoids in rodent pregnancy. We therefore examined associations between socioeconomic position and placental expression of placental genes involved in glucocorticoid exposure and transfer between the mother and fetus.</p></sec><sec id="st34"><title>Methods</title><p>Biopsies of placental tissue were obtained from 62 healthy (mothers age 32.2&#x000b1;[SD] years), singleton, term pregnancies (37&#x02013;42 gestational weeks) a maximum of 90 min after (vaginal or caesarian) delivery, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Placental mRNAs encoding glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD1) and 2 (HSD2), which regenerate and inactivate glucocorticoids respectively, were determined by real-time PCR.

This combination will both regenerate active glucocorticoids in placenta (with potential impact locally in placental cells and by spill-over on the fetus) and increase placental sensitivity to glucocorticoids.

In that study, loss of diurnal variation in cortisol was associated with self-reported awakenings during the night, implying an interaction with sleep disruption. This suggested that objective measures of sleep would clarify the relationship between disruption of circadian cortisol rhythms and sleep disturbance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here we recruited 101 women with metastatic breast cancer and 16 age- and socioeconomic status-matched controls. We measured sleep using full electroencephalographic (EEG), electro-oculographic, and electromyographic recordings in the clinical research center, where we were also able to draw blood samples throughout the night using a long IV line through a hole in the wall. Sleep measures were confirmed with two nights of home EEG recordings and 2 weeks of actigraphy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among 63 for whom complete cortisol and sleep data are now available, we observed a phase shift in the relationship between the peak of cortisol and wake time such that patients woke earlier than their cortisol peak. Controls woke on average 1 h 20 min before the cortisol peak, whereas patients woke 1 h 54 min before. This control&#x02013;patient difference was not statistically significant. However, among all subjects, there was a significant .38 correlation between diurnal cortisol slope and time from waking to the cortisol peak, such that those who woke earlier in relation to the cortisol peak had flatter cortisol slopes. Among the patients alone, the correlation was .43. This suggests that flattening of diurnal cortisol is associated with early morning waking. In the sample of 101, we found a relationship between misalignment of preferred and actual bedtimes and disease-free interval (DFI), the time from initial breast cancer diagnosis to date of metastasis. Shorter DFI is a strong predictor of reduced survival time. Going to bed earlier or later than preferred bedtime was associated with shorter DFIs, compared with aligned bedtime (HR=3.25, 95%CI=1.17&#x02013;8.98, <italic>p</italic>=.023, and HR=3.55, 95%CI=1.33&#x02013;9.45, <italic>p</italic>=.011, respectively).

Rhythmic diurnal changes in blood immune cell numbers reflect a redistribution of cells from the blood to other body compartments, and back into the blood. This redistribution may be critical for leukocyte maintenance and for the surveillance and effector functions of the immune system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated diurnal changes in absolute numbers of NK cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (<italic>n</italic>=48) and controls (<italic>n</italic>=19). Sleep quality was measured by home actigraphy. Leukocyte differentials were combined with flow cytometry to calculate NK cell numbers in whole blood samples obtained every 4h, starting 12 h (T1) after the midpoint of sleep on day 1 and ending 12 h (T7) after the midpoint of sleep on day 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In agreement with the literature, control subjects showed peak blood NK cell numbers at T1, with a decrease to their diurnal trough at around the sleep midpoint (T4), followed by a return to diurnal peak numbers 12 h later. Compared to controls, patients with MBC showed significantly lower peak NK cell numbers (<italic>p</italic>=0.039), suggesting an overall decrease in NK-cell-mediated immunoprotection for patients. Interestingly, among patients, higher peak NK cell numbers were associated with a longer disease-free interval (<italic>p</italic>=0.036) and higher Karnofsky Performance Rating (<italic>p</italic>=0.083, trend), collectively indicating an association between higher peak NK cell numbers and better health and functional status. Compared to controls, patients with MBC also showed a smaller peak to trough decrease (<italic>p</italic>=0.006) that suggests reduced diurnal NK cell redistribution among different immune compartments which could also decrease immunoprotection. We further investigated the relationship between sleep disruption and damped NK cell rhythms in MBC patients. Higher average wake time after sleep onset was associated with a smaller peak to trough decrease (<italic>R</italic>=&#x02212;0.38, <italic>p</italic>=0.006). The average number of awakenings was also associated with a smaller peak to trough decrease (<italic>R</italic>=&#x02212;0.36, <italic>p</italic>=0.014). In contrast, average sleep efficiency was associated with a larger peak to trough decrease (<italic>R</italic>=&#x02212;0.40, <italic>p</italic>=0.005), indicating a positive association between better sleep and a healthier diurnal NK cell rhythm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that patients with MBC have reduced NK-cell-mediated immunoprotection compared to controls and that among patients, higher NK cell numbers are related to longer disease-free interval and better Karnofsky status. Patients with MBC also show decreased diurnal NK cell redistribution compared to controls, and among patients, reduced diurnal NK cell redistribution is associated with increased sleep disruption.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>immune cells</kwd><kwd>diurnal rhythm</kwd><kwd>metastatic breast cancer</kwd><kwd>immunoprotection</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub13"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19488</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19488</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Circadian profiles of cytokines and HPA axis activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: endocrine changes and clinical improvement following treatment with timed-release tablet of prednisone</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jessup</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>University of Bristol, Bristol, UK</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19488</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Joint stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is worse in the morning and has been associated with increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and with decreased secretion of cortisol, suggesting that clinical symptoms may be related to hormonal and immune circadian variations.

Following TRT prednisone, the peak value of cortisol increased from 14.1 to 19.3 &#x000b5;g/dl, and the trough fell from 2.9 to 2.1 &#x000b5;g/dl (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). There was a close correlation between reduction of IL-6 and improvement in morning joint stiffness following TRT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These experiments cast new light on circadian patterns of cytokines and hormones in a chronic inflammatory disease.

However, the specific molecular mechanism associated with HPA axis abnormality in the brain of depressed or suicidal subjects is not clear. It is believed that abnormal HPA axis is caused by increased levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and decreased levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the brain of depressed or suicide subjects.

Over 400 monkeys were characterized on behavior and positron emission tomography imaging in response to an intruder and were genotyped for alleles for both corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors (CRH-R1 and CRH-R2). Shyam Pandey will report on gene expression for CRH-R1, CRH-R2, GR, and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in multiple brain regions of adolescents who committed suicide and in matched controls who did not. In a sample of 122 subjects, Alan Schatzberg will present data on genetic variation differences in GR and CRH-R1 between severely depressed patients (delusional and nondelusional) and healthy controls as well as on the relationship of CRH and GR alleles to mean cortisol activity collected hourly from 6 PM to 1 AM as well as from 1 AM to 9 AM. Finally, Joseph Belanoff of Corcept Therapeutics will discuss the application of medicinal stereochemistry in the development of GR antagonists with greater GR specificity and organ selectivity than those currently available.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Associations between allelic variations in HPA axis genes and behavior were observed for CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 alleles in the rhesus monkey.

However, therapy for avoidance behavior still bears many obstacles. Even though exposure-based approaches are the method of choice, they suffer from inferior patient compliance. This can be ascribed to patients&#x02019; inability to stand the high emotional load experienced during the therapeutic sessions. The situation could be much improved if (1) learning about the safety of a feared situation could be enforced, while (2) the negative effect inherent to the exposure is decreased. This would allow for the number/duration of the exposure sessions to be restricted to a minimum, and at the same time, the emotional load of the therapeutic sessions could be dampened, with direct consequences on compliance rates. So far, however, most of the treatments with anxiolytic capabilities (e.g., benzodiazepines) lead to state-dependency or amnesia, with the consequence that safety learning is attenuated, if not completely blocked.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The role of the endocannabinoid system in fear relief and safety learning was investigated in numerous animal studies employing pharmacological and genetic approaches. Behavioral experiments involved classical fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance learning, followed by extinction training and safety learning. Mice were treated with the CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist SR141716 (3 mg/kg) or the endocannabinoid uptake/degradation inhibitor AM404 (3 mg/kg). Parts of the experiments were performed with conventional and conditional mice lacking expression of CB1 receptors either in the entire brain or in distinct neuronal populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our studies revealed the following key findings: (1) Endocannabinoids play an essential role in acute fear relief, once the averseness of the test situation exceeded a certain threshold. (2) These effects are mediated via CB1 on glutamatergic nerve terminals. (3) The capacity of the endocannabinoid system is limited in highly aversive situations but can be reestablished by blocking of endocannabinoid uptake/degradation. (4) At the same time, signaling via CB1 on dopamine D1 receptor positive neurons contributes not only to acute fear relief but also to safety learning in an inhibitory avoidance task. (5) The efficiency of safety learning in this task can be improved and the risk of relapse of avoidance behavior can be reduced by pharmacological enhancement of endocannabinoid signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Drugs promoting endocannabinoid signaling via CB1 receptors may represent a new class of compounds that combine the advantages of &#x0201c;happy pills&#x0201d; (in terms of fear and stress relief) with those of &#x0201c;smart drugs&#x0201d; (i.e., facilitated safety learning), thus increasing compliance rates and success of exposure-based therapies in anxiety disorders.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endocannabinoid</kwd><kwd>fear extinction</kwd><kwd>CB1 receptor</kwd><kwd>exposure therapy</kwd><kwd>safety learning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub20"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19590</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19590</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Bidirectional regulation of endocannabinoid signaling in the amygdala contributes to activation and adaptation of the stress response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Matthew N.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Departments of Cell Biology and Anatomy &#x00026; Psychiatry University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19590</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>Endocannabinoids have been shown to be important for the regulation of multiple aspects of the stress response, although the neural circuits underlying this phenomenon are not well characterized. The amygdala is rich in cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoid content and is well seated to integrate the role of endocannabinoid signaling to the regulation of the stress response. This series of studies sought to determine the roles of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the amygdala with respect to both activation and adaptation of the stress response.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>For the first two experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were employed. For acute activation of the stress response, a 30 min exposure to restraint stress was employed, while 9 days of 30 min restraint was employed to examine adaptation of the stress response. In the third study, C57Bl/6 mice (both wild type and those deficient in the AEA degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) were employed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposure to acute restraint stress increased the hydrolytic activity of FAAH and decreased AEA content within the amygdala. Local administration of a FAAH inhibitor (10 ng) into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) reduced stress-induced corticosterone secretion, indicating that a FAAH-mediated loss of AEA signaling in the BLA contributes to activation of the stress response. Following 9 days of repeated restraint, the corticosterone response to stress habituated, and this adaptive response was reversed by local administration of AM251 (1 &#x000b5;g), a CB1 receptor antagonist, into the BLA. Consistent with this, repeated restraint stress caused an increase in 2-AG content within the amygdala, indicating that a recruitment of amygdalar 2-AG signaling is required for stress adaptation. Chronic stress exposure caused an increase in FAAH activity and a reduction in AEA content within the amygdala. FAAH deficient mice did not exhibit this reduction in AEA content and were similarly protected against the ability of chronic stress to cause dendritic expansion and spine growth within the BLA, as well as heightened indices of anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings indicate that AEA and 2-AG signaling at the CB1 receptor within the amygdala both serve to inhibit activation of the stress response. AEA appears to serve more of a tonic, gatekeeper role, the loss of which promotes activation of the stress response. Prevention of this loss of AEA signaling, through a blockade of FAAH activity, is capable of dampening the effects of acute and chronic stress. On the other hand, 2-AG signaling is recruited by repeated restraint stress to promote habituation and adaptation of the stress response. As such, a ying-yang model exists within the amygdala with the two endocannabinoid ligands serving different roles to regulate the stress response.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fatty acid amide hydrolase</kwd><kwd>endocannabinoid</kwd><kwd>anadamide</kwd><kwd>2-arachidonoylglycerol</kwd><kwd>CB1 receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub21"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19591</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19591</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Critical role of the endocannabinoid system in mediating rapid glucocorticoid effects on memory for emotionally arousing experiences</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roozendaal</surname><given-names>Benno</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19591</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>There is extensive evidence that glucocorticoid hormones impair the retrieval of memory of emotionally arousing experiences. Although it is known that glucocorticoid effects on memory retrieval impairment depend on rapid interactions with arousal-induced noradrenergic activity, the neurobiological mechanism underlying this presumably nongenomically mediated glucocorticoid action remains to be elucidated.

A few available drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) provide some benefit in the management of PTSD symptoms and have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD, but most meta-analytic reviews (Stein et al., 2006) have concluded that the benefits are minimal and there may be relatively less benefit for combat veterans (Friedman et al., 2007). Popular augmentation strategies using second-generation antipsychotic medication were also recently shown to be ineffective in the treatment PTSD (Krystal et al., 2011). Deficits in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor&#x02013;mediated eCB signaling may play a key role in the etiology of PTSD and may mediate important components of the PTSD phenotype. Therefore, we propose to enhance eCB signaling as a novel, evidence-based treatment for PTSD with the potential to prevent both the behavioral (anxiety, impaired extinction) and molecular adaptations to trauma (increased CB<sub>1</sub> receptor expression; Suarez et al., 2009) associated with PTSD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using radioligands and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging on a high-resolution PET scanner, we tested novel models of the etiology of PTSD involving these systems and their associated receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four main lines of translational evidence implicate a defect in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor&#x02013;mediated eCB signaling in the pathogenesis of PTSD.

This ability enables us to hide from a predator in the wild, but to enjoy a visit to the zoo, although the lion may look the same in both contexts. Failures in contextual processing can lead to inappropriate fear responses rooted in failures to use safety cues, consider internal states, anticipate events, or appraise them properly. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with exaggerated fear, unwanted recollection, and inappropriate emotional and social responses. We proposed that PTSD pathophysiology involves deficits in context processing and examined this hypothesis using PTSD animal model and fMRI studies in patients with PTSD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using validated animal model of PTSD, we examined fear conditioning, fear extinction and context-dependent extinction recall, and fear renewal in single prolonged stress (SPS)-exposed animals. We further examined the relationships between glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) upregulation in SPS, and fear renewal deficits were observed. Using 3T fMRI paradigm, we examined fear conditioning, fear extinction, extinction recall, and fear reinstatement in PTSD patients and trauma-exposed control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In humans, we found that fear-conditioning procedures activated fear-associated brain regions, but PTSD patients had similar fMRI activation maps to trauma-exposed controls during fear conditioning and extinction. However, they exhibited decreased responses to contextual signals of safety and danger. In animal work, we found that the SPS-exposed animals exhibited normal levels of conditioning and extinction, but specific deficits in context-dependent extinction recall and fear renewal. In &#x0201c;dismantling&#x0201d; studies, only animals exposed to full SPS and that demonstrated largest upregulation of GR in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex exhibited fear renewal deficits.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate contextualization deficits in PTSD subjects. PTSD animal model findings mirror those observed in PTSD patients and further implicate specific molecular targets in defined brain regions in contextualization deficits. Together, this set of studies demonstrates the combined power of translational research into trauma psychopathology.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>context processing</kwd><kwd>fear responses</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub26"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19605</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19605</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Toward reconsolidation blockade as a novel treatment for PTSD</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pitman</surname><given-names>Roger K.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_26_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_26_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bolshakov</surname><given-names>Vadim</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_26_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gamache</surname><given-names>Karine</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_26_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_26_0003">3</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_26_0001"><label>1</label>Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA</aff><aff id="AF_26_0002"><label>2</label>Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada</aff><aff id="AF_26_0003"><label>3</label>Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19605</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Animal research has challenged the permanency of memory by suggesting that reactivation (retrieval) of a specific memory may return it to a labile state from which it must be &#x0201c;re-consolidated&#x0201d; if it is to persist. Pharmacologically blocking reconsolidation offers the therapeutic possibility of weakening traumatic memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We have been testing the above hypothesis using systemic drugs approved for human use. In rats we employ classical conditioning consisting of pairing a tone CS with a shock US on Day 1 (acquisition), presenting the tone without shock on Day 2 (reactivation) followed by drug, and then re-presenting the CS alone on Days 3 and 10 (tests). We have also used slice electrophysiology to measure the increase in cortico- and thalamo-lateral amygdala synaptic efficacy as a result of the tone-shock association, and then decrement in this efficacy following reconsolidation blockade. In PTSD subjects, we have administered oral drug along with verbal or written narration of the traumatic event (reactivation) and subsequently measured the strength of the traumatic memory via psychophysiological recording during script-driven imagery, and/or symptom report.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In animal work, we have found that the antiglucocorticoid receptor mifepristone, the protein synthesis inhibitor rapamycin, and the alpha-2-adrenergic autoreceptor agonist clonidine all block partially reconsolidation of conditioned fear. Clonidine does so in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, rapamycin reverses the synaptic enhancement described above, providing an underlying physiological basis for reconsolidation blockade. In humans, we have found that traumatic memory reactivation plus double-blind, placebo-controlled propranolol reduce physiologic responding during script-driven imagery, and that six weekly open-label propranolol plus memory reactivation sessions reduce PTSD symptoms to a similar degree as current cognitive behavioral treatments. A double-blind clinical trial is underway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The above results show progress toward a clinical application of reconsolidation blockade, but much more needs to be done before efficacy is demonstrated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd><kwd>classical conditioning</kwd><kwd>reconsolidation blockade</kwd><kwd>systemic drugs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub27"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19509</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19509</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Brain and blood gene expression pathways associated with susceptibility to PTSD</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Daskalakis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos P.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Buxbaum</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Flory</surname><given-names>Janine D.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Guiqing</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bierer</surname><given-names>Linda M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Hagit</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yehuda</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001 AF_27_0002">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_27_0001 AF_27_0002">2</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_27_0001"><label>1</label>Department of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA</aff><aff id="AF_27_0002"><label>2</label>Department of Neuroscience, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA</aff><aff id="AF_27_0003"><label>3</label>Anxiety and Stress Research Unit, Beer-Sheva Mental Health Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19509</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>The identification of molecular post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) susceptibility pathways associated with different patterns of behavioral response to trauma is essential to an understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD and can pave the design for new treatments. Although several genes have been reported to be differentially expressed in PTSD, methodological constraints have limited the interpretation, for example, variation in the type or magnitude of trauma exposure, inter-individual genetic variation, and tissue specificity of response. Animal models are useful in delineating some of these issues. In this study, we used a unique animal model of PTSD with ecological and population validity. Adult rats were exposed briefly to predator scent stress, which mimics a threatening situation. Rats respond heterogeneously to this type of traumatic stress behaviorally and physiologically, similar to human response variability. In this model, two behavioral extremes can be studied &#x02013; vulnerable and resistant &#x02018;subtypes&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the scent of cat urine. The outcome measures included behavior in an elevated plus-maze and the acoustic startle response 7 days after exposure. Cut-off behavioral criteria classified exposed rats according to their behavioral response as those with &#x02018;extreme behavioral response&#x02019; and &#x02018;minimal behavioral response&#x02019; (MBR), with unexposed rats as controls. From the tissue obtained 24 h after the behavioral tests, basal gene expression using Illumina BeadArrays was evaluated for whole blood and three brain areas: amygdala, anterior cortex and hippocampus. For data quality control and differential expression analysis, we used R and LIMMA (as included in MeV software), respectively. Pathway analysis was performed with ingenuity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was only minimal overlap in gene expression across brain regions and gender demonstrating the existence of distinct tissue-specific susceptibility pathways in male and female rats. Among the differentially expressed genes, the ones regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (e.g., FKBP5, Per-1, and NPY) were particularly over-represented (especially in blood and hippocampus), indicating that glucocorticoid regulation is involved in vulnerability and resistance to trauma. The observed gene expression profiles may also indicate the over-representation of discrete functional biological clusters and pathways (e.g., MAPK signaling and circadian rhythm).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Glucocorticoid-related gene expression is underlying the different response pattern following trauma, with distinct regional/structural differences between male and female rats.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>susceptibility</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid regulation</kwd><kwd>neurobiology</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub28"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19604</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19604</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>A novel mouse genetic model for post-traumatic stress disorder</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rayman</surname><given-names>Joseph B.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kandel</surname><given-names>Eric R.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Department of Neuroscience, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University College of Physicians &#x00026; Surgeons, New York, NY, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19604</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arises from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular etiology of PTSD would be greatly facilitated by the development of animal models that explore gene&#x000d7;environment interaction in the context of traumatic stress. To this end, we have identified a new mouse genetic model for stress vulnerability that may provide novel insight into the neurobiology of PTSD. Our studies focus on mice that are deficient for TIA-1, a prion-related RNA binding protein that regulates the expression of multiple target genes in the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>TIA-1 KO mice and wild-type littermates are generated from TIA-1 heterozygous crosses. All behavioral (fear conditioning, open field, elevated-plus maze, forced-swim test) and electrophysiological (hippocampal field recordings) experiments are conducted in accordance with standard protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Under baseline conditions, TIA-1 KO mice are indistinguishable from wild-type controls in all behavioral and neuroendocrinological measures evaluated thus far. However, several weeks after exposure to contextual fear conditioning, TIA-1 KO mice demonstrate increased anxiety and despair-like behavior, as well as abnormal glucocorticoid production. Moreover, these phenotypes are observed predominantly in female animals. Electrophysiological studies reveal aberrant synaptic plasticity in the ventral hippocampus of knockout animals in response to corticosterone treatment, consistent with a critical role for TIA-1 in normal emotional memory formation in the hippocampus during stress. Finally, molecular data suggest that TIA-1 may regulate alternative splicing of the glucocorticoid receptor, which is known to be important for both hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity during stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TIA-1 KO mice recapitulate several key features of chronic PTSD observed in humans. Thus, our studies demonstrate that TIA-1-deficient mice represent a useful model in the study of gene&#x000d7;environment interaction during traumatic stress, and may contribute to our knowledge of the molecular basis of PTSD. Finally, because individuals with PTSD are also susceptible to substance abuse, we, therefore, discuss the utility of TIA-1 knockout mice in the study of PTSD and comorbid substance use disorders.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genetic model</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd><kwd>substance use</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub29"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19451</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19451</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Affective style and early life experiences moderate cortisol's effects on emotional learning</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abercrombie</surname><given-names>Heather C.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_29_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wirth</surname><given-names>Michelle M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_29_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jahn</surname><given-names>Allison L.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_29_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hoks</surname><given-names>Roxanne M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_29_0001">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_29_0001"><label>1</label>University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA</aff><aff id="AF_29_0002"><label>2</label>University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN, USA</aff><aff id="AF_29_0003"><label>3</label>VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19451</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Relatively little is known about how lasting qualities of the individual (e.g., traits and/or one's past history) moderate the effects of cortisol on emotional learning.

In both studies, 1 &#x00026; 2, effects were less robust in men or trended in the opposite direction, which may represent true sex differences or may be because of confounding factors, such as differences in cortisol elevations for men vs. women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our data suggest that lasting qualities of individuals, such as Trait NA or history of early separation, moderate cortisol's effects on emotional memory. Further investigation into how variation in personal traits and past experiences moderate cortisol's effects on emotional cognition is one important step in elucidating why some individuals are more sensitive than others to the detrimental (e.g., negatively biasing) effects of stress on emotional cognition and memory. These data may also inform research regarding the use of corticosteroid receptor ligands in treatment for psychopathology.

From an evolutionary perspective, it is an adaptive mechanism, as it helps to remember threatening as well as pleasurable experiences. Stress hormones are important players in the regulation of emotional memory. Specifically, in animals and in humans, glucocorticoids enhance memory consolidation of emotionally arousing experiences but impair memory retrieval. Glucocorticoid actions are partly mediated by glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex, key brain regions for emotional memory. Here, we investigated whether the BclI polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene is associated with emotional memory in healthy young subjects.

Such altered memory <italic>contextualization</italic> may develop through the effects of the well-known stress hormone cortisol on underlying memory neurocircuitry, rich in corticosteroid receptors. By binding to these receptors, cortisol induces rapid non-genomic effects followed by slower genomic effects that are thought to modulate cognitive function in various ways. Here, we tested these time-dependent effects of cortisol on the contextualization of negative versus neutral memories.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a double blind, placebo-controlled design, 60 men were randomly assigned to one out of three possible groups. 1) In the rapid cortisol group, participants received 10mg hydrocortisone 30 min before completing the &#x0201c;associative imagination task&#x0201d; (AIT), 2) while the slow cortisol group received the drug 240 min before the task. 3) A third group received placebo at both times. During the AIT task, participants were instructed to vividly imagine 30 neutral and 30 negative words in unique background pictures. Approximately, 24 h later, participants completed two surprise memory tests: cued retrieval and recognition. Crucially, to assess memory contextualization, half of the negative and neutral words were tested in intact contexts, whereas the other half of the words were tested in rearranged context combinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recognition data showed that negative memories were generally less context-bound than neutral memories. Moreover, cortisol exerted time-dependent effects on contextual dependency of <italic>negative</italic> memories: Cortisol&#x02019; rapid effects impaired contextualization, whereas cortisols&#x02019; slow effects enhanced negative memory contextualization. In contrast, neutral memory contextualization remained unaltered by cortisol irrespective of the timing of the drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows distinct time-dependent effects of cortisol on the contextualization of negative memories. These results suggest that non-genomic effects of cortisol may underlie impaired memory contextualization observed in PTSD, whereas genomic effects of cortisol may open avenues for cortisol as a protective agent against (traumatic) fear memory generalization.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cortisol</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>cognitive testing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub32"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19454</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19454</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Cortisol facilitates memory by enhancing hippocampal activation and functional connectivity</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Garfinkel</surname><given-names>Sarah N.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0003">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0003">2</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shaun Ho</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0004">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0004">4</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abelson</surname><given-names>James L.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Stephen F.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0005">5</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Edward E.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0006">6</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liberzon</surname><given-names>Israel</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_32_0001">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_32_0001"><label>1</label>Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA</aff><aff id="AF_32_0002"><label>2</label>Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK</aff><aff id="AF_32_0003"><label>3</label>Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK</aff><aff id="AF_32_0004"><label>4</label>Department of Psychiatry, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA</aff><aff id="AF_32_0005"><label>5</label>Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA</aff><aff id="AF_32_0006"><label>6</label>Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19454</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Stress and stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) modulate memory processes in both facilitative and deleterious ways, but mechanisms of memory enhancement are not yet fully understood.

In general, high levels of cortisol increase memory consolidation, especially for emotional material. For a long time, memories were thought to be stable and resistant to changes after their consolidation was completed. However, recent evidence suggests that consolidated memories are subject to modulation upon their recall (reactivation). This suggests that memory reactivation opens a window of opportunity allowing the memory trace to be modulated in a lasting manner. Given that cortisol is an important modulator of memory, we were interested in investigating how it could modulate reactivated memories.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the first study, 32 healthy men and women encoded a slideshow containing neutral and negative segments. Two days later, all participants recalled the slideshow (reactivation) and were randomly assigned to a stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) or a control condition. Memory was reassessed immediately after that, as well as 5 days later. For the second study, 33 healthy men were exposed to the slideshow (as described above). Three days later, they were either administered with a placebo or metyrapone (a cortisol synthesis inhibitor). All participants had to recall the slideshow when the medication was active, and 4 days later. The third study assessed the impact of real negative news from the media. Fifty-six healthy men and women who were media consumers were either exposed to real negative news or to real neutral ones. Subsequently, they were all exposed to the TSST and their memory for the news was assessed 24h later.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Study 1 demonstrated that emotional memory was enhanced following stress and this effect was still observed 5 days later. Study 2 results showed that memory reactivation of the emotional material was lower in the metyrapone group and this deficit was still present 4 days later. Study 3 demonstrated that women who were exposed to real negative news remembered this news more and were more stress reactive to a subsequent stressor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Memory is an active process that can be updated upon its reactivation and cortisol can act as a modulator of this process. Results of our studies will be discussed with regards to their relevance to the clinical domain, more particularly for posttraumatic stress disorder.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glucocorticoids</kwd><kwd>TSST</kwd><kwd>emotional memories</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub34"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19456</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19456</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Role of cortisol, sleep, and glucocorticoid receptors in memory consolidation and retrieval</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rimmele</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_34_0001">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_34_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Besedovsky</surname><given-names>Luciana</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_34_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wilhelm</surname><given-names>Ines</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_34_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Tanja</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_34_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Born</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_34_0002">2</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_34_0001"><label>1</label>Psychology Department, New York University, New York, NY, USA</aff><aff id="AF_34_0002"><label>2</label>Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany</aff><aff id="AF_34_0003"><label>3</label>Department of Neuroendocrinology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19456</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Memory functions involve three stages: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval.

At least in the rodent this apparent permanent outcome of early adversity can be modulated by maternal influences and depends on the later life environmental context with the stress hormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in the driver's seat. A frequently investigated model is the animal that has experienced as pup reduced maternal care. Such a period of early neglect enhances the pup's responsivity to adverse emotional experiences, an effect that can even be detected within families and was found to advance prematurely the development of emotional and fear circuitry. Alternatively, enhanced care is capable of overridingthe lasting impact of neurotoxicity in early life. For instance, the frequently reported adverse effect of early life treatment with dexamethasone (as life-saving treatment of prematurely born infants) is strikingly attenuated by enhanced maternal care induced by daily handling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Dr. Nederhof will review recent animal and human studies supporting the cumulative stress and mismatch hypotheses.

Far less researched, but of equal importance, is the theory that moderate early stress exposure instead of increasing vulnerability results in subsequent resilience. Variously described as inoculating, immunizing, steeling, or toughening, the notion that moderate postnatal stress exposure strengthens resistance to subsequent stressors has far-reaching implications for understanding the pathogenesis and prevention of stress-related affective disorders. Although the psychobiology of stress-inoculation-induced resilience in humans is largely unknown, new insights have emerged from seven studies of monkeys previously exposed to moderate postnatal stress compared to no-stress control-rearing conditions. Evidence from these studies indicates that early exposure to moderate stressors that temporarily stimulate anxiety and activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leads subsequently to diminished negative arousal, prosocial tendencies, enhanced cognitive control, increased curiosity, larger prefrontal cortical volumes, and attenuated HPA axis activation. In contrast to rodents, rearing differences in the development of neuroendocrine stress resistance in monkeys are more closely related to differences in prior stress exposure than to differences in maternal care. In addition, unlike in rodents, no rearing differences in glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity were observed in monkeys, suggesting that the neural basis of stress resistance in primates may differ from that in rodents. Finally, results from a pharmacological study, which further support the key role of acute early anxiety exposure in promoting the development of subsequent behavioral indications of resilience, will be presented. Findings from these non-human primate studies support the intriguing hypothesis that moderate early stress exposure may likewise provide a pathway to resilience in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stress inoculation</kwd><kwd>monkeys</kwd><kwd>childhood stress</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub38"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19459</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19459</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Natural variations in maternal care determine sensitivity to glucocorticoid regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and function in adult rats</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bagot</surname><given-names>Rosemary C.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19459</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>Variations in maternal care in the rat associate with robust differences in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning in the offspring. In addition, differences in stress reactivity associate with variations in maternal care. However, the potential influence of stress on hippocampal function is often overlooked in studies of effects of early life experience. Previously, we found differential modulation of hippocampal function and plasticity by stress in adult offspring exposed to varying levels of maternal care. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) regulate synaptic plasticity, and NMDAR function is modulated by stress and CORT. We hypothesised that altered NMDAR function underlies the interaction of maternal and stress effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used electrophysiology to examine NMDAR-dependent LTP and NMDAR synaptic function in adult offspring of mothers that varied in the frequency of pup licking/grooming (LG), i.e., High or Low LG.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Under basal conditions, long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of Low LG offspring relative to High LG offspring. Synaptic NMDAR function was enhanced in Low LG offspring with no change in &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor function (AMPAR). NMDAR antagonism by low concentration APV rescued the basal LTP deficit in Low LG offspring and inhibited LTP in High LG offspring. Stress-level CORT (100nM) rapidly enhanced LTP in offspring of Low LG rats and impaired LTP in offspring of High LG rats. CORT robustly increased NMDAR function in High LG offspring, eliminating the maternal effect. CORT did not affect NMDAR function in Low LG offspring. Thus, Low LG offspring exhibit basally elevated NMDAR function coupled with insensitivity to CORT modulation indicative of a chronic alteration of NMDAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that low maternal care exerts a lasting effect on hippocampal plasticity through enhanced function of NMDAR in synapses. The blunted effect of CORT on synaptic NMDAR in Low LG rats could be adaptive in promoting cognitive functioning in challenging conditions, such as the improved contextual fear conditioning previously observed in these rats.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>maternal care</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid regulation synaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub39"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19460</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19460</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>The effect of cumulative stress exposure on depressive symptoms is modified by a mineralocorticoid receptor haplotype</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vinkers</surname><given-names>Christian H.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0001">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Gastel</surname><given-names>Willemijn</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luykx</surname><given-names>Jurjen J.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schubart</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jo&#x000eb;ls</surname><given-names>Marian</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kahn</surname><given-names>Ren&#x000e9; S.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0001">1</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boks</surname><given-names>Marco P.M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_39_0001">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_39_0001"><label>1</label>Department of Psychiatry, Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands</aff><aff id="AF_39_0002"><label>2</label>Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences and Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands</aff><aff id="AF_39_0003"><label>3</label>Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19460</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Stress exposure increases the risk for the development of depression. The leading hypothesis is that stress exposure only increases the risk in individuals combining a vulnerable genetic background with (repeated) stress exposure. However, it is currently unknown which (combination) of stressful life events are the most etiologically relevant to predict depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests that repeated cumulative stress may have the highest impact.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We aimed to determine the effects of repeated stress exposure on depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) in a cross-sectional sample of healthy subjects (<italic>n</italic>=563). Repeated stress exposure was operationalized as exposure to three stressors: early life stress (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), later life stress (Life Stressor Checklist) and daily hassles. Because of the importance of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) for HPA axis responsivity, we investigated whether the MR haplotype (rs5522 and rs2070951) modified stress-induced depressive symptoms. For genetic analyses, we divided subjects into a low stress exposure group (0&#x02013;1 positive stress domains) and high stress exposure group (2&#x02013;3 positive three stress domains). Gender and cannabis use were included as covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Childhood trauma, later life stressors, and current daily hassles independently and cumulatively contributed to depressive symptoms (continuous and dichotomized).

Thus, our data implicate the existence of a multiple hit model in which independent but cumulative stress exposure leads to increased depressive symptoms.

Importantly, the MR haplotype moderated the cumulative effects of stress on depressive symptoms, confirming and extending earlier studies, which showed that the MR haplotype 2 is associated with reduced optimism and a blunted stress response.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HPA axis</kwd><kwd>mineralocorticoid</kwd><kwd>depressive</kwd><kwd>gene environment interaction</kwd><kwd>cumulative stress exposure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub40"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19449</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19449</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>A heartfelt response: oxytocin effects on response to social stress in men and women</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kubzansky</surname><given-names>Laura D.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Department of Society, Human Development, and Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19449</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Animal research has indicated that oxytocin is involved in social bonding, stress regulation, and positive physiologic adaptations that may be linked with greater longevity and successful aging. Because of its potential role in promoting positive human social behavior, recent research has focused on whether oxytocin may lead to improved social and emotional functioning for various mental disorders. Moreover, given its apparent anti-stress effects, some investigators have posited that oxytocin may provide the basis for the observed beneficial effects of positive social relationships on health. While knowledge of the effects of oxytocin in healthy humans remains limited, the emerging research has raised some doubt as to whether effects are uniformly prosocial or stress-reducing. Moreover, gender differences in these stress-related effects have been speculated but not tested in humans. In this study, we examine whether oxytocin enhances salutary responses to social stress and compare effects between men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Hypotheses were tested with a placebo-controlled, double-blind experiment, using a between subjects 2 (male vs. female)&#x000d7;2 (oxytocin vs. placebo) design.

Both stress response regulation and social factors influence response to trauma. While some social/interpersonal factors may mitigate response to trauma (e.g., social support), others can contribute to trauma-related symptoms (e.g., interpersonal avoidance). While most research on the effects of oxytocin shows a positive influence on social cognition/affiliation, other research suggests that this influence varies with context (e.g., oxytocin is associated with decreased trust/affiliation in the context of social threat). Furthermore, some studies of endogenous oxytocin levels show positive relationship between with symptoms of trauma related disorders (e.g., depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>We present data from a sample (<italic>n</italic>=90) of highly traumatized adults living in an urban environment.

One way of understanding this data is the idea that oxytocin is associated with salience of social cues. In some circumstances (e.g., relationships with trusted family members), oxytocin may positively influence social perceptions/behaviors. In other circumstance (e.g., threatening interpersonal contexts), it may be a marker for trauma-related symptoms such a depression and PTSD. Many of our study participants live in unsafe neighborhoods and have been exposed to repeated interpersonal trauma. Interpersonal trauma, particularly in childhood, may increase the likelihood social cues are perceived as threatening. Thus, these data point to the need for complex models in understanding relationship of trauma response and oxytocin and in efforts to use oxytocin in the treatment of trauma exposed individuals.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>social support</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>trauma</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub42"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19465</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19465</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Intranasal oxytocin improves recall of autobiographical memories: a dose-response study</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ellenbogen</surname><given-names>Mark A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Orlando</surname><given-names>Mark Anthony</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Christopher A.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Centre for Research in Human Development, Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19465</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>We previously found that the intranasal administration of oxytocin positively altered self-reported personality.

Inspection of the data, however, suggests that the social effects of OT often depend on contextual factors, including person characteristics. For example, some studies show that OT is helpful for avoidantly attached individuals, who are less socially engaged, whereas other studies show that OT exacerbates chronic interpersonal insecurities in anxiously attached individuals, who are preoccupied with closeness. Such variability raises questions about the mechanism by which OT influences human social behavior. Drawing upon animal research on OT and the other-directed (e.g., maternal) behavior, we propose that OT induces a similar shift in focus away from self and toward others in humans. This theory would explain some of the person-specific effects of OT since becoming more other- and less self-oriented should be helpful for avoidant individuals who are excessively focused on the self to the exclusion of others, but could be hurtful for anxious individuals who are already overly other focused and have no sense of self.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-one males received 24 IU intranasal OT/placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial and then completed tasks assessing the implicit cognitive accessibility and explicit self perceptions of agency (self orientation) and communion (other orientation). Individual differences in attachment were assessed at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>OT significantly decreased the cognitive accessibility of agency (self) and increased the cognitive accessibility of communion (other). Similarly, OT significantly decreased the endorsement of agency traits (arrogant) and increased the endorsement of communal traits (kind, warm, caring). Critically, this OT-induced shift from self to other differentially affected avoidant and anxiously attached participants, with avoidant individuals, who are generally low in communion, showing the largest increase in communion following OT, but anxious individuals, who are generally low in agency, showing even further reduction in agency/sense of self.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data shed light on the variability in extant research on the social effects of oxytocin in humans and help explain both the beneficial and potentially harmful effects of OT.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>attachment</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>avoidance</kwd><kwd>agency</kwd><kwd>communion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub45"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19448</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19448</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>The role of oxytocin at the interface of stress and social behavior</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yee</surname><given-names>Jason R.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Neural Medicine, Research Triangle Institute International, Boston, MA, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19448</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is well known for its positive effects on dampening stress responses and increasing prosocial behavior.

The biological basis for these far-reaching effects is not currently understood, but evidence suggests traumatic events could affect behavioral trajectories through changes in gene expression that are mediated by DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To explore this, we exposed male and female infant rats to nurturing or adverse caregiving environments.

In addition, females exposed to adverse caregiving environments later mistreated their own offspring, and their offspring likewise displayed altered DNA methylation. We are currently investigating the impact of nurturing vs. adverse caregiving environments on epigenetic gene regulation within a larger behaviorally relevant brain network (the medial prefrontal cortex, central/basolateral amygdala, dorsal vs. ventral hippocampus). Preliminary biochemistry data indicate caregiving experiences trigger epigenetic changes that differ between brain regions, sexes, and gene locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings demonstrate the remarkable ability of early-life caregiving environments to produce distinct epigenetic modifications across behaviorally relevant brain regions.

A few studies that have examined the course and outcome of later pregnancies in women with early trauma history bring up the intriguing possibility of transgenerational transmission of the effect of maternal childhood trauma on her developing fetus. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this effect have yet to be clarified. In humans and other higher primates, a stress-related system that is particularly relevant for key gestational processes, fetal development, and birth outcomes is placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (pCRH). In this study, we address the hypothesis that history of early life trauma is associated with variation in the level and trajectory of pCRH production over the course of human gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A study population of sociodemographically and ethnically diverse women with singleton pregnancies (<italic>N</italic>=333) provided information about childhood abuse and neglect (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, or CTQ). Placental CRH levels were assessed prospectively at 1&#x02013;5 time points over gestation (T1: mean=15.0 weeks, SD=.72 until T5: mean=36.5 weeks, SD=.78). Because of the expected exponential increase of pCRH production over gestation, pCRH values were log-transformed and Generalized Estimating Equation modeling was employed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred thirty-seven women (41.1%) reported having experienced at least one type of trauma during childhood, and 75 (22.5%) reported exposure to multiple traumas. A higher childhood trauma score was significantly associated with higher pCRH levels over the entire period of gestation (Wald <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>

In rodents, the level of maternal care causes lifelong differences in central glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity and memory. Furthermore, human adults with a history of child abuse have decreased hippocampal GC receptor gene expression and lower cortisol responses to stress. As GCs modulate memory, hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis functions altered by atypical care may influence memory.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were women (<italic>N</italic>=55) reporting no-to-minimal abuse (no maltreatment group) on the Child Trauma Questionnaire and those reporting clinically significant sexual or physical abuse (abuse group). Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as depression is more prevalent in child abuse survivors and is known to impact cortisol levels. Participants then completed the Emotional Picture Memory Task. During encoding, participants viewed pictures composed of negative or neutral emotionally valenced objects and backgrounds. In a surprise retrieval test, participants indicated if objects and backgrounds presented separately were the same, similar, or new to those viewed earlier. Saliva samples were collected to measure basal (unstressed) cortisol levels. Analyses focused on &#x0201c;gist&#x0201d; memory, and the percentage of responses when an object viewed previously was classified as similar or the same. Higher cortisol has been tied to better gist memory.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Abuse history moderated cortisol's effect on gist memory, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>=&#x02212;0.557, SE=0.212, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01. When controlling BDI, cortisol negatively correlated with memory in the abuse group and positively correlated with memory in the no abuse group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings are particularly compelling as the abuse group result contrasts with previous human memory and rodent research. However, basal vs. stress-induced cortisol may differentially affect memory. Furthermore, child abuse is likely a more profound early stressor compared to maternal neglect in rodents. In conclusion, early experience shapes how GCs affect cognitive functioning. This study is an essential step toward determining physiological and long-term effects of child abuse.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glucocorticoids</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>early life stress</kwd><kwd>salivary cortisol</kwd><kwd>HPA axis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub50"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19494</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19494</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Childhood adversity and inflammatory processes in youth: a prospective study</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Slopen</surname><given-names>Natalie</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0001">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0002">2</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0003">3</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kubzansky</surname><given-names>Laura D.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0002">2</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McLaughlin</surname><given-names>Katie A.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0001">1</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0004">4</xref><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0005">5</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Koenen</surname><given-names>Karestan C.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF_50_0006">6</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF_50_0001"><label>1</label>Center on the Developing Child, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA</aff><aff id="AF_50_0002"><label>2</label>, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA</aff><aff id="AF_50_0003"><label>3</label>, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA, USA</aff><aff id="AF_50_0004"><label>4</label>Division of General Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA</aff><aff id="AF_50_0005"><label>5</label>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA</aff><aff id="AF_50_0006"><label>6</label>Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19494</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><sec><title>Rationale/statement of the problem</title><p>Retrospective studies show that childhood adversity is associated with systemic inflammation in adulthood.

Department of Veterans Affairs administrative data were used to identify ICD-9 codes for mental health and autoimmune disorders and to obtain sociodemographic, military service, and health service utilization information.

In prior work, we reported that veterans who had recovered from combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had higher levels than those who were not combat exposed. NPY levels were significantly associated with the extent of symptom improvement, suggesting that plasma NPY levels may represent a biological correlate of resilience to, and/or recovery from, the adverse effects of trauma exposure. Cytosine methylation of the glucocorticoid gene (GR methylation) has been associated with PTSD risk and/or symptom expression. GR methylation is influenced by environmental factors that can result in enduring differences in function, including neuroendocrine regulation. As the NPY gene has glucocorticoid response elements, levels of circulating NPY represent a potential indicator of alterations in GR responsivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The relationship of NPY to PTSD and GR methylation was examined in two samples. In the first sample, veterans who developed PTSD following combat exposure were compared to those who did not develop PTSD. In a second sample, veterans with combat-related PTSD were assessed prior to and following a course of prolonged exposure (PE).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the cross-sectional study, veterans with PTSD had higher NPY levels than those who never developed PTSD (<italic>t</italic> (62)=&#x02212;1.99, <italic>p</italic>=0.05; 95.8&#x000b1;45.6 pm/l vs. 73.9&#x000b1;41.5 pm/l). NPY associated with number of GR methylated sites in the full sample (<italic>r</italic>=0.35, <italic>n</italic>=64, <italic>p</italic>=0.005), but not with average percent methylation (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.05). When the associations were examined separately by PTSD group status, results showed a positive association between NPY and number of methylated sites (<italic>r</italic>=0.36) as well as percent methylation (<italic>r</italic>=0.38) in veterans with PTSD. However, NPY was only associated with the number of methylated sites (r=0.35) in the subjects who did not develop PTSD following combat exposure. In the treatment study, plasma NPY levels increased among veterans who responded to treatment (who no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD following PE), compared to treatment non-responders, as indicated by a significant group &#x000e6; time interaction (F1,14=5.48, <italic>p</italic>=0.035). While plasma NPY was comparable in the two groups at pretreatment (responders: 71.4&#x000b1;20.3 pm/l, non-responders: 71.0&#x000b1;16.0 pm/l), responders had higher plasma NPY (84.0&#x000b1;24.2 pm/l) relative to non-responders (61.0&#x000b1;15.4 pm/l). Both pretreatment number of GR methylated sites (<italic>r</italic>=0.53, <italic>n</italic>=16, <italic>p</italic>=0.04) and average percent GR methylation (<italic>r</italic>=0.75, <italic>n</italic>=15, <italic>p</italic>=0.001) were associated with higher plasma NPY at post-treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To the extent that improvement from symptomatic PTSD may involve a mobilization of endogenous mechanisms to reduce hyperarousal and other post-trauma <italic>sequellae</italic>, the results of these studies are consistent in suggesting a role for NPY. NPY was elevated in a sample of combat veterans with PTSD, and increased in association with PTSD improvement in response to trauma-focused treatment. GR methylation was associated with combat-related PTSD in a cross-sectional study, and with treatment associated improvement in PTSD. These findings suggest that epigenetic modification of the GR gene may be associated with resilience in PTSD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide Y</kwd><kwd>PTSD, methlylation</kwd><kwd>prolonged exposure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub54"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19474</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19474</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of mifepristone in Gulf War veterans with chronic multisymptom illness</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Golier</surname><given-names>Julia A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Caramanica</surname><given-names>Kimberly</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schmeidler</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>Philip D.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yehuda</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>J.J.

The primary clinical outcome measure was the change from treatment baseline to treatment endpoint in the physical health component score (PCS) of the veterans SF-36 health survey. Primary neurocognitive outcome measures included change in spatial working memory and verbal declarative memory as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery. Additional outcome measures included change in the mental health components score (MCS) of the SF-36 and self-reported symptoms of fatigue, depression, and PTSD.

The identification of biomarkers for PTSD has been difficult, likely due to inter-individual differences in genetic risk factors and environmental exposures. The aim of the current study was to interrogate the influences of the environment on gene expression profiles by characterizing biological differences in PTSD after severe child abuse versus PTSD after adult trauma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 396 trauma-exposed individuals were included in this study. The PTSD symptomatic scale (PSS), clinician-administered PTSD scales (CAPS), childhood trauma questionnaire, and trauma events inventory were used to assess current clinical PTSD and childhood and adult trauma severity.

Patients with chronic pain have higher rates of PTSD. Likewise, patients with PTSD are often diagnosed with numerous chronic pain conditions. Despite the high pain-PTSD comorbidity, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood and only recently researchers have started to investigate pain-PTSD overlap using experimental pain models. The aim of the present study was to examine the activation of the pain-processing pathway in a cohort of combat PTSD compared to combat controls in response to a prolonged painful stimulus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Novel data from the experimental pain model using intramuscular capsaicin comparing a group of 10 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans with combat-related PTSD and 11 matched OEF/OIF veterans without PTSD will be presented. Intramuscular capsaicin causes a prolonged, deep-aching muscle pain, resembling pain associated with chronic pain states. Following capsaicin injection into the left thigh muscle, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning while whole brain perfusion was measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL). At every 10 min, samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were drawn and subjective pain ratings were measured throughout the scanning window (30 min). Following scanning, CSF draws and pain ratings continued and evidence for central sensitization was assessed by temporal summation of repeated pressure pain stimuli.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results show evidence for an acute form of central sensitization in the PTSD group in comparison to matched combat controls. The maximum pain response and initial pain decrease were not different between the two groups, yet significantly higher pain ratings were observed in the PTSD group 15 min postinjection of capsaicin. ASL showed significant group by time interactions within pain-processing network, whereby PTSD group maintained high levels of brain perfusion in the ventral medial frontal gyurs and other interoceptive and evaluative brain circuits throughout the second half of the scan, similar to subjective pain ratings. Furthermore, significantly higher temporal summation of pain was also noted in the PTSD compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found increased sensitivity to prolonged, deep experimental pain in combat-related PTSD compared to traumatized subjects who never developed PTSD following combat. We posit that this increased pain response on behavioral, spinal, and supraspinal levels is related to a form of acute central sensitization in these individuals in response to a prolonged pain stimulus. Initial neuroimaging findings point to differential activation of frontal systems as potentially underlying pain-PTSD pathways and perhaps provide initial mechanisms for the development of testable models of perturbed pain processing in PTSD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>capsaicin</kwd><kwd>sensitization</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub57"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Eur J Psychotraumatol</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">2000-8198</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2000-8066</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Co-Action Publishing</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">EJPT-3-19471</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19471</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Supplement 1, 2012</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>The longitudinal course of posttraumatic sensitization disorder</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McFarlane</surname><given-names>Alexander C.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Centre for Traumatic Stress Studies, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>10</day><month>9</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><pub-date pub-type="collection"><year>2012</year></pub-date><volume>3</volume><elocation-id content-type="doi">10.3402/ejpt.v3i0.19471</elocation-id><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2012 Symposium</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2012</copyright-year><license license-type="open-access" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"><license-p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License, permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</license-p></license></permissions><abstract><p>The gradual emergence of symptoms following exposure to traumatic events has presented a major conceptual challenge to psychiatry. The presumption that all people have significant acute symptoms is not supported by careful longitudinal research. One such study of 1,018 accident victims conducted over 2 years will be presented. The mechanism that leads to the progressive escalation of symptoms with the passage of time leading to delayed onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves the process of sensitisation and kindling. The acute stress response represents the neurobiological platform for the different trajectories of symptoms, and data on 49 participants will be presented, demonstrating how the acute hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis reactivity and melatonin levels predict later symptoms.</p><p>The development of traumatic memories at the time of stress exposure represents a major vulnerability through repeated environmental triggering of the increasing dysregulation of an individual's neurobiology. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates how the increased allostatic load associated with PTSD. This broader perspective has important implications for developing treatments that address the underlying dysregulation of cortical arousal and neurohormonal abnormalities, following exposure to traumatic stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>longitudinal course</kwd><kwd>vulnerability</kwd><kwd>allostatic

We hypothesized that altered functioning of the GR pathway is already present before development of PTSD and thus represents a biological vulnerability factor for the development of PTSD. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of several GR pathway components for the development of high levels of PTSD symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We included a cohort of 1,032 Dutch soldiers prior to deployment to Afghanistan. GR pathway components were assessed in blood collected prior to deployment. PTSD symptoms were assessed 6 months after return.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A high GR number, high GILZ mRNA expression, and low FKBP5 mRNA expression in leukocytes prior to deployment were independently associated with development of high levels of PTSD symptoms.

Amongst other things, this may be because of (i) limitations of previous methods for the assessment of long-term cortisol secretion as well as (ii) differences in the composition of the control group in which traumatized and non-traumatized individuals are often not distinguished. The current study aimed to address these problems by using assessments of glucocorticoids in hair as a measure of cumulative hormone secretion over prolonged periods of time and by carefully distinguishing between traumatized and non-traumatized controls. Data were obtained from 28 PTSD patients, 27 traumatized healthy controls, and 32 non-traumatized controls. Concentrations of cortisol (F) and cortisone (E) in proximal 3 cm hair segments were determined via LC-MS/MS. In addition, the severity of PTSD symptoms, the number of different lifetime-traumatic events, chronic stress, and depressiveness were measured. Results revealed that PTSD patients and traumatized healthy controls exhibited lower hair F and E levels compared to those of non-traumatized controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, for both). Furthermore, negative correlations between hair F levels and symptoms of intrusion (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.34, <italic>p</italic>=0.02) and the number of different traumatic events (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.36, <italic>p</italic>=0.01) were found in traumatized individuals. The current results suggest that trauma exposure may be a critical factor influencing long-term endocrine alterations, which can be observed even in otherwise healthy and non-psychopathological individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>posttraumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>traumatization</kwd><kwd>cortisol</kwd><kwd>cortisone</kwd><kwd>hair</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></sub-article></article>
