Often, these species are molten globules, which may be on- or off-pathway to the native state. Molten globules are ensembles of interconverting protein conformers that have a substantial amount of secondary structure, but lack virtually all tertiary side-chain packing characteristics of natively folded proteins. Due to solvent-exposed hydrophobic groups, molten globules are prone to aggregation, which can have detrimental effects on organisms. The molten globule observed during folding of the 179-residue apoflavodoxin from <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> is off-pathway, as it has to unfold before native protein can form. Here, we study folding of apoflavodoxin and characterize its molten globule using fluorescence spectroscopy and F&#x000f6;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Apoflavodoxin is site-specifically labeled with fluorescent donor and acceptor dyes, utilizing dye-inaccessibility of Cys69 in cofactor-bound protein. Donor (i.e., Alexa Fluor 488) is covalently attached to Cys69 in all apoflavodoxin variants used. Acceptor (i.e., Alexa Fluor 568) is coupled to Cys1, Cys131 and Cys178, respectively. Our FRET data show that apoflavodoxin&#x02019;s molten globule forms in a non-cooperative manner and that its N-terminal 69 residues fold last. In addition, striking conformational differences between molten globule and native protein are revealed, because the inter-label distances sampled in the 111-residue C-terminal segment of the molten globule are shorter than observed for native apoflavodoxin. Thus, FRET sheds light on the off-pathway nature of the molten globule during folding of an &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; parallel protein.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) supported this work (grant number 700.56.002).

To describe protein folding, the concept of a multidimensional energy landscape or folding funnel arose from a combination of experimental data, theory and simulation <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bryngelson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Dill1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Dinner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Vendruscolo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Fersht1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In this model, proteins descend along a funnel wall describing the free energy of folding, until they reach the native state. Folding energy landscapes usually are rugged and comprise kinetic traps and barriers that pose restrictions on the way to the native state. As a result, partially folded intermediates are formed, which may be on- or off-pathway to the native state. When the intermediate is on-pathway, as is observed for the majority of proteins studied to date, it has native-like topology and is productive for folding. In contrast, when the intermediate is off-pathway, it is trapped in such a manner that the native state cannot be reached without substantial reorganizational events <xref rid="pone.0045746-Jahn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The resemblance between early kinetic intermediates and molten globules <xref rid="pone.0045746-Ohgushi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Ptitsyn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Arai1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> suggests that these molten globules can be considered as models of transient intermediates <xref rid="pone.0045746-Jahn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several kinetic studies have revealed involvement of off-pathway intermediates during protein folding (see e.g. <xref rid="pone.0045746-FernandezRecio1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Melo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). The formation of a kinetically trapped off-pathway molten globule increases the likelihood of protein aggregation. Elucidation of the formation and conformation of molten globules offers potential insights into factors responsible for protein misfolding, aggregation, and, potentially, for numerous devastating pathologies <xref rid="pone.0045746-Chiti1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Dobson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Structural characterization of molten globules is hampered by the often transient nature of their existence, their usually relatively low population at equilibrium, and their aggregation at high protein concentrations <xref rid="pone.0045746-Jaenicke1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. One needs techniques that detect these species with high sensitivity, and thus fluorescence spectroscopy and the phenomenon of F&#x000f6;rster Resonance Energy Transfer are very suitable <xref rid="pone.0045746-Stryer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Amir1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. FRET is the distance dependent transfer of electronic excitation energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative dipole-dipole coupling. This phenomenon enables detection of distances between donor and acceptor molecules of typically &#x0003c;10 nm <xref rid="pone.0045746-Stryer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Frster1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Lakowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The FRET efficiency (<italic>E</italic>) strongly depends on the distance (<italic>r</italic>) between a donor and an acceptor molecule, according to:<disp-formula id="pone.0045746.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0045746.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>with <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> being the F&#x000f6;rster distance, i.e., the distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%. Labeling of proteins with bright donor and acceptor dyes strongly facilitates the use of FRET to study protein folding. Here, we employ FRET to study the folding of dye-labeled <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> apoflavodoxin, and to characterize its off-pathway molten globule.</p><p>Flavodoxins are monomeric flavoproteins that are involved in electron transfer and contain a non-covalently bound FMN cofactor <xref rid="pone.0045746-Mayhew1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These proteins adopt the flavodoxin-like topology, also referred to as the doubly-wound or &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; parallel topology. This topology is among the most common topologies in the protein databank, and is shared by many functionally and sequentially unrelated proteins.</p><p>We demonstrated previously that folding of apoflavodoxin occurs spontaneously. Time-dependent folding of apoflavodoxin involves an energy landscape with two intermediates, and is described by the following kinetic model: I<sub>off</sub> &#x021d4; unfolded apoflavodoxin &#x021d4; I<sub>on</sub> &#x021d4; native apoflavodoxin <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Non-covalent binding of FMN to native apoflavodoxin is the last step in flavodoxin folding <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Native apoflavodoxin (i.e., flavodoxin without FMN) strongly resembles flavodoxin, except for dynamic disorder in the flavin-binding region <xref rid="pone.0045746-Steensma1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Steensma2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Intermediate I<sub>on</sub> lies on the productive folding route from unfolded to native protein and is highly unstable. Approximately 90% of folding molecules fold via off-pathway intermediate I<sub>off</sub>, which is a relatively stable species that needs to unfold to produce native protein and thus acts as a trap. Formation of an off-pathway folding species is probably inherent to the folding of proteins with a flavodoxin-like fold <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, as this species is experimentally observed for other &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; parallel proteins of which the kinetic folding has been investigated (i.e., apoflavodoxin from <italic>Anabaena</italic>

The midpoint of denaturation as detected by far-UV CD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> is 1.72&#x000b1;0.05 M GuHCl. Thus, the folding curves obtained by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy do not coincide. This non-coincidence is a characteristic for population of a folding intermediate state. Furthermore, fluorescence anisotropy data of apoflavodoxin depend biphasically on denaturant concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>), which is another characteristic for population of a folding intermediate state. Hence, description of apoflavodoxin equilibrium folding data requires use of a model that takes native, intermediate and unfolded states into account. Because intermediate I<sub>on</sub> is highly unstable, this intermediate is not detected at equilibrium. Consequently, denaturant-dependent equilibrium folding of apoflavodoxin is described by the three-state equilibrium model I<sub>off</sub> &#x021d4; unfolded apoflavodoxin &#x021d4; native apoflavodoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Off-pathway intermediate I<sub>off</sub> populates significantly at equilibrium, enabling characterization of its properties. For example, at about 2 M GuHCl virtually no native apoflavodoxin molecules are present as judged from fluorescence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>), but still a significant CD signal is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, the folding intermediate has a substantial amount of secondary structure, but lacks the tertiary side-chain packing of natively folded apoflavodoxin. This observation is typical for a molten globule-like intermediate. Apoflavodoxin&#x02019;s molten globule species is compact, its three tryptophans are solvent-exposed, and it has severely broadened NMR resonances due to exchange between different conformers on the micro- to millisecond time scale <xref rid="pone.0045746-Bollen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-vanMierlo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-vanMierlo2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Engel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

To obtain these proteins, we introduce cysteine residues at appropriate positions into apoflavodoxin.

To fulfill this criterion, we utilize specific properties of the cofactor-bound form of the protein. Donor (i.e., Alexa Fluor 488 C<sub>5</sub> maleimide; A488) is coupled to Cys69, whereas acceptor (i.e., Alexa Fluor 568 C<sub>5</sub> maleimide; A568) is attached to Cys1, Cys131, or Cys178, respectively.

All protein variants expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> contain tightly bound FMN. Tight binding of FMN occurs primarily through a very specific combination and geometry of hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions with native apoflavodoxin. Consequently, the observation that all apoflavodoxin variants of this study bind FMN tightly implies that the three-dimensional structures of the corresponding flavodoxins are nearly indistinguishable from the one of wild-type flavodoxin.

In case of unfolded d69-a131 and d69-a178, FRET plays a role, because their tryptophan fluorescence is lower than that of &#x02018;donor-only&#x02019; apoflavodoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>).

Upon attaching acceptor label to native &#x02018;donor-only&#x02019; apoflavodoxin, fluorescence intensity of donor A488 severely decreases, as comparison of native baselines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3b</xref> shows. This decrease is due to FRET from A488 to A568. Whereas at zero molar denaturant this FRET between both dyes is similarly efficient for d69-a1 and d69-a131, it is less efficient in case of d69-a178. Upon unfolding of doubly dye-labeled protein above 2 M GuHCl, donor fluorescence increases and levels off at high concentrations of denaturant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). Fluorescence emission intensity of A488 of fully unfolded protein at 6.9 M GuHCl decreases from d69-a178, d69-a1 to d69-a131. This order is consistent with the number of amino acid residues in between donor and acceptor in these proteins, which decreases from 108, to 67, and to 61 residues, respectively.</p><p>Besides diminishing of tryptophan fluorescence due to transfer of excitation energy to Alexa dyes, we observe folding-dependent quenching of fluorescence of directly excited acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>).

Recently, tryptophan has been identified as the most potent photon induced electron transfer quencher of Alexa fluorophores. When such a fluorophore is in proximity of tryptophan, photon induced electron transfer towards tryptophan can occur and as a result fluorescence of the dye involved diminishes due to static quenching <xref rid="pone.0045746-Mansoor1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Due to this quenching, A568 fluorescence of unfolded apoflavodoxin decreases from d69-a1, to d69-a178, and to d69-a131, respectively. This order reflects the number of amino acid residues in between acceptor and nearest tryptophan in the primary sequence of the protein (i.e., 72, 10, and 2 residues, respectively). In case of native protein, Trp74 and Trp167 are in the protein interior, whereas Trp128 is located at the protein surface <xref rid="pone.0045746-Visser1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Concomitantly, fluorescence emission intensity of A568 drops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>), revealing exposure of hydrophobic side chains of tryptophans and tyrosines in folding intermediate, which both act as fluorescence quenchers of acceptor label (with tryptophan being the dominant quencher). Exposure of hydrophobic side chains probably causes a slight decrease in reorientation rate of A568, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g005">Fig. 5</xref> suggests. The C-terminal part of the molten globule, involving residues 69 to 178, must thus be rather compact and differs considerably from native protein. This part of the molten globule has a midpoint of unfolding of &#x0223c;2 M GuHCl.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Folding of Apoflavodoxin&#x02019;s Molten Globule is Non-cooperative</title><p>In case of d69-a1, where <italic>E<sub>app</sub></italic> monitors folding of the N-terminal 69 residues of the protein, no hump exists in the corresponding denaturant-dependent folding curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>). Despite the absence of this hump, apoflavodoxin&#x02019;s folding intermediate does populate in between &#x0223c;0.8 to &#x0223c;3.0 M GuHCl, as the non-coincidence of the unfolding transitions of d69-a1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Figures 3a-c</xref> demonstrates. Hence, the observed decrease of <italic>E<sub>app</sub></italic> in this denaturant range implies that the N-terminal 69 residues of the folding intermediate unfold above 0.8 M GuHCl. This unfolding is supported by fluorescence emission intensity of A568, which also shows no hump during denaturant-dependent equilibrium folding of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>). In native d69-a1, due to its vicinity and partial solvent accessibility, Tyr47 quenches fluorescence of A568. At about 1 M GuHCl, where folding intermediate is also present, this quenching sustains, implying that the N-terminal part of this intermediate must be structured at relatively low concentrations of GuHCl. Increasing denaturant concentration leads to increased fluorescence of A568, because the N-terminal part of the molten globule unfolds and because unfolded d69-a1 becomes populated. Unfolding of the N-terminal part of the molten globule thus occurs at lower denaturant concentration than happens for its C-terminal part. This observation shows that folding of apoflavodoxin&#x02019;s molten globule is non-cooperative.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Unfolding of Transiently Ordered Regions in Unfolded Apoflavodoxin</title><p>The data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Figure 3</xref> imply that the unfolded state of apoflavodoxin, which is fully populated at about 3 M GuHCl, expands upon increasing denaturant concentration. Upon adding denaturant, <italic>E<sub>app</sub></italic> diminishes for all three dye-labeled unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>), because the average separation between donor and acceptor dyes increases.

This expansion of unfolded protein with increasing denaturant reflects unfolding of transiently ordered regions that exist in unfolded apoflavodoxin at about 3 M GuHCl. At 6 M GuHCl, the protein behaves as random coil <xref rid="pone.0045746-Nabuurs1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045746-Nabuurs2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>FRET Data Show that the Conformations of Molten Globule and Native Apoflavodoxin Differ Drastically</title><p>NMR spectroscopy shows that upon lowering denaturant concentration, structure formation within virtually all parts of unfolded apoflavodoxin precedes folding to the molten globule state.

NMR spectroscopy detects formation of apoflavodoxin&#x02019;s molten globule in an indirect manner through disappearance of resonances of unfolded protein.

In contrast, in the study presented here we directly detect features of this molten globule by measuring fluorescence emission and FRET of the dye labels that are covalently attached to the protein. These fluorescence data show that upon decreasing denaturant concentration, the C-terminal 111 residues of the molten globule fold first, leading to a conformation that differs drastically from the one of the C-terminal part of native protein. The N-terminal part of this species is still unfolded and upon lowering denaturant concentration this protein part becomes structured, as the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045746-g003">Figure 3</xref> imply. This study shows that the conformations of molten globule and native protein differ considerably. Hence, to produce native &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; parallel protein, the molten globule needs to unfold, explaining why this folding species is off-pathway during folding of apoflavodoxin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein Engineering, Expression and Purification of Flavodoxin Variants Containing Cysteine Pairs</title><p>Single oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis <xref rid="pone.0045746-Shenoy1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> was used to generate three variants of <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> (strain ATCC 478) flavodoxin II, which each contain a pair of cysteine residues.
