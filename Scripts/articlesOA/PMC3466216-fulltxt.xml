Cas4 is thought to play a role in the capture of new viral DNA sequences for incorporation into the host genome. No biochemical activity has been reported for Cas4, but it is predicted to include a RecB nuclease domain. We show here that Cas4 family proteins from the archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> utilise four conserved cysteine residues to bind an iron-sulfur cluster in an arrangement reminiscent of the AddB nuclease of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The Cas4 family protein Sso0001 is a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; single stranded DNA exonuclease <italic>in vitro</italic> that is stalled by extrahelical DNA adducts. A role for Cas4 in DNA duplex strand resectioning to generate recombinogenic 3&#x02032; single stranded DNA overhangs is proposed. Comparison of the AddB structure with that of a related bacterial nuclease from <italic>Eubacterium rectales</italic> reveals that the iron-sulfur cluster can be replaced by a zinc ion without disrupting the protein structure, with implications for the evolution of iron-sulfur binding proteins.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant number G011400).

Immunity is acquired by the capture of short viral DNA sequences known as &#x0201c;protospacers&#x0201d;, which are incorporated into the host genome, flanked by CRISPR repeat sequences and subsequently termed &#x0201c;spacers&#x0201d;. The CRISPR array is transcribed and processed to generate short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are utilised by CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to detect and subsequently degrade invading viruses with cognate sequences. In archaea, both viral DNA <xref rid="pone.0047232-Lintner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047232-Gudbergsdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and RNA <xref rid="pone.0047232-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047232-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> can be targetted for cleavage. The spacer acquisition process is not understood at a mechanistic level, but requires the ubiquitous Cas1 and Cas2 proteins, which have DNA and RNA endonuclease activities, respectively <xref rid="pone.0047232-Wiedenheft2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047232-Beloglazova1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Frequently, the <italic>cas</italic>1 and <italic>cas</italic>2 genes are found in close proximity to the gene encoding the Cas4 protein, one of the original core Cas proteins defined by Jansen and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0047232-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Cas4 bears a clear relationship with the archaeal-specific Cas protein Csa1 <xref rid="pone.0047232-Haft1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and the two genes are frequently found adjacent to one another. Both have a RecB nuclease domain and three absolutely conserved cysteine residues near the C-terminus <xref rid="pone.0047232-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047232-Haft1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It has been suggested that Csa1 be renamed Cas4&#x02032; in light of their close relationship <xref rid="pone.0047232-Bernick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the archaeon <italic>Thermoproteus tenax</italic>, Cas4 and Csa1 have been shown to associate physically with Cas1 and Cas2 <xref rid="pone.0047232-Plagens1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, suggesting that these four proteins may work together in the spacer acquisition pathway. In some genomes, such as <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>, the <italic>cas</italic>1 and <italic>cas</italic>4 genes are fused, further emphasizing their likely functional interaction <xref rid="pone.0047232-Viswanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Alignment of a subset of archaeal Cas4-family proteins from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, <italic>Sulfolobus tokadaii</italic>, <italic>T. tenax</italic> and <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>, followed by construction of a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree, demonstrates that the Csa1 and Cas4 proteins form sub-groups within the Cas4 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

This arrangement is strongly reminiscent of the AddB family of exonucleases implicated in DNA recombination in bacteria <xref rid="pone.0047232-Yeeles1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. AddB utilises the four cysteine residues to form a conserved iron-sulfur cluster binding domain sometimes known as a &#x0201c;staple&#x0201d; that is essential for the structural integrity of the protein. A related protein, gp19 encoded by the archaeal virus SIRV2, shares the nuclease and four cysteine motifs and has recently been reported to possess Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent nuclease activity <xref rid="pone.0047232-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

The proteins were expressed by inducing with IPTG and purified using Ni-affinity and gel filtration chromatography, yielding essentially pure protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Both the Sso0001 and Sso1391 proteins had a olive-green colour characteristic of iron-sulfur proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The Sso0001 protein was stable when stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C but lost colour and activity over several days when stored at 4&#x000b0;C, presumably due to degradation and loss of the FeS cluster. Sso1391 was markedly less stable than Sso0001, possibly due to the absence of Cas protein partners with which it may form a complex <xref rid="pone.0047232-Plagens2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For Sso0001, the ratio of iron atoms in each protein molecule was estimated using an iron-chelation assay. Duplicate experiments yielded a mean ratio of 4.3 iron atoms per protein, consistent with the presence of a 4Fe:4S cluster. Individual substitution of each of the four cysteine residues of Sso0001 to alanine resulted in the expression of insoluble protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>, consistent with a role as Fe: S ligands, suggesting that the FeS cluster is crucial for the stability of the protein (data not shown).</p><p>Sso0001 was passed through a Superose 12 column calibrated with proteins of known size to allow an estimation of its quaternary structure. The retention time observed was consistent with a molecular weight of 175 kDa whereas a single subunit of Sso0001 has a molecular weight of 23 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, Sso0001 is clearly not monomeric, although gel filtration does not allow molecular weights to be measured accurately. Many 5&#x02032; exonucleases assemble into toroidal structures that thread DNA through the central pore, including trimeric enzymes such as lambda exonuclease <xref rid="pone.0047232-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047232-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and the tetrameric RecE exonuclease <xref rid="pone.0047232-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, both of which are related to the Cas4 nuclease family.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Sso0001 is a metal dependent nuclease</title><p>The nuclease activities of Sso0001 and Sso1391 were tested using fluorescent DNA or RNA oligonucleotides.

<xref rid="pone.0047232-Plagens1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Cleavage of a 15T DNA oligonucleotide by Sso0001 was observed in the presence of either magnesium or manganese, yielding a cluster of products of around 1&#x02013;5 nt in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). A 20U RNA oligonucleotide was cleaved in the presence of manganese but not magnesium. RNA degradation was observed consistently to be slower than DNA degradation, suggesting that single-stranded DNA is the relevant target <italic>in vivo</italic>. To ensure that the nuclease activity was derived from the Sso0001 protein, a variant carrying the mutation D99A was constructed. This eliminates one of the essential metal binding ligands of the nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); the equivalent mutation in the AddB nuclease abrogates nuclease activity <xref rid="pone.0047232-Yeeles2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The Sso0001 D99A variant failed to cut DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that the activity observed is due to the canonical RecB domain of the protein. To determine whether Sso0001 was an exo- or endo-nuclease, the enzyme was incubated with circular ssDNA from phiX174 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). No degradation of the DNA was observed over the time-course of the experiment, suggesting that Sso0001 is an exonuclease.</p><p>To characterize the exonuclease activity of Sso0001 in more detail, a DNA oligonucleotide substrate labelled at the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; terminus with a 6FAM fluorescein moiety was utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). When labelled at the 5&#x02032; end, the only product observed had a size around 4 nt. In contrast, with the 3&#x02032;-end labelled substrate, the progressive generation of smaller products differing in size by 1 nucleotide over the course of the reaction time was observed, finally resulting in fragments of 1&#x02013;2 nt in size. This result demonstrates that Sso0001 acts as a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; nuclease and appears to initiate cleavage at the 5&#x02032; end of the substrate. The reaction kinetics for the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;- labelled substrates were similar, suggesting that the 6FAM moiety at the 5&#x02032; end of the DNA, which has a six-carbon spacer, did not inhibit the enzyme significantly, although some effect on reaction rates cannot be ruled out. To determine whether Sso0001 was processive or distributive in its mode of action, the exonuclease reaction was initiated with a 50 nt 3&#x02032;-FAM labelled substrate oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). After 1 min, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled substrate oligonucleotide was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min. Comparison of the reaction products with matched control time points where no unlabeled substrate was added showed that substrates were not degraded to completion when excess unlabeled substrate was available. This suggests that Sso0001 is at least partly distributive rather than purely processive in its mode of action.</p><p>The activity of Sso0001 was further characterized by comparing the digestion of a 31 nt oligonucleotide containing an internal extra-helical fluorescein at position 19, in the context of both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The duplex DNA was clearly much more resistant to degradation, confirming the specificity of Sso0001 for ssDNA. The preference for ssDNA substrates is in marked contrast to the toroidal exonucleases such as lambda and RecE, which process dsDNA substrates <xref rid="pone.0047232-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A pronounced pause site was observed in the degradation of the internally labelled DNA, corresponding to the position of the extra-helical fluorescein 11 nt from the 3&#x02032; end. This confirms that the Cas4 family proteins are 5&#x02032;-end directed nucleases and have difficulty bypassing bulky DNA adducts, probably because the ssDNA must be threaded through the active site of the enzyme to allow progressive cleavage in a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction. Minor amounts of products of 1-4 nt size could be observed to accumulate over time, suggesting that the barrier presented by the extrahelical fluorescein was not absolute.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Relationship of Cas4 with other nucleases</title><p>We have shown that the Cas4 protein belongs to a family of &#x0201c;iron staple&#x0201d; proteins. The best characterised is the AddB nuclease, a 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exonuclease that functions along with the AddA helicase to generate recombination intermediates with 3&#x02032; ssDNA tails in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047232-Yeeles1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

The structure of AddAB has been reported recently <xref rid="pone.0047232-Saikrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, revealing a helicase-nuclease machine with the C-terminal AddB nuclease domain positioned to cleave ssDNA generated by the helicase.

<xref rid="pone.0047232-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A structural model for Sso0001 is shown alongside the AddB nuclease structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Both structures have four cysteine residues clustered in a suitable configuration to bind a 4Fe:4S cluster. Conserved catalytic residues in the RecB nuclease domain are positioned in very similar locations and are likely to be involved in binding the catalytic metal ion(s) at the active site or have other roles in substrate binding or catalysis. Conserved residues are found at most equivalent positions in other Cas4 family members in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> and in the SIRV2 viral nuclease protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the AddB/Cas4 nuclease family has intriguing similarities to a family of putative nucleases found in bacteria and bacteriophages, typified by the protein EUBREC_2131 of <italic>Eubacterium rectale,</italic> a member of the DUF3799 protein family. Recently, a crystal structure of this protein (PDB code 3L0A) has been deposited in the protein data bank by a structural genomics consortium. Although as yet undescribed, the structure clearly shows the same arrangement of four cysteine residues forming a metal ligand, coupled with a RecB nuclease structure that is closely related to the RecE exonuclease of <italic>E. coli</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047232-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, in this protein structure the FeS cluster has been replaced with a zinc ion. The role of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins such as AddB, as well as helicases and polymerases, is a matter of some debate (see <xref rid="pone.0047232-White1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> for a recent review). One school of thought is that these clusters function as redox sensors and may even be used actively to detect DNA damage <xref rid="pone.0047232-Mui1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Another hypothesis is that FeS clusters in many proteins are purely structural features, perhaps evolutionary relics of an anaerobic past when FeS clusters were much more common in proteins <xref rid="pone.0047232-White2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. One prediction of the latter scenario is that FeS clusters may have been replaced gradually with cysteine-coordinated zinc ions in the course of evolution. The structural comparison of the AddB/Cas4 nuclease with the <italic>E. rectale</italic> nuclease may be a case in point, although one cannot rule out the possibility that the zinc ion in the <italic>E. rectale</italic> nuclease is artifactual until biochemical data are available to support its functional significance. Recent studies have shown that in eukaryotic DNA polymerases a four cysteine motif shown to bind zinc on overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic> does in fact bind a 4Fe-4S cluster <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047232-Netz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Likewise, other known FeS proteins, including Nar1 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and IscU from <italic>Haemophilius influenza</italic>, have been found to contain zinc upon overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic>

Since there is already evidence that Cas4 forms functional complexes with Cas1 and Cas2, it is likely that the nuclease activity of Cas4 is modulated and controlled by its partner proteins, ensuring that its potential for DNA degradation is kept under tight control. One possible role for Cas4 in the CRISPR acquisition pathway is to generate recombinogenic 3&#x02032;-ssDNA overhangs in duplex DNA protospacers selected for incorporation into the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047232-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Since Cas4-family exonucleases are active against ssDNA, end resectioning would require the activity of a helicase to unwind duplex DNA substrates.
