We report here that a new bacterial strain isolated from soil, designated DG-02, was shown to degrade 95.6% of 50 mg&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 3-PBA within 72 h in mineral salt medium (MSM). Strain DG-02 was identified as <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. based on the morphology, physio-biochemical tests and 16S rRNA sequence. The optimum conditions for 3-PBA degradation were determined to be 30.9&#x000b0;C and pH 7.7 using response surface methodology (RSM). The isolate converted 3-PBA to produce 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy) benzoic acid, protocatechuate, phenol, and 3,4-dihydroxy phenol, and subsequently transformed these compounds with a <italic>q</italic>

A novel microbial metabolic pathway for 3-PBA was proposed on the basis of these metabolites. Inoculation of strain DG-02 resulted in a higher degradation rate on 3-PBA than that observed in the non-inoculated soil. Moreover, the degradation process followed the first-order kinetics, and the half-life (<italic>t</italic>

This study highlights an important potential application of strain DG-02 for the in situ bioremediation of 3-PBA contaminated environments.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors would like to thank the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation (No.30871660), P.

In addition, it is also the important chemical raw material widely used in the manufacture of SPs and dyes <xref rid="pone.0050456-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A consequence of the increased availability, usage and broad-spectrum applicability of 3-PBA is its widespread exposure among the general population. Recent evidences suggest that 3-PBA is the most frequently detected xenobiotic in human urine <xref rid="pone.0050456-Ueyama1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050456-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Moreover, it also possesses endocrine disrupting activity <xref rid="pone.0050456-Tyler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050456-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and adversely affects reproductive function and sexual development as well as the immune system in men <xref rid="pone.0050456-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050456-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As the general metabolic product of SPs, 3-PBA is considered far more potent as endocrine disruptor than the parent molecules <xref rid="pone.0050456-Tyler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In the natural environment, 3-PBA is persistent and refractory to degradation. The half-life in soil is reported ranging from 120 to 180 days depending on soil type, climate and other conditions <xref rid="pone.0050456-Halden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Moreover, 3-PBA can enter into the aqueous phase, but it tends to be absorbed to the sediment, which in turn increases its half-life in soil <xref rid="pone.0050456-Tyler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The accumulation and widespread use of 3-PBA have resulted in its ubiquitous presence as a contaminant in urban sediments and surface water thus should be of great environmental and public health concern <xref rid="pone.0050456-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Topp1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Effective measures for disposal of this toxic chemical are critically needed to ensure that human and environmental health will not be compromised by the continued use of 3-PBA. Bioremediation involving the use of living microorganisms in the removal of pollutants is the most promising, environmentally friendly, relatively efficient, and cost-effective process <xref rid="pone.0050456-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. There is growing body of evidence that environmental hazardous materials could be successfully eliminated by diverse microorganisms belonging to different taxonomic groups <xref rid="pone.0050456-Cyco1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, limited reports have far been available in the literature regarding the microbial degradation of 3-PBA by a pure bacterial culture. A possible reason is attributed to its toxicity. Previous studies demonstrated that 3-PBA was refractory to microbial degradation and enhanced degradation could not occur in the pure culture <xref rid="pone.0050456-Halden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Although several bacterial strains have been reported to degrade low concentrations of 3-PBA <xref rid="pone.0050456-Halden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen4" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, yet no report on mineralization of this compound is available. Halden et al. <xref rid="pone.0050456-Halden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> reported firstly that <italic>Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes</italic> strain POB310 was able to utilize 3-PBA as a growth substrate in soil. But degradation of 3-PBA in soil by strain POB310 was incomplete, and bacterial densities decreased even under the most favorable conditions (100 mg&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 3-PBA, supplementation with P and N, and soil water-holding capacity of 90%). <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> sp. strain ZS-S-01 seems to be the most efficient strain, since it degraded 250 mg&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 3-PBA within 14 days with a degradation rate of 82.9% <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the microbial metabolic pathway of 3-PBA has not been investigated so far and remains unclear.</p><p>The objective of this study was to screen isolates that were capable of effectively degrading 3-PBA. Moreover, the metabolic pathway was first proposed and the potential for bioremediation of 3-PBA contaminated soils was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemicals and Media</title><p>Standards of 3-PBA (98% purity) and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (98% purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. 3-Phenoxybenzyl alcohol standard (99% purity) was purchased from Dr.Ehrenstorfer GmbH, Germany.

Another possible reason for degradation reduction could be attributed to the fact that 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol is more toxic and refractory to microbial degradation than 3-PBA <xref rid="pone.0050456-Tyler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Meeker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Laffin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

A similar observation has been reported in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain ET1 <xref rid="pone.0050456-Topp1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>It was noteworthy that <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. strain DG-02 degraded and utilized 3-PBA as a growth substrate in MSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050456-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, supplementation of 1% glucose in MSM greatly enhanced the transformation of 3-PBA, thus reflecting excellent environmental adaptation. This is an important feature of a pesticide-degrading microorganism to be employed for bioremediation of variable environments. However, this observation did not quite agree with Cyco&#x00144; et al. <xref rid="pone.0050456-Cyco2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> who found supplementation with additional carbon sources led to a lag period followed by enhanced degradation, since these strains preferred to utilize readily available carbon sources.</p><p>In the current study, the particular strain was found to efficiently degrade 3-PBA over a broad range of temperature (20&#x02013;40&#x000b0;C) and pH (5.5&#x02013;9.5), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050456-t001">Table 1</xref>. This phenomenon gives pesticide-degrading microorganisms advantage in the environment, because they survival and utilize xenobiotics even exposed to adverse condition <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen8" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In addition, the optimum conditions for 3-PBA degradation by strain DG-02 were determined to be 30.9&#x000b0;C and pH 7.7 based on the response surface methodology (RSM). Under these conditions, strain DG-02 successfully remove the 50 mg&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 3-PBA initially added to the medium within 72 h. It is interesting to note that the degradation was higher at the alkaline conditions. This might be because the higher pH increases the rate of 3-PBA transformation, whereas the acidic conditions may increase the 3-PBA stability and its resistance to chemical and microbial degradation, as described previously by Cyco&#x00144; et al. <xref rid="pone.0050456-Cyco2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> for thiophanate-methyl.</p><p>Another important feature which is worth mentioning is that this strain engaged in efficient degradation of 3-PBA up to the concentration, as high as 500 mg&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In contrast to other reports on toxic effects of 3-PBA on different bacteria <xref rid="pone.0050456-Halden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, our results suggested that 3-PBA metabolism activity of <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. strain DG-02 was not subject to complete catabolite repression by high 3-PBA concentration. However, the specific 3-PBA degradation rate slightly decreased with an increase in the initial 3-PBA concentration, and the critical inhibitor concentration (<italic>S</italic>
<sub>m</sub>) was determined to be 65.0858 mg&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050456-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of the results of metabolite identification, the metabolic pathway of 3-PBA was first proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050456-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The transient accumulation of 3-(2-hydroxyphenoxy) benzoic acid indicated that the degradation of 3-PBA by <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. strain DG-02 was initiated by oxidization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050456-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, step I). Moreover, small amounts of the metabolites protocatechuate, phenol, and 3,4-dimethoxy phenol followed by cleavage of the diaryl ether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050456-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, step II), were detected during the degradation of 3-PBA by strain DG-02. Since no abiotic degradation of 3-PBA to these products was observed in cell-free control, the metabolism of 3-PBA was apparently initiated by enzymatic reactions. This is the first evidence of a novel pathway of degradation of 3-PBA by oxidization and cleavage of the diaryl ether in a microorganism, which plays an important role in the 3-PBA biogeocycle.</p><p>In our studies, strain DG-02 showed a high survivability in the environment and maximal degradation activity on 3-PBA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050456-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, the introduced strain DG-02 quickly adapted to the environment and rapidly bioremediated 3-PBA contaminated soils during the first incubation period (3 days), apparently there was no lag phase. At the end of the experiment, 90.1% and 95.2% of the added 3-PBA (50 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were removed from the sterilized and non-sterilized soils, respectively, and the <italic>t</italic>
<sub>1/2</sub> for 3-PBA was greatly reduced by 124.4 and 98.5 days as compared to the controls, respectively. Previous reports showed that the bacterial isolates introduced into the contaminated soil usually failed to degrade the pollutants due to the low activity of these bacteria caused by abiotic and biotic stresses, thus additional treatments were needed to enhance the degradation <xref rid="pone.0050456-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In this study, the bacterial isolate was found to efficiently degrade 3-PBA when inoculated into the soil, suggesting that strain DG-02 can be used directly for the elimination of 3-PBA in soil without any other further treatment. In addition, the removal efficiency of 3-PBA in the non-sterilized soil was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) than that in the sterilized soil, demonstrating that the indigenous soil microorganisms strongly stimulated the strain DG-02 to degrade 3-PBA. Enhancement of 3-PBA degradation could be explained by the fact that the introduced strain DG-02 and soil microorganisms may have a synergistic effect on metabolization of this recalcitrant, as described previously by Chen et al. <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050456-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, with the same soil as used in our study. Moreover, analysis of 3-PBA degradation products in soil indicated that the degradation of 3-PBA by strain DG-02 was accompanied by transient accumulation of protocatechuate, phenol, and 3,4-dimethoxy phenol, but they were subsequently degraded rapidly and disappeared finally, which was in line with the 3-PBA degradation in liquid medium.</p><p>In conclusion, strain DG-02 isolated in the present study was found highly efficient in degrading 3-PBA in different contaminated soils and water resources, thus suggesting the isolate may be a promising candidate for bioremediation of 3-PBA contaminated environments. This is the first report about biodegradation of 3-PBA by a bacterial strain from the <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus. Moreover, the bacterium harbors the metabolic pathway for the detoxification of 3-PBA. This is the first evidence of a novel pathway of degradation of 3-PBA by oxidization and cleavage of the diaryl ether in a microorganism, which plays an important role in the 3-PBA biogeocycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050456.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
