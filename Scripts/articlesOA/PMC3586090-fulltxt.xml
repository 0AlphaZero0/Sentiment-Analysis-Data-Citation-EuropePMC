Introduction</title><p>Tremelimumab (formerly ticilimumab) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, which is directed against human cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), it is also an interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulant. The antibody is being developed by Pfizer as an anticancer agent, which was generated using XenoMouse&#x02122; technology provided by Abgenix (now Amgen). Tremelimumab is in clinical development for the treatment of various cancers.</p><p>CTLA4 (CD152) is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells. In mice, T cell-mediated killing of tumors is enhanced by blocking the binding to CTLA4 of its natural ligands, such as B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which are expressed on antigen-presenting cells.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>1.1 Company Agreements</title><p>In January 2010, Pfizer and Debiopharm Group entered into a co-development agreement to conduct a phase III trial of tremelimumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable, stage IV melanoma. A biomarker will be used to select patients considered likely to respond to tremelimumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will assume responsibility for conducting the phase III trial of tremelimumab and Pfizer will retain responsibility for worldwide commercialization of the compound. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</p><p>In September 2004, Medarex and Pfizer signed a strategic alliance, and exchanged non-exclusive licenses to patents relating to antibodies to CTLA4. Pursuant to this license agreement, Medarex has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments based upon commercial sales of any Pfizer anti-CTLA4 antibody product, including tremelimumab.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>1.2 Key Development Milestones</title><p>A rollover protocol, phase II study (NCT00378482) intended to provide access to tremelimumab for patients who have previously received this drug in a clinical trial is taking place in the US and UK. This open-label study will enroll approximately 200 patients at locations in the US, Italy, and the UK, and will monitor long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>1.2.1 Bladder Cancer</title><p>In June 2009, Pfizer initiated an open-label phase I trial (NCT00880854) of tremelimumab in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) in patients with BCG-resistant, recurrent bladder cancer. This study will investigate the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of the therapy in approximately 24 patients in the US.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>1.2.2 Breast Cancer</title><p>According to the September 2008 Pfizer pipeline, a phase I trial was initiated in this indication.

The single-arm study was conducted at sites in the US and Canada. Patients received 15 mg/kg every 90 days via intravenous infusion until disease progression. The primary objective was response rate by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours) criteria. Secondary objectives included safety, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. A single patient, who had a stable ovarian mass and a substantial regression in an adrenal mass, received a second dose. The remaining 46 patients had disease progression or disease-related death before reaching the planned second dose at 3 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Following the completion of this trial in July 2008, no further development was reported and as the indication does not appear on the January 2010 Pfizer pipeline, development is presumed to have been discontinued.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>1.2.4 Gastrointestinal Cancer</title><p>According to Pfizer&#x02019;s pipeline dated March 2009, tremelimumab is in phase II clinical development for gastrointestinal cancers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>1.2.5 Liver Cancer</title><p>In December 2008, Pfizer initiated a phase II trial (NCT01008358) of tremelimumab in patients with late-stage unresectable liver cancer who also have hepatitis C infections. This primary endpoint of this single-armed study is the tumor response following therapy. The study will also evaluate changes in hepatitis C viral load. Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled in Spain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>1.2.6 Malignant Melanoma</title><p>Based on a co-development agreement with Pfizer, Debiopharm Group began planning a phase III trial of tremelimumab for the treatment of unresectable late-stage malignant melanoma using a biomarker to select individuals that might respond to the therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] According to the Debiopharm pipeline (accessed in June 2010), phase III development has begun.</p><p>A phase III trial of tremelimumab in combination with either dacarbazine or temozolomide in treatment-naive patients with surgically incurable metastatic melanoma was discontinued by Pfizer due to interim results not demonstrating superiority over standard chemotherapy. Overall survival was the primary endpoint.

This open-label study has reached its target enrollment of 34 patients and is being carried out in the US.</p><p>In August 2003, Pfizer initiated a phase I/II study (NCT00086489) evaluating the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels (10 and 15 mg/kg) of tremelimumab in 125 patients with advanced melanoma in the US. The endpoints are assessed every 2&#x02013;3 months up to 2 years from the first dose of tremelimumab.
