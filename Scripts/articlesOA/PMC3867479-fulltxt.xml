Previously, we demonstrated that HMGA1 is a key regulator of the insulin receptor (<italic>INSR</italic>) gene and an important downstream target of the INSR signaling cascade. Moreover, from a pathogenic point of view, overexpression of HMGA1 has been associated with human cancer, whereas functional variants of the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene have been recently linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. However, despite of this biological and pathological relevance, the mechanisms that control <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene expression remain unknown. In this study, to define the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene expression, the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene promoter was investigated by transient transfection of different cell lines, either before or after DNA and siRNA cotransfections. An octamer motif was identified as an important element of transcriptional regulation of this gene, the interaction of which with the octamer transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 is crucial in modulating <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene and protein expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that HMGA1 binds its own promoter and contributes to its transactivation by Oct-2 (but not Oct-1), supporting its role in an auto-regulatory circuit. Overall, our results provide insight into the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene, revealing a differential control exerted by both Oct-1 and Oct-2. Furthermore, they consistently support the hypothesis that a putative defect in Oct-1 and/or Oct-2, by affecting HMGA1 expression, may cause INSR dysfunction, leading to defects of the INSR signaling pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by MIUR Italy (protocol 2004062059-002).

Consistent with these latter findings, we have shown that defects in HMGA1 expression and/or function, by negatively affecting insulin receptor (INSR) signaling in insulin target tissues, may cause insulin resistance and increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0083969-Foti2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

However, despite this variety of studies, the mechanisms that regulate <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene expression are mostly unknown.</p><p>Cloning and characterization of the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene reveals a very complex structure <xref rid="pone.0083969-Friedmann1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Ogram1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, with a regulatory region comprising the untranslated exons 1&#x02013;3, lacking TATA and CAAT, but rich in G and C. Its complexity includes at least two transcription start sites and an extensive alternative mRNA splicing, particularly in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region <xref rid="pone.0083969-Friedmann1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Ogram1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, resembling the genes that are regulated without the preferential utilization of any specific start site <xref rid="pone.0083969-Asman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Instead, a preferential utilization of start site 2 has been demonstrated under certain experimental conditions, in which tight gene regulation is achieved, following the production of specific mRNA in response to different stimuli <xref rid="pone.0083969-Ogram1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the human <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene has been postulated before both in embryonic and cancer cells highly expressing HMGA1 <xref rid="pone.0083969-Cleynen2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It has been proposed that elevated expression of <italic>HMGA1</italic> in these cell models is mainly controlled by specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors, both of which seem to act as positive regulating elements, after binding to the transcription start site 1 and the transcription start site 2, respectively <xref rid="pone.0083969-Cleynen2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In the current study, we sought to further investigate the mechanisms that underlie <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene expression in different human and rat cell lines widely used in biochemical and molecular genetic studies of gene function and regulation. We report herein the identification of a new mechanism of regulation of the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene, which involves the octamer DNA motif &#x0201c;ATGCAAAT&#x0201d; originally described in immunoglobulin (<italic>Ig</italic>) gene regulation <xref rid="pone.0083969-Staudt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As a <italic>cis</italic>-acting transcriptional regulatory element found in both promoters and enhancers of a wide variety of ubiquitously expressed and cell type-specific genes, this octamer motif is specifically bound by a family of at least 11 distinct nuclear proteins, named octamer-binding (Oct) transcription factors, designated from Oct-1 to Oct-11 <xref rid="pone.0083969-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. All these factors are characterized by two Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) domains, in which the N-terminal subunit is known as the POU-specific (POUS) domain, while the C-terminal subunit is a homeo domain (POUH). Both domains are required for high-affinity, site-specific binding to the octamer motif, and mediate specific protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors or co-factors, thus activating or inhibiting gene expression <xref rid="pone.0083969-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Here, we focused our attention on the regulation of <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene transcription by the octamer-binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2, whose ubiquitous expression differ from other Oct proteins that exhibit, instead, a developmental and tissue-specific distribution <xref rid="pone.0083969-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our data indicate a role for Oct-1 and Oct-2 in regulating HMGA1 expression through direct interaction with the upstream <italic>HMGA1</italic> promoter region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells, protein extracts and Western Blot (WB)</title><p>HepG2 human hepatoma cells, and human cervix epithelioid carcinoma cells (HeLa) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

To determine specificity of DNA-protein binding, competition assays were performed. A 10-30-fold molar excess of either unlabeled fragment <italic>P3</italic> or unlabeled fragment <italic>P5</italic> considerably reduced the binding of labeled <italic>P3</italic> and labeled <italic>P5</italic> to the DNA binding proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083969-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Using DNA-protein interaction studies combined with ChIP coupled with qRT-PCR, we demonstrated a differential role for Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene which, in addition to the regulation of HMGA1 mRNA and protein expression, may contribute to the modulation of <italic>HMGA1</italic>-target genes. The observation that Oct-1 and Oct-2 differentially affect <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene expression by binding to the same octamer motif &#x0201c;ATGCAAAT&#x0201d; is consistent with previous reports, in which it has been demonstrated that both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to the same DNA sequence but may differ in their activation potential <xref rid="pone.0083969-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Schaffner1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Tanaka2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Cleary1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, here we show that, by facilitating the interaction of Oct-2 (but not Oct-1) with the <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene, HMGA1 enhances transactivation of its own promoter by this octamer transcription factor, providing evidence for the existence of an auto-regulatory circuit in which HMGA1 activates its own transcription. In relation to Oct-1, it needs to be considered that several isoforms of this transcription factor were described previously, each of which is active in a tissue-specific manner, being able to mediate different and even opposing effects <xref rid="pone.0083969-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, we cannot exclude that in other cells the effect of Oct-1 on HMGA1 may be different from that reported here in our work. In this regard, results have been provided indicating that Oct-1, NF-kappa B and HMGA1 cooperate for transactivation of the <italic>iNOS</italic> promoter in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells <xref rid="pone.0083969-Darville1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>As we previously reported, HMGA1 is a main activator of the <italic>INSR</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0083969-Foti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Brunetti2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and individuals with defects in HMGA1 have decreased INSR expression and increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0083969-Foti2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Also, we showed that, as a novel downstream nuclear target of the INSR signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, HMGA1 represents an important novel mediator of glucose disposal and glucose homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Iiritano1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, based on these observations and the results from the present study indicating that a functional relation can be established between HMGA1, Oct-1 and Oct-2 in the context of the <italic>INSR</italic> gene, it is tempting to hypothesize that a putative defect in these nuclear proteins may cause INSR dysfunction with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action. In this regard, an association between <italic>Oct-1</italic> gene variants and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which may support this intriguing hypothesis, has been reported <xref rid="pone.0083969-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Moreover, recent evidences suggest that Oct-1 may play a role in metabolic homeostasis by acting as a sensor for cAMP (cyclic AMP). In particular, elevation of cAMP in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells reduces nuclear Oct-1 content <xref rid="pone.0083969-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and this is consistent with previous observations indicating that expression of HMGA1 increases in response to cAMP <xref rid="pone.0083969-Chiefari1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083969-Bianconcini1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, thus suggesting that increased HMGA1 expression could be due, at least in part, to the reduction of Oct-1 content.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings from this study reveal new mechanistic insight into the transcriptional mechanisms governing <italic>HMGA1</italic> gene expression. While additional investigations will be needed to further define the roles of Oct-1 and Oct-2 in HMGA1 expression in other cell systems and models, these results provide a paradigm to suggest other types of molecule, Oct-1 and Oct-2, in addition to HMGA1, which should be searched for in investigations designed to elucidate the causes of impairment of INSR signaling in humans with INSR dysfunction and insulin resistance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Winship Herr (Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland), for providing expression plasmids encoding Oct-1 and Oct-2.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0083969-Johnson1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
