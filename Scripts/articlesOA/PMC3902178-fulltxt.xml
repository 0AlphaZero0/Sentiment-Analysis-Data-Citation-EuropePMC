It is associated with translocation of microbial products, thereby contributing to the systemic immune activation seen in patients living with HIV-1 [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In diseases such as Crohn&#x02019;s disease and ulcerative colitis, bacterial flagellin has been pinpointed to be of major pathogenetic importance, and high plasma levels of immunoglobulins (IgG) directed towards this bacterial antigen are present [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We and others have reported increased plasma levels of microbial translocated products in patients living with HIV-1 who live in high-income countries, which decrease during antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Also, we have suggested that various drug combinations may have different outcomes in terms of improvement of the microbial translocation (MT) markers in patients living with HIV-1 [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, the role of MT in the HIV epidemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains controversial and not well studied. It has been suggested that MT is important for HIV disease progression in Africa [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but this has been disputed [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, increased MT has been reported in South African subjects before ART, but it remained elevated during efficient therapy [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In order to obtain more knowledge about MT in LMICs, we sought to evaluate to which extent Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients living with HIV-1 demonstrate higher levels of biomarkers for MT and if efficient ART influenced these levels in the Vietnamese patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Study populations</title><p>The study populations were obtained from three countries: Vietnam, Ethiopia and Sweden (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>).

The selected 83 patients had similar demographic and laboratory characteristics as the whole cohort (data not shown). Twenty-four subjects had ongoing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed two months before inclusion in the study and had been given tuberculostatics for two months (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide), with an efficient therapeutic response to the TB therapy, before starting ART [stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) plus nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV)]. In six of these subjects, treatment continued for an additional ten months, while remaining 18 subjects received only six months of treatment (isoniazid and ethambutol). Clinical information for all subjects was obtained from their physician during follow-up. All patients had undetectable HIV load at 24-month follow-up. Plasma samples were drawn before ART and in 38 cases at 24-month follow-up, and they were thereafter stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Fifty healthy HIV-negative Ethiopian controls who were matched with regard to socioeconomics, age and sex, all living in Addis Ababa in the same geographical region, were included as controls. No follow-up data with clinical information or follow-up samples were available. From Sweden, 51 treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients living with HIV-1 followed at Karolinska University Hospital were included for comparative purposes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>) along with 19 healthy HIV-negative Caucasian Swedish individuals, all living in the capital city of Stockholm with a good socioeconomic situation.

Discussion</title><p>The present study of patients living with HIV-1 from Vietnam and Ethiopia gives support to the view that MT is an important feature of the HIV-1 disease in LMICs [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the levels of anti-flagellin IgG, LPS and sCD14 were increased in the patients living with HIV-1 from both Vietnam and Ethiopia as compared to HIV-negative controls from the same geographical regions and socioeconomic grouping. Also, patients living with HIV-1 from Vietnam and Ethiopia had higher levels of anti-flagellin IgG and LPS as compared to patients living in Sweden. It can be argued that significant differences existed in, for example, CD4+ T-cells between the patients from the different countries, but the differences also persisted after multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, sex and CD4+ T-cells). It is thus possible that these differences are related to other factors such as different compositions of the gut microbiota and the food intake, poorer hygiene and sanitation and/or frequent exposure to other gastrointestinal infections. Also, another factor that may play an important role for these differences is the viral clade. It is not unreasonable to assume that clade diversity may play an important role in HIV immune activation as a result of MT. Since the viral heterogeneity in our cohorts was limited, the present study did not allow us to evaluate the impact of subtypes on MT. However, it is worth exploring further, and we aim to investigate this aspect in the future.</p><p>Higher levels of MT are likely to result in differences in immune activation and thereby to have a profound effect on the host immune profiles afflicting patients living with HIV-1 in LMICs [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast to the LPS and anti-flagellin levels, the sCD14 level was highest in the Vietnamese patients, which could be related to the fact that 30% of them were co-infected with TB, which was not the case for the Ethiopian and Swedish patients. Consistent with these observations, Toossi <italic>et al</italic>. found that the level of sCD14 in Ugandan patients living with both HIV and TB was higher than in subjects living with HIV only [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>It is well established that effective ART reduces MT and immune activation in patients living with HIV-1 who live in high-income countries [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The knowledge concerning patients from LMICs is limited to one South African study reporting that increased MT was found before ART and that it decreased but remained elevated during efficient therapy [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our study, the Vietnamese patients, in whom we had follow-up samples, had undetectable virus after two years of ART [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A concomitant decrease in the MT markers was seen, suggesting that ART improves the gut&#x02013;blood barrier damage also found in patients from these surroundings.</p><p>A subgroup of the Vietnamese patients (<italic>n</italic>=24) had been treated for two months with tuberculostatics with efficient response. Indeed, we found that these patients had lower anti-flagellin IgG and a tendency to lower LPS. It has been shown that antibiotics decrease the MT in monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and we have reported that a similar effect is seen in humans living with HIV-1 [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is thus possible that the tuberculostatics had induced changes in the gut microbiota, resulting in a decreased MT. We therefore recommend that any ongoing antibiotic treatment should be considered when MT is studied. In contrast, the sCD14 level was higher than in the patients without tuberculostatics. It is not unlikely that this discrepancy is related to an increased immune activation seen due to remaining disease activity of the TB, since the TB treatment had been given for only two months. Also, we cannot exclude that the increased immune activation was related to other ongoing subclinical OIs. Thus, sCD14 is a biomarker not only for MT but also for other immune activation processes.</p><p>We also analyzed the association between the biomarkers and the clinical outcome. As expected, a higher viral load and lower CD4+ T-cells correlated to an increased mortality. Also, the results were consistent with earlier reports noting that higher levels of sCD14 are associated with a poorer clinical outcome [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consistently, patients who did not develop a new OI or died had significantly lower levels of LPS, anti-flagellin IgG as well as sCD14. This finding is in line with the possibility that a more pronounced MT may lead to increased immune activation with an associated poorer immunological response to other infections, including OIs.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that treatment-na&#x000ef;ve Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients living with HIV have elevated biomarkers of MT as compared to HIV-negative controls from the same geographical regions and also compared to patients living in Sweden. Also, in the Vietnamese patients the MT was reduced following 2 years of ART. Further investigations of the role of MT in patients living with HIV from LMICs can contribute to an increased understanding of the HIV disease in such countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The role of MT for HIV disease progression in patients living in resource-limited settings is controversial.
