The VirB/D4 system from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> is a typical T4SS. It facilitates the bacteria to translocate the VirD2-T-DNA complex to the host cell cytoplasm. In addition to protein-DNA complexes, the VirB/D4 system is also involved in the translocation of several effector proteins, including VirE2, VirE3 and VirF into the host cell cytoplasm. These effector proteins aid in the proper integration of the translocated DNA into the host genome. The VirD2-binding protein (VBP) is a key cytoplasmic protein that recruits the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex to the VirD4-coupling protein (VirD4 CP) of the VirB/D4 T4SS apparatus. Here, we report the crystal structure and associated functional studies of the C-terminal domain of VBP. This domain mainly consists of &#x003b1;-helices, and the two monomers of the asymmetric unit form a tight dimer. The structural analysis of this domain confirms the presence of a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) fold. Biophysical studies show that VBP is a dimer in solution and that the HEPN domain is the dimerization domain. Based on structural and mutagenesis analyses, we show that substitution of key residues at the interface disrupts the dimerization of both the HEPN domain and full-length VBP. In addition, pull-down analyses show that only dimeric VBP can interact with VirD2 and VirD4 CP. Finally, we show that only <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> harboring dimeric full-length VBP can induce tumors in plants. This study sheds light on the structural basis of the substrate recruiting function of VBP in the T4SS pathway of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and in other pathogenic bacteria employing similar systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>
<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> causes crown gall disease (tumors) in agriculturally important plant species. It initiates infection through its Ti plasmid, which integrates a portion of its own DNA (T-DNA) into that of the host genome. The T-DNA is bound to VirD2 relaxase, and this complex is required for the efficient translocation and integration of the T-DNA into the plant genome for tumor formation. Two additional proteins, among others, are also required for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> tumorigenesis: VirD4-coupling protein (CP) and VirD2-binding protein (VBP). VBP is responsible for recruiting VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA to VirD4 CP to help localize T-DNA to the Type IV Secretion System apparatus for transfer. However, it is still unclear how VBP recruits the complex to VirD4 CP. Here, we report the crystal structure and associated functional studies of the C-terminal domain of VBP. We show that the C-terminal domain is the dimerization domain of VBP and only dimeric VBP is functional and essential for the induction of tumor in plants. This study enhances the understanding of the role of VBP in recruiting VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA in <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> prior to its transfer into the host plant. This mode of action can be extended to other pathogenic bacteria employing similar secretion systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially supported by a Biomedical Research Council Grant (WBS R154000461305) from the Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, awarded to JS.

T4SS can translocate not only proteins but also DNA to phylogenetically diverse taxa, including many bacterial species and various eukaryotic cells, as well as import and export DNA from the extracellular milieu. The T4SS shares a common ancestry with bacterial conjugation systems <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Cascales1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, with three types of T4SS described to date: (1) conjugation systems, defined as machines that translocate DNA substrates to recipient cells by a contact-dependent process; (2) effector translocation systems, functioning to deliver proteins or other effector molecules to eukaryotic target cells; and (3) DNA release or uptake systems, which translocate DNA to or from the extracellular milieu <xref rid="ppat.1003948-AlvarezMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The VirB/D4 secretion system of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> is a typical example of a T4SS, which serves as both a conjugation and an effector translocation system. Conjugation systems within the T4SS facilitate the translocation of protein-DNA complexes from the bacterium into the cytoplasm of the host cell. For instance, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> translocates to the host cell a segment of the Ti (tumor inducing) plasmid between the right and left borders (T-DNA) in complex with a cytoplasmic relaxase protein (VirD2) <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Lessl1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Proteins involved in T-DNA processing and translocation are classified into three functionally distinct classes <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Christie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Class I constitutes proteins involved in the processing of the DNA intermediates, such as VirC1, VirC2, VirD1 and VirD2 relaxase <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Tzfira1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. VirC1 and VirC2 proteins assemble the relaxosomal complex at the border sequences of the Ti plasmid and initiate T-DNA processing <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Atmakuri1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, whereas VirD2 relaxase, when present in the relaxosomal complex, cleaves the bottom strand of the T-DNA, where it remains covalently attached to the 5&#x02032; end of the single-stranded T-DNA <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Cascales2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Class II comprises 11 VirB proteins that form the T4SS apparatus which is responsible for the translocation of the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex and the effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Christie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Class III constitutes the coupling proteins (CP), which mediate the interaction between the substrate (VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex) and the transport apparatus <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Christie2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. VirD4 CP, the coupling protein in the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> VirB/D4 system, is an inner membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain essential for the transfer of both the T-DNA strand and VirE2 to host cells <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003948-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex and VirE2 are translocated separately <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Cascales2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Veluthambi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Atmakuri2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The translocated effector proteins&#x02014; VirE2, VirE3 and VirF which are involved in nuclear targeting, import and integration of the T-DNA into the host genome&#x02014;mediate the interactions between the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex and host cellular factors <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Cascales1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In particular, VirE2 coats single-stranded T-DNA and protects it from host cell nucleases <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Citovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, whereas both VirE2 and VirD2 carry the nuclear localization signals that aid in the nuclear import of the T-DNA. VirE2 also interacts with host cell proteins, such as VIP1 and VIP2 <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Tzfira2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. VIP1 and VIP2 localize to plant nuclei and probably facilitate delivery of the T-DNA complex to its site of integration <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Tzfira2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> VirF, on the other hand, localizes in the host nucleus and targets VIP1 and VirE2 for proteolysis and thus uncoats the T-DNA from its cognate proteins. This uncoating mechanism is a crucial step that must occur prior to integration of the T-DNA in the host genome <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Tzfira3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex forms in the bacterial cytoplasm, but there is no evidence to suggest that VirD4 CP can recruit the bulky substrate complex to the T4SS apparatus <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Guo2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In 2007, Guo <italic>et al.</italic> reported the existence of a subset of proteins defined as &#x02018;recruiting proteins&#x02019; that are involved in bringing the nucleoprotein substrate complex formed in the bacterial cytoplasm to the VirD4 CP. The VirD2-binding protein (VBP) was subsequently identified as a key protein belonging to this subset and was shown to recruit the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex to the VirD4 CP <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have indeed shown that the interaction between VBP and VirD2 is important for T-DNA transfer <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, with VBP interacting with both the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA complex and with several of the T4SS components independently, including VirD4 CP, VirB4 and VirB11. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which VBP recruits the complex to VirD4 CP remains unknown.</p><p>
<italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> is a gram-negative bacteria that causes crown gall disease (tumor formation) in over 140 species of dicots <xref rid="ppat.1003948-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.Despite this negative role, researchers have started to exploit the ability of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> to infiltrate and infect other organisms to create transgenic plants. Thus, given the importance of this bacterium in both crop infection and as a research tool, we sought to better understand how VBP recruits the protein-DNA complex to VirD4 CP by exploring the structure of VBP.</p><p>Here we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of VBP along with its functional studies. We show that the two monomers of the asymmetric unit form a tight anti-parallel dimer, with the dimerization confirmed by solution studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that this C-terminal domain is the dimerization domain of full-length VBP. Pull-down analyses and plant virulence assays showed that only <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> harboring dimeric VBP can interact with the key proteins to induce tumor formation in plants. These studies broaden our understanding about the role of VBP in the VirD2&#x02013;T-DNA transfer from <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> to the plant cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overall structure</title><p>We initially attempted to crystallize full-length VBP with intact N- and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003948-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Peptide-mass finger printing analysis on the crystals showed that only the C-terminal domain of VBP had crystallized. The boundaries of the crystallized protein were determined using N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis. Subsequently, we generated a new construct that consisted of the C-terminal domain, and obtained crystals that diffracted up to 2.7 &#x000c5; resolution. The structure was determined using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003948-t001">Table 1</xref>).The asymmetric unit consists of two monomers forming a tight dimer. Each monomer contains a six-helix bundle with three long anti-parallel &#x003b1; helices (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, and &#x003b1;6) that forms the major part of this domain, and three shorter helices (&#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5) that stack at an angle to the long helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003948-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003948.s001">Figure S1A, S1B</xref>). The monomers are arranged as anti-parallel dimers with a large buried surface area of 1203 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (or 14% of the total surface area of each monomer).
