Development of new therapeutic strategies to combat the economic impact of neosporosis remains an important scientific endeavor. This study demonstrates molecular, structural and phenotypic evidence that <italic>N. caninum</italic> calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (<italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1) is a promising molecular target for neosporosis drug development. Recombinant <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 was expressed, purified and screened against a select group of bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) previously shown to have low IC<sub>50s</sub> against <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> CDPK1 and <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites. <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 was inhibited by low concentrations of BKIs. The three-dimensional structure of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 in complex with BKIs was studied crystallographically. The BKI-<italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 structures demonstrated the structural basis for potency and selectivity. Calcium-dependent conformational changes in solution as characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering are consistent with previous structures in low Calcium-state but different in the Calcium-bound active state than predicted by X-ray crystallography. BKIs effectively inhibited <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoite proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Electron microscopic analysis of <italic>N. caninum</italic> cells revealed ultra-structural changes in the presence of BKI compound 1294. BKI compound 1294 interfered with an early step in <italic>Neospora</italic> tachyzoite host cell invasion and egress. Prolonged incubation in the presence of 1294 interfered produced observable interference with viability and replication. Oral dosing of BKI compound 1294 at 50 mg/kg for 5 days in established murine neosporosis resulted in a 10-fold reduced cerebral parasite burden compared to untreated control. Further experiments are needed to determine the PK, optimal dosage, and duration for effective treatment in cattle and dogs, but these data demonstrate proof-of-concept for BKIs, and 1294 specifically, for therapy of bovine and canine neosporosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants (1 R01 AI089441 and 5 R01 AI080625 to WCVV) and (R01GM086858 to DJM).

A recent estimate of neosporosis-induced abortions in cattle from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Spain, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the USA suggests an annual economic impact in excess of 1.2 billion USD <xref rid="pone.0092929-Reichel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>N. caninum</italic> related diseases have also been reported in other livestock species, including sheep, goats, horses and deer <xref rid="pone.0092929-Dubey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092929-Dubey2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> with canids such as dogs, wolves and coyotes being the definitive hosts <xref rid="pone.0092929-McAllister1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092929-Lindsay1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, neosporosis represents a major veterinary health and economic concern. Neoguard, a killed tachyzoite lysate and the only vaccine that has been marketed to date, was reported in one publication to reduce the abortion rate in cattle by approximately 50% <xref rid="pone.0092929-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> but does not induce protection against fetal infection in cattle. However, more recent trials revealed fewer efficacies in the field, and even suggested that vaccination may increase the risk of early embryonic death <xref rid="pone.0092929-Weston1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, the vaccine has been taken off the market. The application of live attenuated vaccines, although potentially more efficacious, carries the risk of early embryonic death as a result of potential reversion to virulence <xref rid="pone.0092929-Weston1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Chemotherapy could provide a viable alternative if appropriate compounds are identified. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been performed to determine efficacy of treatments with lasalocid, monensin, pirithrexim, pyrimethamine, clindamycin, robenidine and trimethoprim <xref rid="pone.0092929-Lindsay2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, artemisinin and artemisone <xref rid="pone.0092929-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092929-Mazuz1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, depudecin <xref rid="pone.0092929-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, toltrazuril, and ponazuril <xref rid="pone.0092929-Darius1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> although none of these studies showed that treatments were actually effective in cattle. To date there is no approved vaccine and no approved treatment for cattle that are infected with <italic>N. caninum</italic>.</p><p>A study on prophylactic administration of toltrazuril in newborn calves suggests some degree of protection based on serological response data <xref rid="pone.0092929-Kritzner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but protection has never been proven. Treatment with prolonged administration of clindamycin or potentiated sulfa drugs (in combination with trimethoprim) were only successful in eliminating clinical signs in less than 40% cases of canine neosporosis <xref rid="pone.0092929-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Clearly, a new and more efficacious therapeutic is needed to reduce the economic impact of neosporosis on farmers and the global economy. We recently demonstrated that apicomplexan calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are promising drug targets, as observed from excellent correlations between cell-activity and enzyme inhibition by compounds from a focused bumped kinase inhibitor (BKI) library as well as chemical-genetic validation <xref rid="pone.0092929-Ojo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092929-CastellanosGonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> CDPK1 (<italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1) (TGME49_101440) has been reported to be associated with host cell invasion processes <xref rid="pone.0092929-Ojo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092929-Kieschnick1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 has the smallest possible gatekeeper amino acid in the ATP binding site, glycine. Most BKIs have bulky C3 aryl substituents that project into a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the glycine gatekeeper in the ATP binding site. BKIs selectively inhibit <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 but don't inhibit mammalian kinases because mammalian kinases have larger gatekeeper residues that block the entry of the bulky C3 aryl substitution into the adjacent hydrophobic pocket. <italic>N. caninum</italic> is similar to <italic>T. gondii</italic> in its ability to invade a large variety of cells <xref rid="pone.0092929-Hemphill1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092929-Hemphill3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and their genomes are highly similar as well. The two parasites share a conserved core proteome, similar core biochemical processes, and 99% CDPK1 amino acid sequence identity including a glycine gatekeeper residue. Thus, it seems likely that BKIs, which efficiently inhibit host cell invasion in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, will also block <italic>N. caninum</italic> invasion and growth. However, it is necessary to test the function of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 as divergence of functions or pathways may have occurred.</p><p>In this report, we describe the biochemical, structural, and biophysical aspects of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 enzyme and the nanomolar potency of BKIs in the inhibition of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1. The effect of BKI inhibitors on <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoite proliferation and development were determined. Seven of the tested BKIs exhibit low-to-mid nanomolar activity against <italic>N. caninum</italic> proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, making them good candidates for therapeutic investigation. A therapeutic oral trial with a BKI, 1294, demonstrated marked reduction of <italic>N. caninum</italic> cerebral parasite burden in mice, thus demonstrating proof-of-concept for neosporosis therapy. Thus, our studies define a strategy for the development of potent and safe <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 inhibitors that could form the basis of a novel neosporosis treatment regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>In vitro activity of BKIs against NcCDPK1 enzyme activity and N. caninum proliferation</title><p>The potency of 8 BKIs against recombinant <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 kinase activity was evaluated.

Though there are not many BKIs tested yet, there is a good correlation between potency <italic>in vitro</italic> towards <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 inhibition and <italic>N. caninum</italic> growth.

<italic>NcCDPK1</italic> is 96% sequence identical to the well-studied <italic>TgCDPK1</italic>. The active site environment of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 differs at only amino acid position 123 having tyrosine rather than phenylalanine at <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 residue 124. This change does not alter the binding surface in the active site, but may act to slightly rigidify the active site conformation by introducing a new hydrogen bonding interaction between residues Tyr 123 and Glu 88. The observed binding pose of the pyrazolopyrimidine (PP) scaffold and the R1 substituent &#x0201c;bump&#x0201d; in the inhibitor complexes studied here is entirely consistent with that seen previously for PP-scaffold inhibitors bound to the <italic>T. gondii</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure S1 and S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092929.s001">File S1</xref>). Compound 1266 <xref rid="pone.0092929-Ojo2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> is approximately 200 fold less effective at inhibiting CDPK1s relative to other BKIs shown in the study probably due to its distinctive quinoxaline R1 ring system rather than the common naphthalene, quinoline, or isoquinoline R1 group. A three-dimensional (3-D) model of CDPK1 with 1266 predicted that the quinoxaline nitrogen at position 9 (N9) is oriented toward the carbonyl oxygen of residue valine 78 (3.3 &#x000c5; distance). This would have been quite favorable for additional hydrogen bonding if the N9 was hydrogen. However, a quinoxaline nitrogen may not have a proton at pH values above 1, making this an unfavorable interaction because the carbonyl oxygen of residue valine 78 and the N9 pay a price in solvation energy by facing each other rather than solvent waters. Data from this study confirmed that the model for the structural basis of potency and specificity developed for the optimization of potential anti-toxoplasmosis drugs based on this scaffold is also applicable to optimization of anti-neosporosis drugs <xref rid="pone.0092929-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092929-Larson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The pose of the piperidine R2 substituent in the current structures is similar but not identical to that seen in <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 complexes with other inhibitors containing piperidine ring substituents at this position, which in turn are not identical to each other. This argues for flexibility in the orientation of the piperidine substituents even after binding of these nanomolar inhibitors, and allows additional chemical modifications of this group if necessary to further optimize PK/AMDET properties.</p><fig id="pone-0092929-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0092929.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>a: Binding pose of pyrazolopyrimidine analogues in complexes <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1.</title><p>The crystallographically observed binding poses of inhibitors RM-1-132 (15n) and 1294 (15o).

The crystallographic and SAXS models agree better for the low calcium state (left) than for the high calcium state (right). The model for the high calcium state derived from the observed SAXS profile (gray solid) is more extended, i.e. has a larger radius of gyration, than the crystal structure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0092929.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent conformational state in solution</title><p>The structure of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 as seen in both the apo and inhibitor-bound crystals is consistent with the &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; forms previously seen in calcium-free crystal structures of CDPK1 homologs from <italic>C. parvum</italic> (ApiDB_CryptoDB:cgd3_920) and <italic>T. gondii</italic> (TGME49_101440). In this conformational state the C-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain forms a compact structure that occludes the active site of the N-terminal kinase domain, thus preventing the recognition or phosphorylation of substrate proteins. Intracellular regulation of CDPK activity is believed to be mediated by a radical conformational rearrangement that occurs in the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is supported by previous crystal structures of calcium-bound states of <italic>C. parvum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> homologs <xref rid="pone.0092929-Wernimont1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, but direct measurement of CDPK conformational states in solution has not been previously reported. Therefore we undertook characterization of the low- and high- (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) conformational states of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).</p><p>As predicted from crystal structures of the low and high calcium conformations of <italic>TgCDPK1</italic>, the solution X-ray scattering profiles for <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 in the two states are significantly different, as are the derived conformational models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However while there is good agreement between the SAXS and crystallographic models for the low-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state, both the radius of gyration and the envelope of the SAXS reconstruction indicate a high-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state in solution that is less compact than was captured in previous crystal structures of homologous CDPKs with bound calcium.</p><p>The scattering profile for the low-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state in solution indicates a 29.1&#x000b1;2.3 &#x000c5; radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>). Direct reconstruction of the implied conformational state is consistent with the low-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state seen in the current <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 crystal structures and with the previously reported calcium-free crystal structures of CDPK1 homologs. This agreement is also shown by the good correlation cc&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.88 between the observed scattering curve and the curve predicted from the apo <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 crystal structure. The scattering profile for the high-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state in solution indicates a radius of gyration Rg&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;35.1&#x000b1;1.8 &#x000c5;, significantly larger than that observed for the low-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state. Direct reconstruction of the implied high-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) conformational state in solution yields a model that is distinctly different from the reconstruction of the low-(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) state.

Only a single relatively compact state from this range is favored, or stabilized, during formation of the crystal lattice. An equivalent discrepancy between the observed crystalline and solution states of the calcium-binding motifs in calmodulin is well-known <xref rid="pone.0092929-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Its greatest impact is associated with the early stage of the host cell-parasite interaction. When 1294 was added to cultures at the timepoint where HFF infection with <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites was initiated, and incubated for 2 hours before removal by washing, there was a significant decrease in beta-galactosidase activity compared to experiments where compound 1266 <xref rid="pone.0092929-Ojo2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> (negative, low-potency control) or DMSO were assessed (t-test; p&#x0003c;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). With subsequent addition of 1294 at 60, 90 and 115 minutes after initiation of HFF infection, there was no significant difference in beta-galactosidase activity, and no difference could be seen when 1294 was added after the infection phase of 2 hours had ended (p&#x0003e;0.2). SEM of HFF monolayers infected with <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites either in the presence or absence of compound 1294 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g003">Figure 3B&#x02013;D</xref>) and subsequently maintained in the presence of 1294 for 3 days showed that proliferation of parasites was markedly inhibited when the compound was added during the infection phase, but not when 1294 was added after infection has taken place. In other experiments involving <italic>in vitro</italic> 1294 treatment of infected HFF for up to 12 days, however, we could show that the effects mediated by 1294 are not only restricted to the inhibition of host cell entry. Continuous inspection by light microscopy showed that intracellular <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites did initially undergo proliferation in the presence of 2.5 &#x003bc;M 1294, but lysis of host cells was evident only in a few instances. However, from day 5 post infection onwards in the presence of 2.5 &#x003bc;M 1294, no extracellular tachyzoites were visible (data not shown). To assess whether any viable parasites remained, after 12 days of continuous 1294 treatment the infected HFF cultures were trypsinized and were further cultivated with a fresh monolayer in the absence of compound 1294. Some tachyzoites resumed proliferation and host cell lysis occurred again within 3 days, leading to complete lysis of monolayers within one week (data not shown). This indicated that the interference of compound 1294 with <italic>N. caninum</italic> development was not completely parasiticidal under the conditions used in this experiment. However, this experiment was not quantitative and did not distinguish whether a substantial fraction of the parasites were non-viable.

On one hand, we observed parasitophorous vacuoles containing numerous and densely packed tachyzoites similar to the ones observed in untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g005">Figure 5A and B</xref>), indicating that the compound did not have any profound effects on the intracellular development of <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites. However, in many instances, vacuoles were seen that contained parasites with an enlarged cytoplasmic mass and aberrant overall morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>), and also vacuoles containing typically a lower number of parasites exhibiting signs of metabolic impairment such as cytoplasmic vacuolization and electron-dense inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g005">Figure 5E and F</xref>). More pronounced alterations were visible at day 5 of drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g006">Figure 6</xref>). On one hand, largely destroyed parasites were observed intracellularly, located still within a parasitophorous vacuole, but the matrix of this vacuole was becoming electron dense and granular in appearance, and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane was not clearly discernible anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>). On the other hand, numerous infected HFF contained complexes of still viable and presumably proliferating, but non-separating, parasites forming a large multi-nucleated mass within a parasitophorous vacuole clearly delineated and separated from the host cell cytoplasm by a membrane. Interestingly these complexes often contained several smaller nuclei in addition to an outstandingly enlarged nucleus with a respectively enlarged nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The two contrasting phenomena were sometimes seen within the same host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). At day 9 of 1294 treatment, these multinucleated complexes increased in size, and the matrix of the parasitophorous vacuole has completely lost the characteristics of a tubular membranous network and was replaced by components of more granular and vesicular appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g006">Figure 6D and E</xref>). In many instances, however, the ultrastructure of these parasite complexes was severely damaged and only residual, non-viable complexes were seen, located within an electron-dense matrix. Under the conditions used here, the cultures were completely lysed at time points later than day 4, so it was impossible to show a control, because this will contain mostly extracellular (and dying) parasites. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that compound 1294 does not only affect host cell invasion, but that this compound does also interfere in separation of zoites once nuclear division and cytoplasmic duplication has taken place, resulting in the appearance of large, multi-nucleated masses, which are, however, still viable. Once the compound is removed, these effects are most likely reversible, and division of tachyzoites proceeds, resulting in lysis of the host cells.</p><fig id="pone-0092929-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0092929.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>TEM analysis of <italic>N. caninum</italic>-infected HFF cultures treated for 3 days, with 2.5 &#x003bc;M of inhibitor 1294 added at 2 h post-infection.</title><p>A and B show micrographs of more or less densely packed parasitophorous vacuoles containing numerous tachyzoites without obvious alterations.

<italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> are obligate intracellular parasites that must invade the host cell to grow and replicate. Proliferation occurs after successful invasion of a host cell by a complex process of coordinated secretion of proteins regulated in part by changes in intracellular calcium concentrations. Cell invasion, in this case, is independent of host calcium control systems but relies on a calcium-regulated secretion pathway in the parasite <xref rid="pone.0092929-Lovett1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092929-Lovett2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> directed in part by CDPKs.

By extrapolating from <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 functional characteristics, it would be anticipated that inhibitors of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 would be sufficient to interrupt the growth and proliferation of <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites by preventing host cell invasion and/or egress. Nonetheless, potential functional divergence between <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 and <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 combined with the distinct range of mammalian host systems in which the parasites operate warrants detailed understanding of possible differences in their molecular structure and specific phenotypic response to their inhibition by BKIs.</p><p>This study presents the first crystal structures of parasitic protozoan <italic>N. caninum</italic> CDPK1 enzyme.

Earlier observations strongly suggest that the vicinity of the ribose pocket can serve as an additional potency and selectivity-determining region especially in BKI analogues with a piperidine R<sub>2</sub> group <xref rid="pone.0092929-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092929-Larson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Furthermore the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis presented in this study constitutes the first direct characterization of the calcium-responsive conformational rearrangement of CDPK1 in solution. As previously found for the structurally similar calcium-binding domain of calmodulin, the calcium-bound form of CDPK1 observed in solution is less compact than the calcium-bound form of the same protein observed crystallographically. The implied multiplicity of calcium-bound states is entirely compatible with our understanding of the mechanism of calcium-regulated kinase activity, in which the calcium-induced rearrangement displaces structural elements that limit access to the active site. However it indicates that previous crystal structures of CDPK1 calcium-bound states do not represent a single biologically active conformation present in solution. By contrast, the SAXS profile for the calcium-free state in solution is consistent with the crystal structures of the calcium-free state of <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 and <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 used to interpret structure-activity relationships. Thus structural studies of CDPK enzymes in complex with BKIs together with computational modeling have been useful in guiding synthetic chemistry for lead optimization by predicting functional groups needed to improve potency, selectivity and further optimize PK/ADME properties.</p><p>We have experimental evidence that <italic>N. caninum</italic> is prevented from invading the mammalian host cell when lead compound 1294 is added at the time of infection. By EM and light microscopy, some parasites treated with 1294 after infection appear viable, but appear to be unable to lyse the HFF host cells.

More precisely, the data suggests additional effects of BKIs on molecular target(s) that control(s) separation of tachyzoites during replication, which results in either parasites dying off intracellularly, or seemingly viable parasites forming large multinucleated complexes. In other instances, these complexes also show signs of metabolic impairment. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature or experimental evidence of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1 or <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1 involvement in transducing signals needed in metabolic pathways or cell division. However, egress impediment induced stress from 1294 treatment of <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoite infected HFF cells could be a potential indirect cause or unrelated to inhibition of <italic>Nc</italic>CDPK1. It is also possible that the difference in potency or phenotypic effect on <italic>N. caninum</italic> versus <italic>T. gondii</italic> is due to the presence of a second target kinase in <italic>N. caninum</italic>. Comparison of the respective genomes argues against this, however. The most plausible off-target activity would be recognition of another small-gatekeeper kinase. Seven such kinases can be found in the <italic>N. caninum</italic> genome, but in each case the protein is directly homologous (E value &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;e&#x02227;-100 or better) to a <italic>T. gondii</italic> kinase whose sequence contains that same small gatekeeper residue.

When infected HFF were treated with 1294 for 12 days, followed by passage by trypsinization to remove the compound, proliferation of tachyzoites resumed, indicating that the drug is not parasiticidal <italic>in vitro</italic>. Rather the trypsin may release the viable tachyzoites, which can re-establish infection. However, it is unclear what specific percentage of intracellular tachyzoites was damaged due to the prolonged exposure to 1294; it is only clear that some of the tachyzoites are viable and can re-establish infection.</p><p>Compound 1294 was recently shown to be a highly selective inhibitor for parasites' CDPKs compared with 80 mammalian kinases <xref rid="pone.0092929-Ojo3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> presumably due to smaller gatekeeper residues in CDPKs and other interactions in the CDPKs active sites <xref rid="pone.0092929-Larson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Other enzymes in the <italic>N. caninum</italic> kinome with small gatekeeper residues, that compound 1294 could potentially inhibit, include <italic>Nc</italic>CamK (NCLIV_046430) with an alanine gatekeeper, <italic>Nc</italic>AGC like kinase (NCLIV_016060) with a serine gatekeeper, <italic>Nc</italic>ROP like kinase (NCLIV_030990) with a threonine gatekeeper, and <italic>Nc</italic>MAPK-3 (NCLIV_056080) with a serine gatekeeper. <italic>Nc</italic>MAPK-3 is a <italic>Tg</italic>MAPK-1 (TGME49_312570) ortholog with highly conserved kinase domain of &#x0003e;80% identity. <italic>Tg</italic>MAPK-1 been shown to play some role in sister parasite <italic>T. gondii</italic> stress response <xref rid="pone.0092929-Brumlik1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, cell division <xref rid="pone.0092929-Sugi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It is unclear to what extent compound 1294 could impact these targets, but sensitivity is postulated to be related to the size of the respective enzymes' gatekeeper residue in the order alanine&#x0003e;serine&#x0003e;threonine. Intracellular damage to tachyzoites may be concentration dependent probably due to different levels of sensitivity of prospective <italic>N. caninum</italic> off-target enzymes to compound 1294.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating the molecular and structural basis of BKIs impact on the growth of <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites in cell culture, this study provides essential fundamental evidence for potential clinical relevance of 1294 in the management of <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection. Although the <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest reversible effects on growth inhibition with the removal of drug pressure, the clinical outcome in a mouse model of infection indicates that five to ten days treatment results in an almost undetectable cerebral parasite burden with appropriate length of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Barely detectable number of parasites in the brains of mice from 1294-treated groups at least 2 weeks after the end of treatment, compared to the high levels of brain parasites in the control group, strengthens the argument that 1294 is efficacious <italic>in vivo</italic> despite not being parasiticidal in <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is consistent with recent observation of 1294 efficacy in the mouse cryptosporidiosis model <xref rid="pone.0092929-CastellanosGonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although we cannot prove there was no regrowth of <italic>N. caninum</italic> in the mouse model after 1294 dosing, the very low parasite counts over 2 weeks after dosing with 1294 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092929-g007">Figure 7</xref>) is good evidence that <italic>in vivo</italic> regrowth was minimal or immunologic containment was established after the end of dosing. The reduced numbers of <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites in the brains of treated mice is evidence that compound 1294 crosses the blood-brain barrier in sufficient concentration to be useful in clinical cases. Indeed, our unpublished studies have shown that 25 to 33% of the plasma levels of 1294 can be found in brain tissue of mice given a single dose of 1294. Favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of compound 1294 <xref rid="pone.0092929-Ojo3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> combined with an immunologic response, is likely to facilitate a more effective and complete clearance of parasites <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to the <italic>in vitro</italic> situation.</p><p>Overall, the prospect of a broad-spectrum anti-apicomplexan agent with no mammalian toxicity profile is quite exciting. Although further studies will be needed to fully elucidate the molecular target(s) of 1294, it seems that its role of inhibiting the host cell invasion and egress process is only one of its many functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cloning and Protein Production</title><p>A truncated coding region of <italic>cdpk1</italic> (NCLIV_011980) gene (nucleotide base 64&#x02212;1521) was amplified from <italic>N. caninum</italic> Liverpool strain cDNA using the primers <italic>LICNcCDPK1_G23Fwd</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- GGG TCC TGG TTC GGG GGC CGC CGG TGG AGC GGG AGA CAA GCT CCA TGC GAC G</named-content> -3&#x02032;) and <italic>LICNcCDPK1_Rv</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- CTT GTT CGT GCT GTT TAT TAG TTT CCG CAA AGC TTC AGG AGC ATT TGC TGA AAC -3&#x02032;</named-content>).
