The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (&#x0003c;15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems. To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research was supported by the Contrat Plan Etat Region 2007-2013 funding.

All surveillance systems analyzed showed a strong correlation with the ILI consultation rates declared by the Corsican <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network. Overall, the RIRs of consulting different medical services that participated in ILI surveillance (<italic>Sentinelles</italic> network, <italic>SOS M&#x000e9;decins</italic>, or OSCOUR) showed similar trends, which decreased with age. Similarly, virological data from the ILI patients enrolled from the GPs of the <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network confirmed this trend, as the rate of positivity for at least one respiratory virus decreased significantly with age. No clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak by the sentinel nursing homes.</p><p>Among the ILI patients enrolled by the <italic>Sentinelles</italic> GPs, 80.8% tested positive for at least one of the respiratory pathogens analyzed, which is a higher positivity rate than in previous reports <xref rid="pone.0100388-Nakoune1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0100388-Peci1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0100388-Huo1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This result could be explained by the high specificity of the ILI case definition used in the present study <xref rid="pone.0100388-Carrat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and the unusual length of the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak (13 weeks) <xref rid="pone.0100388-rseau1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study, coinfections were detected in persons aged 44 years and younger at a rate of 9.3%, consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0100388-Huo1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100388-Friesema1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100388-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Several studies have reported an association between viral coinfections and increased morbidity, but these remains controversial <xref rid="pone.0100388-Esper1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In our study, all coinfections were associated with mild ILI disease.</p><p>In the present study, the rate of positivity for at least one respiratory virus decreased significantly with age. It should be noted that while human respiratory syncytial virus (A/B), was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus after influenza in patients aged less than 15 years, in agreement with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0100388-Nair1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, HRV was the most frequently detected virus in patients aged &#x0003e;65 years. Information about the non influenza viral infections such as HRV to ILI episodes in older persons is poor, partly because of difficulties in diagnosis related to atypical presentations and low viral loads <xref rid="pone.0100388-Falsey1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0100388-Hershenson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

Overall, the RIR of consulting for an ILI was similar among the different surveillance networks analyzed here and decreased significantly with age. Two age groups were characterized by an RIR above 1: preschool and school-aged children less than 14 years old, and working adults aged 30&#x02013;44 years. This peak in the 30&#x02013;44-year-old group could be explained by their proximity to children as parents. This trend is in accordance with the viral etiology of the epidemic, characterized by the cocirculation of A(H1N1)pdm2009 and B influenza viruses <xref rid="pone.0100388-Turbelin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>In Corsica, no clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak in sentinel nursing homes. This was remarkable because of the significant cocirculation of influenza A and B viruses and of other respiratory viruses. This finding is likely attributable to the high VC against influenza viruses among residents, similar to the VC previously reported in French nursing homes <xref rid="pone.0100388-Vaux1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and a certain degree of cross-protection from previous exposure to influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 <xref rid="pone.0100388-Hancock1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It could also be due to the result of better general hygiene management, as demonstrated by the rarity of clusters of gastroenteritis (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) declared by the same sentinel nursing homes. However, it is unlikely to have arisen through a good VC among staff, as this was low (16%), similar to staff VC levels previously reported that ranged from 10% to 50% <xref rid="pone.0100388-Vaux1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>During the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak, epidemiological studies of laboratory-confirmed cases estimated a low-to-moderate vaccine effectiveness against influenza viruses <xref rid="pone.0100388-Guthmann1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0100388-Bragstad1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA gene in Corsica showed that all influenza B viruses belonged to the Yamagata lineage. Except for one strain that belonged to the group 3, all other Influenza B strains fell into genetic group 2 and were characterized by five mutations compared with the vaccine strain, located at four antigenic sites, which could suggest a drift <xref rid="pone.0100388-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The A(H1N1)pdm2009 viruses detected in Corsica belonged to groups 6 and 7, and showed a good match with the vaccine strain <xref rid="pone.0100388-ECDC2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

The monitoring of ILI, is mainly based on clinical surveillance, as the virological surveillance, for instance, was carried out by the <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network. The lack of virological confirmation for the patients of the emergency general practice network (<italic>SOS M&#x000e9;decins</italic>), who visited the hospital emergency departments (OSCOUR) and/or in nursing homes is an important gap. The evaluation of the causative agents of ILI in patients enrolled by the GPs of the <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network did not cover all possible respiratory pathogens, as other bacterial or viral pathogens that can cause ILI were not investigated. It is possible that a low viral titer could not be detected by RT-&#x02013;PCR. Moreover, antigenic characterization of the influenza viruses that were characterized genetically was not performed. Overall, the patients were enrolled using a rather specific ILI case definition (especially for the <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network and for the <italic>SOS M&#x000e9;decins</italic> network), excluding infected patients with atypical ILI symptom presentations, including older persons, as well as asymptomatic infections. Finally, the epidemic threshold was only available for the ILI consultation rates reported by the <italic>Sentinelles</italic> GPs at a national level, which may not be adequate at a regional level with respect to the GPs <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network and with respect to the other local surveillance systems.</p><p>To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented. Today, the Corsican <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network is the only network performing viral testing of ILIs in Corsica. This consortium will allow the integration of the virological surveillance of more than 20 respiratory viruses with the ILI clinical surveillance of the OSCOUR network (hospital emergency units), the <italic>SOS M&#x000e9;decins</italic> network (emergency network of GPs), and the surveillance of ARIs in the sentinel nursing homes. The integration of virological surveillance in these systems will permit the acquisition of essential information on the spread of the analyzed respiratory viruses in the island, especially influenza viruses, and about the severity of the influenza epidemics.</p><p>This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012&#x02013;2013 ILI outbreak and the influenza epidemic in Corsica using several surveillance systems. Overall, data collected from the different surveillance systems were well correlated, and they suggest that the influenza epidemic had a low impact on older persons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100388.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Amino acid substitutions observed in antigenic sites (A&#x02013;E) of the hemagglutinin protein of 19 A(H1N1)2009 influenza viruses isolated between November 2012 to April 2013 in Corsica Island, France.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100388.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100388.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Amino acid substitutions observed in antigenic sites (A&#x02013;E) of the hemagglutinin protein of 10 A(H3N2) influenza viruses isolated between November and April 2013 in Corsica Island, France.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100388.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100388.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Amino acid substitutions observed in antigenic sites (A&#x02013;E) of the hemagglutinin protein of 19 B influenza viruses isolated between November 2012 and April 2013 in Corsica Island, France.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100388.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the GPs of the Corsican <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network, the GPs of the <italic>SOS M&#x000e9;decin</italic> network the intensive care units and the emergency unit of <italic>OSCOUR</italic> network for their participation to ILI surveillance in Corsica.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0100388-Horm1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
