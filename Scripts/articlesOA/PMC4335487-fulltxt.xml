The CPR family is the largest family of cuticle proteins (CPs), which can be further divided into three subgroups based on the presence of one of the three presumptive chitin-binding sequence motifs denoted as Rebers-Riddiford (R&#x00026;R) consensus sequence motifs RR-1, RR-2 and RR-3. The TcCPR27 protein containing the RR-2 motif is one of the most abundant CPs present both in the horizontal laminae and in vertical pore canals in the procuticle of rigid cuticle found in the elytron of the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. Depletion of TcCPR27 by RNA interference (RNAi) causes both unorganized laminae and pore canals, resulting in malformation and weakening of the elytron. In this study, we investigated the function(s) of another CP, TcCPR4, which contains the RR-1 motif and is easily extractable from elytra after RNAi to deplete the level of TcCPR27. Transcript levels of the <italic>TcCPR4</italic> gene are dramatically increased in 3 d-old pupae when adult cuticle synthesis begins. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that TcCPR4 protein is present in the rigid cuticles of the dorsal elytron, ventral abdomen and leg but not in the flexible cuticles of the hindwing and dorsal abdomen of adult <italic>T. castaneum</italic>. Immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopic analyses revealed that TcCPR4 is predominantly localized in pore canals and regions around the apical plasma membrane protrusions into the procuticle of rigid adult cuticles. RNAi for <italic>TcCPR4</italic> resulted in an abnormal shape of the pore canals with amorphous pore canal fibers (PCFs) in their lumen. These results support the hypothesis that TcCPR4 is required for achieving proper morphology of the vertical pore canals and PCFs that contribute to the assembly of a cuticle that is both lightweight and rigid.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The insect cuticle is a remarkable biomaterial primarily formed from two different types of structural biopolymers, cuticular proteins and chitin. Despite a rather limited composition, insects produce diverse cuticles with the proper combination of mechanical properties such as strength, hardness and flexibility. Adult beetles are covered mostly by a hard cuticle, but they can fly because their cuticle is lightweight. The rigid cuticle is comprised of three major functional layers, namely the outermost envelope, the protein-rich epicuticle and the innermost chitin-protein rich procuticle. In addition, there are a large number of vertically oriented columnar structures denoted as pore canals that contain chitinous fibers (pore canal fibers) that are absent in soft and flexible cuticles. We have identified a cuticular structural protein, TcCPR4, which is predominantly localized in the pore canals of rigid cuticles of the red flour beetle. Loss of function of <italic>TcCPR4</italic> by RNA interference causes abnormal and amorphous pore canal fibers resulting in less organized pore canals that do not traverse the procuticle vertically. TcCPR4 plays a major role in determining the morphology of the vertical pore canals and pore canal fibers that contribute to the formation of a lightweight and rigid beetle cuticle.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2012R1A2A1A01006467).

It consists of three morphologically and functionally distinct layers, the outermost waterproof envelope, the protein-rich epicuticle and the innermost chitin/protein-rich procuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Structural cuticular proteins (CPs) and the matrix polysaccharide chitin are the primary components of the procuticle that consists of exo- and endocuticular layers. During cuticle maturation and tanning (sclerotization and pigmentation), some of the CPs are cross-linked by quinones or quinone methides produced by laccase 2-mediated oxidation of N-acylcatechols [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This vital process together with dehydration is important for insect development and growth because it produces the appropriate combination of mechanical and physical properties for different cuticles depending on the species and on specific regions of the insect anatomy even in the same animals [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The functions of individual insect CPs in determining the properties of the cuticle are not well understood. This study examines the role of a CP in <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (red flour beetle), TcCPR4, which is present in rigid adult cuticles.</p><p>Recent progress in completion and annotation of the genome sequences of several insect species has revealed that there is a large number of genes encoding CP-like proteins in insect genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Insect CPs are classified into several distinct families defined by the presence of specific amino acid sequence motifs [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The largest family is the CPR family, which includes proteins that contain a conserved amino acid sequence motif known as the Rebers &#x00026; Riddiford (R&#x00026;R) consensus sequence [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>When amino acid sequences of proteins belonging to the CPR family are aligned, they fall into three groups, RR-1, RR-2 and RR-3, based on sequence similarity [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and these groups tend to correlate with the type of cuticle (soft or hard) from which the proteins are derived. CPR proteins with the RR-1 motif have been found primarily in relatively soft and flexible cuticles, whereas many CPR proteins identified in rigid cuticles have a region of similarity called the extended RR-2 motif [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported the ultrastructure and morphology of rigid cuticle associated with the dorsal elytron, thoracic body wall and leg from pharate adults of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>castaneum</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Much like the larval body wall cuticle that is relatively soft and flexible in this species, elytral cuticle contains the envelope, epicuticle and procuticle that consists of numerous horizontally oriented chitin-protein laminae. However, unlike the larval body wall cuticle, there is a large number of vertical columnar structures in dorsal elytral cuticle, which extend directly from the apical plasma membrane protrusions of the underlying epidermal cells and penetrate the horizontal laminae, finally reaching the epicuticle. These vertical &#x0201c;pore canals&#x0201d; (PC) contain electron lucent fiber-like material denoted as &#x0201c;pore canal fibers&#x0201d; (PCF). Other regions of the body with rigid cuticle such as thoracic body wall and leg also have an ultrastructure very similar to that of the elytron. In contrast, there are fewer horizontal laminae and no vertical PCs with PCFs in the anatomical regions with soft, flexible and less pigmented cuticles such as the dorsal abdomen, ventral elytron and hindwing in mature adults of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>castaneum</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Apparently, this unique architecture and arrangement of numerous compact laminae and PCFs contribute to the formation of rigid cuticle.</p><p>TcCPR27 and TcCPR18 are two abundant cuticular proteins found in protein extracts of elytra from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>castaneum</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both of these proteins belong to the RR-2 group of the CPR family. They are abundant in rigid cuticle such as the dorsal elytron, pronotum and ventral abdomen but are absent or constitute very minor components of soft and flexible cuticle such as those found in the dorsal abdomen and hindwing of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>castaneum</italic>. Furthermore, TEM immunogold labeling indicated that TcCPR27 protein is localized in both horizontal laminae and vertical pore canals in the procuticle of rigid cuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) for <italic>TcCPR27</italic> resulted in an unorganized laminar architecture of the procuticle as well as abnormal and amorphous PCFs, which led to short, wrinkled and weakened elytra with the adults dying prematurely from dehydration approximately one week after eclosion [<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004963.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study we identified another <italic>Tribolium</italic> protein, TcCPR4, which is more easily extractable from the elytra of TcCPR27-deficient adults.

Although we have not elucidated how depletion of both TcCPR4 and TcCPR27 protein by RNAi leads to less severe elytral cuticle defects than that of ds<italic>TcCPR27</italic>-treated insects, it is possible that mislocalization of the TcCPR4 protein produced by RNAi for <italic>TcCPR27</italic> affects the expansion of the elytra, which occurs shortly after eclosion, resulting in shorter, wrinkled and warped elytra compared to those from the ds<italic>TcVer</italic>-treated control as well as ds<italic>TcCPR4/27</italic>-treated insects. An alternative hypothesis involves a geometrical consideration of the cuticle. Qiao et al.

In general, insects need to have rigidity or flexibility of the cuticle in all three dimensions. If one dimension is compromised without affecting the others, then the cuticle may become more flexible or stiff, allowing it to cope better or worse with the cuticle expansion process. This hypothesis may help to explain why TcCPR4 is not found in soft cuticles where there are few if any pore canals with PCFs in their core. Elytra from TcCPR4/27-deficient adults were significantly thinner than control elytra (mean &#x000b1; SE of ds<italic>TcVer</italic> and ds<italic>TcCPR4/27</italic> are 6.29 &#x000b1; 0.58 and 3.70 &#x000b1; 0.70 (&#x003bc;m), respectively. p-value = 5.1E-07) (<xref rid="pgen.1004963.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig.</xref>), softer and more fragile when handled with forceps in comparison to those of ds<italic>TcVer</italic> control insects.
