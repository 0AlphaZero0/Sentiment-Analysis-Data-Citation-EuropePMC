This study investigates the conservation of the genes <italic>AtTZF1-5</italic> at the level of their sequences and expression across plant species. The genomic sequences of the two <italic>RR-TZF</italic> genes <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> were isolated in durum wheat and assigned to chromosomes 3A and 3B, respectively. Sequence comparisons revealed that they encode proteins that are highly homologous to AtTZF1, AtTZF2, and AtTZF3. The expression profiles of these RR-TZF durum wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins support a common function in the regulation of seed germination and responses to abiotic stress. In particular, analysis of plants with attenuated and overexpressed AtTZF3 indicate that AtTZF3 is a negative regulator of seed germination under conditions of salt stress. Finally, comparative sequence analyses establish that the <italic>RR-TZF</italic> genes are encoded by lower plants, including the bryophyte <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and the alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. The regulation of the <italic>Physcomitrella AtTZF1-2-3-like</italic> genes by salt stress strongly suggests that a subgroup of the RR-TZF proteins has a function that has been conserved throughout evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RR-TZF</kwd><kwd>CCCH zinc finger proteins</kwd><kwd>abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>germination</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analysis</kwd><kwd>durum wheat</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministry for Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MIPAAF)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">NUTRIGEA and TERRAVITA Programmes</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Ministry for Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)</funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">AGROGEN</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Zinc-finger proteins constitute one of the largest and most diverse families of plant regulatory proteins, and increasing evidenc indicates that they act as key factors in several biological processes, such as morphogenesis and responses to environmental stress (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). These proteins are characterized by zinc-finger motifs that consist of cysteine and/or histidine residues that coordinate a zinc ion to form local peptide structures that are generally associated with specific molecular functions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). The CCCH zinc-finger motif, in particular, identifies a specific zinc-finger family, members of which have been found in many species from yeast to human (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Blackshear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2010</xref>). The gene family for these CCCH zinc-finger proteins has also been studied in plants, and various members have been identified by genome-wide analysis and have been implicated in a broad range of developmental and adaptive processes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xu, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A particular group of the plant CCCH protein family is characterized by an arginine-rich region that contains a CHCH motif (known as the RR region) that is linked to a tandem zinc-finger (TZF) domain, which is unique to plants (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pomeranz et al., 2010b</xref>). Members of the RR-TZF subfamily have been identified in several higher plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (AtTZF1-11) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xu, 2014</xref>). The functions of some of the RR-TZF <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins have been defined in relation to responses to a number of stress stimuli and developmental processes. PEI1 (AtTZF6) is involved in embryogenesis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Thomas, 1998</xref>), and AtTZF10 and AtTZF11 (which are also known as AtSZF2 and AtSZF1, respectively) have been described as positive regulators of salt tolerance (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). The overexpression of AtTZF2 and AtTZF3, which are two RR-TZF genes that are regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), conferred ABA hypersensitivity, reduced transpiration, enhanced drought tolerance, and delayed jasmonic-acid-induced senescence, whereas their attenuation showed reduced tolerance to salt stress (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Overexpression of another member of the RR-TZF subfamily, AtTZF1, resulted in late flowering and enhanced tolerance to cold and drought stress, while concurrent down-regulation of the AtTZF1-3 genes by RNA interference (RNAi) caused early germination and phenotypes that were relatively stress-sensitive (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). These studies have suggested a connection between AtTZF1 and ABA- and gibberellic-acid-mediated responses (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). The rice OsTZF1 gene is positively regulated by polyethylene glycol and ABA, and its overexpression in transgenic rice seedlings conferred hypersensitivity to ABA (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). OsTZF1 has been reported to be involved in seed germination, seedling growth, leaf senescence, and oxidative-stress tolerance (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jan et al., 2013</xref>). In transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, overexpression of TaZnFP, a <italic>T. aestivum</italic> gene that is induced by cold, salt, drought, and ABA, enhanced the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> drought and salt tolerance (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Min et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate a role for some of the RR-TZF proteins in ABA and gibberellic-acid pathway(s). Indeed, it has been established that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SOMNUS (AtTZF4/SOM) protein acts as a negative regulator of light-dependent seed germination, and <italic>som</italic>-mutants are characterized by reduced levels of ABA and elevated levels of gibberellic acid, which appears to be due to changes in the expression of the ABA and gibberellic-acid metabolic genes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). AtTZF4/SOM is positively regulated by the phytochrome-interacting factor-3-like 5 (PIL5) and ABA insensitive 3 (ABI3) transcription factors, which together bind to the AtTZF4/SOM promoter (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A putative <italic>RR-TZF</italic> gene was previously identified in durum wheat as a cold-responsive EST (EST002H8). Interestingly, the expression of this <italic>RR-TZF</italic> gene was also modulated by drought in a developmental- and genotype-dependent manner (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mastrangelo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">De Leonardis et al., 2007</xref>). To gain further insight into this putative <italic>RR-TZF</italic> gene and its regulation, we identified and characterized two homeologous genes, named <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> that correspond to EST002H8. Based on the sequence similarity, gene structure, and expression analysis, we established that <italic>AtTZF1, AtTZF2,</italic> and <italic>AtTZF3</italic> (indicated as <italic>AtTZF1-2-3</italic>) are putative orthologs of the durum wheat <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> genes. In addition, we showed that AtTZF3 is a negative factor in the control of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seed germination in the presence of salt. Finally, an evolutionary computational analysis indicated the presence of highly conserved AtTZF1-2-3-like proteins in phylogenetically distant species, such as the bryophyte <italic>Physcomitrella patens.</italic> Similar to the <italic>Arabidopsis AtTZF1-5</italic> and durum wheat <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> genes, the <italic>Physcomitrella TZF</italic> genes were shown to be regulated by salt stress. Taken together, our data suggest that the function of the AtTZF1-2-3-like proteins in the regulation of seed germination has emerged from their roles in pre-existing NaCl-stress signaling pathways that control growth and development in lower plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of Full-Length <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> Genomic and cDNA Sequences</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from durum wheat leaves of cv. &#x02018;Creso&#x02019; using the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-based method (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hoisington et al., 1994</xref>).

To better characterize the genomic regions encoding EST002H8, the full-length sequences of two genes were isolated in the durum wheat cv. &#x02018;Creso,&#x02019; which we named <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic>. The genomic and cDNA sequences are identical, which indicated that no introns are present in these genes. <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> are 1,630-bp and 1,633-bp long, and they contain open-reading frames of 1,155 and 1,164 bp, respectively. The coded proteins are 384 and 387 amino-acids long, with calculated molecular weights of 41.17 kDa and 41.45 kDa, and isoelectric points of 7.53 and 7.51. TdTZF1-A and TdTZF-1B sequences show 89.5 and 96.4% identity at the nucleotide and amino-acid levels, respectively. The region containing the two CCCH domains is highly conserved, but the Ser-315 (polar) coded for by <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> is replaced by the apolar Gly-319 coded for by <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic>. Moreover, the <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> gene is characterized by a nucleotide insertion coding for three amino acids (i.e., serine, cysteine, glycine) at position 254, with respect to <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> are putative homeologous genes, as a set of nulli-tetrasomic (i.e., N3AT3D, N3BT3D, N3DT3B) and deletion lines of bread wheat cv. &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; and gene-specific primers allowed us to map the <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> sequences to the bins 3AS2-0.23-0.46 and C-3BS1-0.33 on chromosomes 3A and 3B, respectively (Supplementary Materials; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).</p><p>Sequence comparisons of TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtTZF1-5 revealed that the wheat proteins are more similar to AtTZF1-2-3 than to AtTZF4-5 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Indeed, AtTZF1-2-3, TdTZF1-A, and TdTZF1-B have some amino-acid positions in common within or near the conserved RR-TZF region (e.g., Cys-95, Ala-109, Gly-111, Thr-141, Ala-142, Lys/Arg-153, Ala/Ser-157, Gln-177, Pro-178, Asp/Glu-197) that might discriminate the AtTZF1-2-3 group and TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B from the AtTZF4-5 group (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,D</xref></bold>). The gene structures (absence of introns) and the very high similarities of the TZF domains suggest that <italic>AtTZF1-2-3</italic>, <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic>, and <italic>TdTZF1</italic>-<italic>B</italic> are indeed orthologous genes. Moreover, there are some other motifs that are conserved in the grouping of AtTZF1-2-3, TdTZF1-A, and TdTZF1-B that are not in the AtTZF4-5 group (e.g., 60-LX[R/Q]YLP-65, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>; 381-[L/I]EEXPPMERVESGR-397, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref></bold>).

The completion of several high-quality plant-genome sequencing projects provided us with the unique opportunity to carry out a complete assessment and thorough comparative analysis of the plant RR-TZF proteins. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>, the entire RR-TZF region is very well conserved between the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and wheat RR-TZF proteins. However, the conservation is particularly high both in the region upstream of the CCCH domains and in the CCCH domains themselves. Therefore, to establish the evolutionary conservation of this gene family across the plant kingdom, we used the AtTZF3 sequence IDAYSCDHFRMYDFKVRRCARGRSHDWTECPYAH, which includes the CHCH motif and some upstream amino acids, as the query in BLASTP searches to find the most similar sequences from several plant species. The sequences obtained were filtered using the presence of both the CHCH motif and the TZF CCCH domains. Through this, we defined 461 RR-TZF sequences, including several in lower plants and algae. The few proteins that showed high similarity with the query sequence but that lacked one or more of the requirements (i.e., the CHCH motif or the CCCH domain) were collected separately (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref>). These proteins are likely to have diverse or compromised functionality and/or to be encoded by pseudogenes, and they were found in <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, P. patens, Capsella grandiflora, Amborella trichopoda, Glycine max, Zea mays, Malus domestica, Medicago truncatula</italic>, and <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>. The species analyzed and all of the sequences found are listed in Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>, where the proteins are named according to the TZF nomenclature, with the indication of the structure and sequence of the CCCH domains and CHCH motifs, and the presence and type of ANK repeats.</p><p>For the first CCCH domain, in addition to the proteins with the conventional C-X<sub>7-8</sub>-C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H structure, several proteins that showed a more variable structure were found (i.e., altered spacing between the first and second Cys) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). Several new sequences with a diverging CCCH domain were also identified in species in which the RR-TZF proteins have already been described, such as for <italic>Z. mays</italic>, <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, and <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (e.g., ZmTZF13, MtTZF6-14, SlyTZF9-12). In particular, ZmTZF13 contains 20 amino-acid residues between the first and the second Cys of the first CCCH domain. Although the amino-acid sequence C-X<sub>20</sub>-C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H would not be classified as a CCCH domain based on the definition by <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2008)</xref>, the high homology with the other RR-TZF proteins suggests that ZmTZF13 is indeed a member of the RR-TZF family. Therefore, the first CCCH domain might be better defined as the following more general structure: C-X<sub>5-20</sub>-C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H. The C-X<sub>9</sub>-C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H domains were found across proteins of several lineages, such as for monocotyledons (e.g., <italic>T. aestivum</italic>), dicotyledons (e.g., <italic>A. lyrata, Capsella rubella, Linum usitatissimum</italic>) and gymnosperms (e.g., <italic>P. abies</italic>, <italic>P. glauca</italic>) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). The C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H domains were found only in algal proteins (e.g., <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>), whereas the C-X<sub>10-20</sub>-C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H domains were exclusively found in monocotyledon proteins (e.g., <italic>Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Panicum hallii, Panicum virgatum, Sorghum bicolor, T. aestivum</italic>, <italic>Z. mays</italic>). The second CCCH domain, which was typically C-X<sub>5</sub>-C-X<sub>4</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H, is highly conserved in structure among all of the proteins, with the exception of two soybean (i.e., GmTZF17, GmTZF18) and two apple (i.e., MdTZF4, MdTZF16) proteins that are characterized by variant motifs (i.e., C-X<sub>4</sub>-C-X<sub>4</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H, C-X<sub>7</sub>-C-X<sub>4</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H, respectively).</p><p>Based on the sequence homology, we constructed a dendrogram that defined five distinct clusters of RR-TZF proteins (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3A</xref>). The largest group (i.e., RR-TZF I) corresponds to the proteins that are homologous to AtTZF7-11, and these are characterized by the presence of ANK repeats. The second group (i.e., RR-TZF II) contains the RR-TZF proteins that are highly homologous to AtTZF1-5; these proteins do not have ANK domains and they are relatively small (250 amino acids, on average). The third group (i.e., RR-TZF III) consists of proteins that are homologous to AtTZF6. Although these proteins are structurally similar to those of the AtTZF1-5 group, their amino-acid sequences are sufficiently different to form a separate group. Then the fourth group (i.e., RR-TZF IV) consists of proteins that are encoded by the gymnosperms and Solanum, and finally the fifth group (i.e., RR-TZF V) consists of proteins from monocotyledons (characterized by a larger spacing between the first and second Cys residues of the first CCCH domain) and algae. Interestingly, the multiple sequence alignments of the full-length RR-TZF proteins belonging to these five groups highlighted the presence of distinctive invariant residues in the RR-TZF region of all of the plant proteins (i.e., for monocotyledons, eudicotyledons, <italic>Selaginella</italic>, and <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, and even among the unicellular green algae). Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3B</xref> shows a schematic representation of the sequence conservation of the amino-acid residues, and the consensus sequence of the RR-TZF region. In addition, it is worth noting that the presence of several invariant amino-acid residues resulted in a signature that uniquely identifies the plant RR-TZF proteins (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Genes Orthologous to <italic>AtTZF1-3</italic>, <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic>, and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic></title><p>To search for the <italic>AtTZF1-3</italic>, <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic>, and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> orthologs, we performed a comparative analysis according to a sequence-homology-based approach (see Materials and Methods). Here, we identified only two subgroups: the first subgroup (i.e., RR-TZF IIa) includes 117 AtTZF1-2-3-like sequences, and the second subgroup (i.e., RR-TZF IIb) consists of 49 AtTZF4-5-like proteins (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>).</p><p>The AtTZF1-2-3-like proteins were found at all levels of the evolutionary scale, which included the green algae <italic>C. subellipsoidea C-169</italic> (CsTZF1), which thus suggested that their origin is very ancient. Moreover, even if their sequences show low similarity to the AtTZF1-2-3 proteins, some other RR-TZF proteins in green algae (e.g., CreTZF6, VcTZF6) might be orthologous to proteins of the RR-TZF IIa subgroup, as they share some specific amino-acid residues with them in the RR-TZF region (data not shown). The AtTZF4-5-like proteins were found only in angiosperm dicotyledon plants and in <italic>A. trichopoda</italic>, which is considered as the most primitive angiosperm, but not in monocotyledons. This indicates that their origin is more recent and that they are lineage-specific proteins.</p><p>To investigate the conservation and divergence of the RR-TZF IIa and RR-TZF IIb protein subgroups, we constructed relative multiple sequence alignments and carried out comparisons. Within the RR-TZF region, the same conserved amino-acid positions seen in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> were observed, which confirmed that these amino acids are specific for the respective groups and are evolutionarily conserved; the frequencies of the amino acids at each position are detailed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>. Among the conserved amino-acid residues, we focused our attention on the Cys (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>, blue diamond) at position -12 from the first Cys of the CHCH motif. Most of the RR-TZF IIa proteins (84%) have this additional Cys.

In the N-terminal region, there was the conservation of an IPP motif, which in the RR-TZF IIb proteins was followed by RKLL, and in the RR-TZF IIa proteins, by W. This W residue is present only in angiosperms, monocotyledons and dicotyledons, and not in other species (data not shown). In addition, the AtTZF1-2-3-like proteins contained another conserved short motif, RYLP, which is not found in the AtTZF4-5-like proteins. In the C-terminal region, the AtTZF1-2-3-like and AtTZF4-5-like proteins share some common motifs, such as SP-rich regions, and the sequence PDVGWVSELV/DPDLGWVNDLL, which is highly conserved. Finally, an EE&#x02014;PAMER-VESGRDLR motif is evolutionarily conserved in the RR-TZF IIa proteins (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>), while there is a CCLFC motif in the RR-TZF IIb proteins (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic Analysis of the RR-TZF Group II Proteins</title><p>To reveal the evolutionary relationships of the RR-TZF group II proteins, a neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on the alignment of the full-length amino-acid sequences of some selected plant species that are representative of each level of the evolutionary scale: <italic>A. thaliana, O. sativa, T. durum, Spirodela polyrhiza, A. trichopoda, P. abies, Selaginella moellendorffii, P. patens</italic>, and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic tree of the AtTZF1-2-3-4-5-like proteins from selected species.</bold> The unrooted tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method after alignment of the full-length amino-acid sequences using the Clustal W algorithm.

The other sequences can be divided into two groups, one that includes AtTZF4-5 and their <italic>A. trichopoda</italic> ortholog (AtrTZF4). As already indicated in the previous analysis, the AtTZF4-5 proteins appear not to have any orthologs in either monocotyledons or in non-angiosperm species, which indicates their recent origin and lineage specificity in dicotyledons. The presence of AtTZF4-5 in <italic>A. trichopoda</italic> suggests that this gene already existed in the ancestor of the angiosperms, but only in the dicotyledons has it been maintained, while in the monocotyledons it has been lost. The other group consists of 19 proteins, and it includes the AtTZF1-2-3 proteins and their relative orthologs that are present in all of the species analyzed, with the exception of algae. Moreover, clear separation is evident (which is statistically well supported) between the angiosperm and non-angiosperm (i.e., gymnosperm, bryophyte) proteins. Within the angiosperm group, the <italic>T. durum</italic> sequences are more similar to the <italic>O. sativa</italic> proteins, which is consistent with the evolutionary relationship between these species. Moreover, it is of note that despite it being a monocotyledon, the sequences of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> are closer to those of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as compared to other monocotyledons.

The other sequences (e.g., <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>, <italic>P. abies</italic>) are not distributed in a manner consistent with their phylogenetic relationships, which suggests that lycophytes and gymnosperms have undergone distinct and separate evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression Profiles of <italic>RR-TZF Physcomitrella</italic> Genes under Salt-Stress Conditions</title><p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>P. patens</italic> can survive severe dehydration, high salinity, low temperature, and high osmotic stress (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Saavedra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Charron and Quatrano, 2009</xref>).

In the present study, we characterized two durum wheat <italic>RR-TZF</italic> genes, <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic>, and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic>, which are highly homologous to <italic>AtTZF2</italic> and <italic>AtTZF3</italic>. Using a short conserved peptide sequence derived from the RR-region, we identified 461 putative RR-TZF plant proteins that share the unique signature of KX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>HX<sub>4</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>HX<sub>6</sub>RRX<sub>6</sub>YX<sub>4</sub>CX<sub>7-8</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>HX<sub>2</sub>FEX<sub>3</sub>HPX<sub>7</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>4</sub>CFFAH, which includes a highly conserved zinc-finger CCCH domain. Remarkably, <italic>RR-TZF</italic> genes were found in all levels of the evolutionary scale, including the green algae <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</italic>, indicating the evolutionary origin of these genes in a common ancestor of green algae and land plants. Based on our homology analysis, we also divided the RR-TFZ family of proteins into five different groups, as RR-TZF I-V, and TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B belong to the second of these groups, RR-TZF II.</p><sec><title>The RR-TZF II Group</title><p>The RR-TZF II group is formed by 168 proteins that are encoded by all of the plant genomes sequenced to date, with the only exception of some green algae. This suggests that the evolutionary origin of the RR-TZF II group is also very ancient, and is likely to have been before the divergence of the algae and the land plants. However, the homology analysis indicated that this group can be further divided in two subgroups: RR-TZF IIa and RR-TZF IIb. The first of these subgroups includes the AtTZF1-3-like proteins, and the second subgroup includes proteins that are homologous to AtTZF4/SOM and AtTZF5. Most of the RR-TZF IIa proteins (84%), including the TdTZF1-A, TdTZF1-B, AtTZF2-3, and <italic>P. patens</italic> proteins, have an additional Cys amino acid that is nine residues upstream of the invariant Lys of the RR-TZF signature (see <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). The conservation of this amino-acid residue suggests that it might have a specific role in protein folding and/or protein-protein interactions; e.g., through disulfide bonding. As an alternative, this additional Cys might be involved in the formation of an atypical CCCH domain, as C-X<sub>12</sub>-C-X<sub>10</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H, which partially overlaps with the CHCH motif, as suggested by <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2011)</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionarily Conserved Regulation for the RR-TZF IIa Proteins</title><p>We and others have shown that several genes belonging to the RR-TZF II group, which include the <italic>P. patens</italic> genes described here, respond to salt stress (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). The conservation of the gene expression response to salt stress suggests a function for the RR-TZF II proteins in assisting plants to cope with environmental stress, a common challenge to phylogenetically distant plant species. Interestingly, we observed very similar expression patterns for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (i.e., <italic>AtTZF2</italic>, <italic>AtTZF3</italic>) and durum wheat (i.e., <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic>, <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic>) genes during the germination process in the presence of NaCl. The conservation of salt-stress regulation during germination is intriguing considering the physiological diversity of the process across these two species, due to the different morpho-physiological features of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and durum wheat seeds. Remarkably, the attenuation and overexpression of <italic>AtTZF3</italic> in plants showed altered germination ability exclusively in the presence of NaCl and ABA, which thus suggests that the activity of the AtTZF3 protein is dependent on salt-induced stress and/or on the ABA levels. Previous studies have provided evidence for roles of the other <italic>Arabidopsis RR-TZF II</italic> genes in the germination process; however, in those cases, the germination appeared to correlate inversely to the level of expression of the selected genes. For instance, the concurrent suppression of <italic>AtTZF1-3</italic> by RNAi was characterized by early germination and relatively stress-sensitive phenotypes. Also, rice plants overexpressing <italic>OsTZF1</italic> showed delayed seed germination and growth delay at the seedling stage, whereas RNAi knock-down <italic>OsTZF1</italic> lines showed early seed germination and enhanced seedling growth (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jan et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, knock-out mutants of <italic>AtTZF4/SOM</italic>, <italic>AtTZF5</italic>, or <italic>AtTZF6</italic> showed early germination, whereas the plants overexpressing these genes showed late germination, compared to the wild-type (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bogamuwa and Jang, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A role for the RR-TZF II proteins in salt-stress responses might have arisen very early during plant evolution. Later, in higher plants, the RR-TZF II proteins might have acquired new regulatory functions that are connected to the germination process. However, ABA represents a common factor that links together salt stress and germination. ABA has an ancient origin and conserved functions in the life of plants, as it affects growth and differentiation, increases dehydration stress tolerance in bryophytes, and induces accumulation of soluble sugars (such as compatible solutes) in association with enhancement of freezing tolerance in <italic>P. patens</italic> protonemata (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nagao et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The core network that mediates ABA signaling is evolutionarily conserved between <italic>P. patens</italic> and angiosperms (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Takezawa et al., 2011</xref>), and the mechanisms of regulation of ABA-mediated salt-stress responses are very similar in <italic>P. patens</italic> and in seed plants (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Richardt et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Richardt et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrated that the <italic>P. patens</italic> homologs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes have key roles in the regulation of processes like flowering and seed development. In light of these data, our results suggest that the regulation of <italic>RR-TZF II</italic> gene expression during germination might have evolved from the pre-existing pathway(s) that regulate ABA-mediated responses to salt stress. This hypothesis is also supported by the conservation of certain regulatory elements that are linked to the responses to ABA and to abiotic stress, and that are located within the promoters of the <italic>AtTZF1-5</italic> genes and their homologs in durum wheat and <italic>P. patens</italic> (data not shown). As an example, the ABRERATCAL element, which is an ABA-responsive element (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Finkler et al., 2007</xref>), is present in the promoters of the <italic>AtTZF1-4</italic>, <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic>, and <italic>P. patens RR-TZF</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Expansion the RR-TZF II Genes in Dicotyledons</title><p>The level of sequence similarity and the physical position of the <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> genes on chromosomes 3A and 3B, respectively, suggest that these two genes are homologous in the durum wheat genome. As <italic>TdTZF1-A</italic> and <italic>TdTZF1-B</italic> are characterized by similar expression profiles, this strongly suggests a conserved function for these two genes in the diploid progenitors of durum wheat that was retained after the polyploidization event, probably because of their importance in stress responses and seed germination. A similar explanation can be proposed for the <italic>RR-TZF-IIa</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which have highly conserved expression profiles across duplicated genes. This is consistent with the &#x02018;functional buffering&#x02019; hypothesis that stipulates that genes with crucial functions tend to be retained to ensure that the essential functions can be carried out in the event of inactivation of one of the duplicates (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>RR-TZF-IIb</italic> group is lacking in monocots and non-angiosperm species, which indicates a recent origin and lineage specificity in dicot plants. However, the occurrence of one <italic>RR-TZF-IIb</italic> gene in <italic>A. trichopoda</italic>, which is considered to be the most primitive angiosperm plant, suggests that genes related to the <italic>RR-TZF-IIb</italic> group might have been lost during the evolution of monocot plants.</p><p>Among these <italic>RR-TZF-IIb</italic> genes there is <italic>AtTZF4</italic>/<italic>SOM</italic>, for which a role as a negative regulator of phytochrome-dependent seed germination has been established. Although <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> shares some dormancy pathway components with cereals (e.g., ABI3, VP1), there are also major differences in terms of the responses to light, as well as to other environmental cues (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Simpson, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Goggin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gubler et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, however, a model for temperate cereals, <italic>Brachipodium distachyon</italic>, shows phytochrome regulation of seed dormancy and germination (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Barrero et al., 2011</xref>), even though it lacks any of the <italic>RR-TZF-IIb</italic> genes.</p><p>Altogether, these data suggest that the expansion of the <italic>RR-TZF-II</italic> genes might have been related to the divergence between the monocot and dicot lineages, rather than to a specialized functional response to light stimuli. Among other possibilities, it appears reasonable to hypothesize that once the <italic>AtTZF4</italic> gene acquired phytochrome-mediated control, its product became a crucial factor in light-regulated germination, because of its intrinsic function as a negative regulator of this process, which is a feature that it shares with other members of the <italic>RR-TZF-II</italic> family.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study provides a complete survey and classification of the <italic>RR-TZF</italic> genes in plants for which the genomic information is available. This analysis has allowed us to compile a detailed description of the structural features of the RR-TZF motifs in relation to the evolution of this gene family. The strong conservation in terms of their sequence and structural features that is shown here across phylogenetically distant species, together with the similar expression profiles of the <italic>RR-TZF</italic> genes in response to salt stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, durum wheat, and the moss <italic>P. patens</italic>, have allowed us to hypothesize that these genes emerged as key regulators of stress responses very early during plant evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Roberto Bassi for providing the <italic>P. patens</italic> ecotype &#x02018;Gransden 2004&#x02019; and for hosting FD in his laboratory.
