To date, there is limited understanding of how starvation affects gene expression, particularly at the protein level. Here, we have used mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics to identify global changes in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> proteome due to acute starvation of young adult animals. Measuring changes in the abundance of over 5,000 proteins, we show that acute starvation rapidly alters the levels of hundreds of proteins, many involved in central metabolic pathways, highlighting key regulatory responses. Surprisingly, we also detect changes in the abundance of chromatin-associated proteins, including specific linker histones, histone variants, and histone posttranslational modifications associated with the epigenetic control of gene expression. To maximize community access to these data, they are presented in an online searchable database, the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.peptracker.com/epd/">http://www.peptracker.com/epd/</ext-link>).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The irregular availability of food provides a major challenge for organismal survival. Animals have to compromise between growth and survival in response to limited food sources. The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides an excellent model system to study the conserved regulatory circuits that link nutrient availability, starvation response, and longevity. In its natural environment <italic>C. elegans</italic> can experience conditions of both feast and famine (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Within the 3 to 4 day life cycle of the nematode, embryogenesis is supported by maternally provided nutrients and occurs in the absence of food. Larval development, however, requires feeding and progresses through four developmental stages (L1-L4). The effect of starvation varies at these different developmental stages. Hatching of L1 stage larvae in the absence of food leads to a starvation response without overt morphogenesis that allows for &#x0223c;2 weeks of survival (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Mid- and late-stage L4 larvae, upon starvation, develop into adults but preserve resources by reducing germ cell proliferation and thereby holding a limited number of embryos (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Conserved genetic pathways have been identified that link nutrient availability to metabolic remodeling, stress resistance pathways, and enhanced life span. Many of these pathways overlap and include TOR<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"/>, AMPK, autophagy, and insulin/IGF-1 signaling. PHA-4 is a FOXA transcription factor downstream of TOR kinase that is inactivated in the fed state (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Upon starvation, inhibition of TOR leads to de-repression of PHA-4 activity and the regulation of transcription important for starvation stress survival (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Insulin and insulin-like signaling also plays a role in starvation responses and converges on the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor, which in the absence of food activates stress resistance and related longevity pathways (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Other pathways, including the AMP kinases (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and AP1 (Jun/Fos)-dependent transcriptional control are also linked to metabolic remodeling and longevity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Also, DAF-16 and the nematode Rb homolog (LIN-35) globally affect transcription upon starvation at the L1 developmental stage (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, the effect of starvation on chromatin remodeling has not been examined previously.</p><p>Quantitative, proteome-wide changes in response to acute starvation have not previously been documented in detail in any organism. Using <italic>Drosophila,</italic> larval fat bodies were studied in response to amino acid starvation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another study analyzing &#x0223c;700 proteins reported changes occurring in the fly hemolymph, showing that yolk, storage, and fat body proteins are down-regulated in response to starvation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A study on rodents focused on &#x0223c;200 selected proteins involved in metabolism and insulin signaling that were extracted from mouse livers. This analysis of livers derived from mice that were fed on either a normal or high fat diet and both then compared in response to starvation revealed differences in protein levels that were dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strains analyzed (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>We have used the stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach for quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and improved on the efficiency of previous nematode SILAC studies (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The focus of this study is on changes in protein abundance, which is particularly important when the major regulatory mechanisms involved are unknown (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We have characterized specific sets of proteins whose abundance levels are either up- or down-regulated in response to starvation, thereby identifying metabolic and signaling pathways responding to starvation stress. Interestingly, we also detect specific histone variants and posttranslational modifications that are regulated in response to starvation.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>The EZQ protein assay and CBQCA assay were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).

After thawing at room temperature, &#x0223c;100 &#x003bc;l of 0.7 mm zirconia beads (Biospec) were added and the samples were bead-beaten (Biospec) for 2 min at maximum speed at room temperature. Chloroform (100 &#x003bc;l per tube) was then added and samples shaken by hand for 15 s prior to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. The 200 &#x003bc;l of the upper phase was moved to a snap-cap 1.5 ml tube, and 200 &#x003bc;l of 100% ethanol added and vortexed. This was cleaned using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) by applying the upper-phase ethanol mixture as the &#x0201c;sample&#x0201d; and following the manufacturer's instructions for subsequent steps.

From an average of over 45,000 unique peptides analyzed across the entire time course, more than 5,500 protein groups were quantified that were detected across all extracts from both the fed and starved nematodes and across all time points (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 1</ext-link> for protein-level data and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link> for peptide-level data; see methods). The classification of protein groups used here allows for the quantitative discrimination between related protein isoforms (for example, generated either by alternative splicing or representing closely related paralogues). On average, each protein group at each time point was defined by seven unique peptides. To ensure a high-quality dataset, we used a false discovery rate of less than 1% for both peptide and protein identification. In summary, this study identifies and quantifies the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome in-depth across the time course with high confidence.</p><p>To have an overview of the response of the proteome to starvation, histograms were generated showing the distribution across each time point of the log fold changes in protein abundance levels related to the number of proteins detected, represented by their density along the <italic>x</italic> axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). This shows that starvation leads to major changes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome, with both the number of proteins responding (either increasing or decreasing) and the degree of changes in abundance levels, progressively increasing over time post starvation onset until a plateau is reached at &#x0223c;8 h. We employed hierarchical clustering to characterize the changes in the proteome induced by starvation, using an inclusion threshold of at least a twofold change in abundance occurring in at least one time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, see methods). This identified &#x0003e;500 proteins that respond to starvation by either increasing or decreasing in abundance at some point during the time course.</p><p>Most proteins reached their maximum response within 16 h of starvation. Changes in abundance tended to occur progressively, albeit with the rate of change varying between different sets of proteins. For example, the abundance of the fatty acyl desaturase (FAT-2) was &#x0223c;16-fold down-regulated 8 h post onset of starvation and then remained relatively stable at this lower level for the remainder of the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). In contrast, the branched chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT-1) gradually declined in abundance over the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). Likewise, the fatty-acid-binding protein FAR-7 and the DUR-1 protein (dauer-associated protein), are both up-regulated. DUR-1 peaked in abundance within 8 h, while FAR-7 did not reach its maximum abundance until 16 h post starvation onset. In contrast, beta-tubulin (TBB-1) did not change in abundance throughout the time course of starvation.</p><p>A focused analysis of known PHA-4 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and DAF-16 targets (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), confirms that this study detects the expected regulation of these proteins in response to food deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>). Thus, the protein abundance of the HSP90-homologue ENPL-1 (PHA-4 regulated) and the protein of unknown function DOD-24 (DAF-16 regulated), were decreased in abundance after starvation. In contrast, the proteins superoxide dismutase 4 (SOD-4, DAF-16 regulated) and tropomyosin (LEV-11, PHA-4 regulated) were both increased in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>).</p><p>Based on the results of the time course experiment above, we chose to focus on the 16 h of starvation time point for a subsequent in depth analysis of changes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome that arise in response to starvation stress. This follow-on analysis used the same treatment conditions as per the 16 h starvation time point performed in the preceding time course experiment but now included three biological replicates and protein-level fractionation. We analyzed &#x0223c;45,000 unique peptides per biological replicate, yielding &#x0003e;5,200 protein groups that could be quantified in at least two out of the three replicates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 3</ext-link> for protein-level quantitative data and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 4</ext-link> for protein-level sequence coverage data and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link> for peptide-level data).

In addition, they are core components of membranes and serve signaling functions. As an example of the value of our dataset for evaluating the response of whole pathways, we provide a global overview of the response of lipid metabolism to starvation stress in terms of changes in the levels of enzymes involved in the control of lipid synthesis and breakdown and grouped by subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 3</ext-link>).

This enzyme utilizes acetyl-CoA to generate malonyl-CoA, which serves as an intermediate for the fatty acid synthase (FASN-1) responsible for stepwise assembly of fatty acids up to a length of 16 carbons. Our dataset indicates that the abundance of the POD-2 protein is down-regulated by &#x0223c;threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref><italic>B</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">supplemental Table 3</ext-link>). The fatty acid desaturases FAT-5, FAT1/2, FAT-4, and FAT-6/7, all of which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum, are all strongly decreased in abundance post-starvation; for example, FAT-6 levels are reduced up to &#x0223c;30 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref><italic>B</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 3</ext-link>). These data further show that other enzymes generally localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, including the ELO-2, HPO-8, and ART-1 elongases, which are all required for elongation of fatty acids, are also decreased in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">Supplemental Table 3</ext-link>).

The EPD provides convenient analysis and display of nematode protein data, with integrated links and data from Wormbase, Uniprot, and STRING for each protein. Each of these databases provides a unique resource for proteome-wide datasets and complements our protein level abundance data on the starvation response. Users can search for a protein of interest and immediately observe known interactions from STRING and basic functions associated with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>).

In addition, the graphs show data derived from a combination of protein isoforms, separately to isoform-specific quantitative data. For example, tropomyosin has numerous splice isoforms that have many overlapping protein regions. This makes the analysis of such proteins more complicated. The EPD displays the quantitative information for such proteins separately, with isoform-specific and multi-isoform data being shown as different colored lines for the time-course data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>) and different colored dots for the triplicate dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>).

This study represents the most detailed analysis to date of protein-level responses to starvation in any organism and also provides what is currently the deepest analysis of protein expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This analysis has revealed that starvation elicits a rapid change in protein abundance that remodels a substantial fraction of the proteome. This includes a wide range of biological processes and response mechanisms, including changes to chromatin-associated proteins. This reveals a potential mechanism for starvation to generate epigenetic effects on protein abundance and function.</p><p>The depth of our dataset provides an overview of the response within entire pathways such as lipid metabolism enzymes, which are critical to the starvation stress response. Collectively, these changes to lipid metabolism after starvation allow the organism to quickly shift from an anabolic to catabolic state, with a prioritization for mitochondrial ATP production through beta-oxidation of medium and long chain fatty acids. This dataset enables similar analyses for a plethora of pathways from metabolism to protein synthesis. To provide the community with convenient access to our data, we have deposited these data in an expanded version of the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics, a searchable Web-based resource designed for optimal presentation of high-throughput proteome-wide datasets. We have also deposited all of the RAW MS data files analyzed in this study into the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD001723.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Chromatin Response to Starvation</title><p>A striking observation in this study was that a number of chromatin-associated proteins, including linker histones, high mobility group proteins, and histone H3.3, rapidly increased in abundance after starvation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of acute starvation of a model organism regulating the abundance of chromatin-associated proteins. Interestingly, a recent proteome analysis of aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed that histone H3.3 (HIS-71) protein abundance was &#x0223c; threefold higher in old (5 days) <italic>versus</italic> young adult nematodes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Our own preliminary experiments indicate that the HIS-71 H3.3 variant is indeed important for survival following starvation and is also needed for nematodes to achieve a normal lifespan (data not shown). Together, these data indicate it will be important to analyze the role of HIS-71 and other chromatin-associated proteins in more detail in future studies.</p><p>Histone variants, unlike canonical histones that predominantly function to facilitate DNA-packaging, have roles in diverse processes, including chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and recombination and transcriptional silencing and activation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Alterations in these chromatin proteins have the potential to modulate chromatin structure and thus to affect transcription rates and cause large-scale changes in gene transcription across the genome. Our finding that acute starvation results in decreased acetylation of H4 at lysine residues K5 and K8, has profound implications for potential mechanisms that could allow food deprivation to elicit epigenetic changes in gene expression with possible long-term consequences. These histone acetylations have previously been associated with transcriptional activation and act as an epigenetic mark to allow for rapid transcriptional activation after mitosis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). A recent study showed that starvation stress can influence subsequent generations through a small RNA-mediated mechanism (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Our present findings suggest that the nematode may provide a useful model system to dissect mechanisms linking nutritional status with downstream epigenetic effects on gene expression and viability.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic Pathway Responses to Starvation</title><p>This analysis highlighted the dramatic abundance changes occurring to lipid metabolic enzymes after acute starvation stress. This showed the remodeling of these pathways to minimize energy expenditure and maximize energy production. Another aspect to this response is the need to minimize further stress to the animal, such as from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and infections. An interesting pathway that may be exploited by nematodes to achieve protection from ROS production is the up-regulation of the glyoxylate pathway after starvation. The glyoxylate pathway exists in plants, bacteria, fungi, and nematodes and converts acetyl-CoA to succinate (a substrate of complex II in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) via a by-pass of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, involving the multifunctional enzyme GEI-7/ICL-1. Use of this pathway yields less NADH (a substrate of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) per cycle. Complex II has been reported to function with less electron leakage and superoxide production when compared with complex I (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This may explain why we observed a marked increase in ICL-1 abundance after only 4 h of starvation stress. Because, at the expense of energy production, there is a survival advantage to reduce ROS levels. Intriguingly, ICL-1 protein has been shown to be up-regulated in insulin receptor (<italic>daf-2 null</italic>) mutant nematodes, and this up-regulation depends on the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16; also the longevity phenotype of <italic>daf-2</italic> null mutants is partially suppressed by ICL-1 depletion (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The up-regulation of ICL-1 protein we observe in this study may also contribute to the enhanced longevity of transiently starved nematodes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Few studies to date have used large-scale, quantitative protein measurements to analyze the acute starvation response. One previous report on caloric restriction (not acute starvation) of nematodes identified a number of proteins that change upon calorie reduction with limited proteome resolution (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The regulation of several proteins characterized in that study, where calorie restriction was conferred by the <italic>eat-2</italic> mutation, is in agreement with our present data. In addition, previous studies on the effect of starvation on proteins in mice and flies, albeit only encompassing analysis of either a small proportion of the proteome or else focused on specific pathways through targeted-MS approaches (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), overall are consistent with our data indicating that acute starvation inhibits fatty acid synthesis and increases beta-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. In contrast, previous studies that have measured mRNA abundance changes resulting from starvation in nematodes show many differences with respect to the reported effects of starvation stress on gene expression (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). These differences, which affect the conclusions as to how genes respond to starvation, were particularly evident, for example, in the response of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, for both acetyl-CoA carboxylase (POD-2) and the majority of the acyl-CoA desaturases (FAT genes), which are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, the reported changes in mRNA abundance levels was very different from our findings regarding changes in protein abundance poststarvation. Given our current data on the effect of starvation on the proteome, combined with the fact that proteins are likely to be both the major mediators and targets of most regulatory and signaling pathways involved in the response to starvation stress, we propose that it is important in future to focus on directly evaluating changes in protein abundance, PTMs, and other protein properties in preference to exclusively measuring mRNA levels.</p><p>In summary, this study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides the first comprehensive analysis of the starvation response at a proteome-wide level, documenting changes in both protein abundance levels and PTMs. The large-scale dataset described here provides a valuable resource for future studies, both in the nematode system and in other model organisms, including humans. It will be very interesting to determine which of the effects detected in nematodes are conserved in evolution, both in terms of the targets regulated by acute starvation and the signaling mechanisms involved in mediating these responses. We envision that with the continuing improvement of proteomics instrumentation and data analysis technologies, such as global analyses of proteome-level responses during development, aging, and in response to environmental stress will increasingly provide a valuable resource for biologists to understand the control of fundamental biological responses. Such studies can also be extended in future to include additional proteomic dimensions, such as the parallel analysis of changes in the subcellular localization of the proteome, changes in protein complexes, and more comprehensive analyses of a wide range of PTMs. An important future goal will be to ensure that such data provide maximum impact to the research community through the development of effective resources for open data sharing, as shown here with the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>Author contributions: M.L., E.P., and B.W. designed the research; M.L., E.P., and B.W. performed the research; A.B.M. and R.K. contributed new reagents or analytic tools; M.L. and E.P. analyzed data; and M.L., A.I.L., and A.G. wrote the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><p>* This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust (Grant Nos. 083524/Z/07/Z, 097945/B/11/Z, 073980/Z/03/Z, 08136/Z/03/Z, 0909444/Z/09/Z and 090944/Z/09/Z) and the Wellcome Trust grant 097045/B/11/Z provided infrastructure support.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><p><sup><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></sup> This article contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M114.044289/DC1">supplemental material Supplemental Tables 1 to 4 and Supplemental Figures S1 to S3</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="G1" fn-type="abbr"><p><sup>1</sup> The abbreviations used are:</p><p><def-list><def-item><term>TOR</term><def><p>Target of Rapamycin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMPK</term><def><p>5&#x02032; adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGF</term><def><p>Insulin Growth Factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHA</term><def><p>(belonging to) Pharynx</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FOXA</term><def><p>Forkhead box A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAF</term><def><p>Dauer Forming</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMP</term><def><p>5&#x02032; adenosine monophosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AP-1</term><def><p>Activator Protein-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NGM-N</term><def><p>Nematode Growth Medium, Nitrogen free</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPTG</term><def><p>Isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EZQ</term><def><p>Track name of a protein quantification kit produced by Life Technologies a brand under Thermo Fisher Scientific</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBQCA</term><def><p>Protein quantification kit produced by Life Technologies a brand under Thermo Fisher Scientific</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAW</term><def><p>Xcalibur Raw is a proprietary file format used by Thermo Fisher Scientific as an output for the data generated by the mass spectrometers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRIDE</term><def><p>Proteomics Identification Database</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GO</term><def><p>Gene Ontology: a database and web based resource to access a set of structured and controlled vocabularies for the community to use in annotating genes, gene products and sequences. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2238979/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2238979/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/">http://geneontology.org/</ext-link></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EASE</term><def><p>the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer is a customizable software application for rapid biological interpretation of gene lists that result from the analysis of microarray, proteomics, SAGE and other high-throughput genomic data. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC328459/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC328459/</ext-link></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STRING</term><def><p>Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins is a database and web interface of known and predicted protein-protein associations, integrated and transferred across organisms. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539959/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539959/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://string-db.org/">http://string-db.org/</ext-link></p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>We thank Grahame Hardie and Vikram Narayan for useful discussions and for commenting on the manuscript.
