FANCD2, a central factor of the FA pathway, is essential for the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) generated during fork collapse at ICLs. While lesions different from ICLs can also trigger fork collapse, the contribution of FANCD2 to the resolution of replication-coupled DSBs generated independently from ICLs is unknown. Intriguingly, FANCD2 is readily activated after UV irradiation, a DNA-damaging agent that generates predominantly intra-strand crosslinks but not ICLs. Hence, UV irradiation is an ideal tool to explore the contribution of FANCD2 to the DNA damage response triggered by DNA lesions other than ICL repair. Here we show that, in contrast to ICL-causing agents, UV radiation compromises cell survival independently from FANCD2. In agreement, FANCD2 depletion does not increase the amount of DSBs generated during the replication of UV-damaged DNA and is dispensable for UV-induced checkpoint activation. Remarkably however, FANCD2 protects UV-dependent, replication-coupled DSBs from aberrant processing by non-homologous end joining, preventing the accumulation of micronuclei and chromatid aberrations including non-homologous chromatid exchanges. Hence, while dispensable for cell survival, FANCD2 selectively safeguards chromosomal stability after UV-triggered replication stress.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Here we show that irradiation with low doses of UV light causes modest accumulation of replication-coupled double strand breaks (DSBs), i.e. collapsed forks. Remarkably, the Fanconi Anemia protein FANCD2 is central to prevent the aberrant processing of UV-triggered DSBs and the generation of micronuclei and chromosome fusions but is dispensable to modulate cell death. Specifically, FANCD2 promotes homologous recombination-dependent repair of UV-triggered DSBs, thus preventing their aberrant processing by non-homologous end joining. Hence, the homologous recombination-dependent tumor suppressor function of FANCD2 is not restricted to inter-strand crosslinks but instead extends to replication-coupled DSBs that arise from a broader range of genotoxic stimuli.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>VG, GS and JLB are researchers from the National Council of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET) and MDG and AR from the Nuclear Regulation Authority (ARN).

Initial signs of FA include bone or skeleton defects, renal dysfunction, short stature and very frequently abnormal hyper- and hypo-pigmentation of the skin and caf&#x000e9;_au_lait spots [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FA is characterized by bone marrow failure and high risk of developing myeloid leukemias and squamous cell carcinomas [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cells derived from FA patients are strikingly sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), i.e. cross-links between two DNA strands. Consequently, much of our current understanding of FA comes from studies that utilize ICL-causing agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane or cisplatin, as sources of DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, 17 genes with described mutations in patients were defined as components of the FA pathway that are all required for ICL repair [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>ICL removal is generally accomplished when the replication fork abuts the DNA lesion. ICL-stalled replication forks undergo a programmed collapse, which is regulated by all FA proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Firstly, FANCD2 is loaded onto the ICL, a process that requires the FA core complex, the D2 partner FANCI and D2 monoubiquitination [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, FANCD2-FANCI bind preferentially to a variety of branched DNA structures formed by ICL repair intermediates [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, the crystal structure of FANCI with DNA suggests that the ID2 complex could accommodate the X-shaped DNA structures formed by replication forks that collide with ICLs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Secondly, FANCD2 recruits the XESS nuclease complex (including the nucleases XPF-ERCC1 and SLX1 and the scaffold protein SLX4) and the FAN1 and SNM1A nucleases [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thirdly, these enzymes co-ordinately incise the DNA 3&#x000b4;and 5&#x000b4;of the lesion, thus unhooking the ICL. Finally, FANCD2 masters the resolution of such DNA repair intermediate by coordinating the activation of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), homologous recombination repair (HRR) and possibly Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Collectively, solid evidence demonstrates that FANCD2 is crucial to ICL repair.</p><p>Upon &#x003b3;IR, a source of replication-independent DSBs, ATM activates FANCD2 by phosphorylation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, FANCD2-deficient cells are only moderately sensitive to &#x003b3;IR and X-rays, another source of replication-independent DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, FANCD2 does not play a predominant role in the repair of DSBs generated by restriction enzymes, but it is key to the resolution of ICL-dependent replication-coupled DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These results led to the assumption that FANCD2 is specifically required for the resolution of all replication-coupled but not direct DSBs. However, it is yet unclear whether FANCD2 resolves DSBs generated at replication forks stalled by lesions others than ICLs.</p><p>It has been shown that the activation of FANCD2 during unperturbed S phase [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] suggests that FANCD2 participates in mechanisms unrelated to DSB repair. Indeed, FANCD2 prevents the nucleolytic degradation of nascent DNA triggered by hydroxyurea (HU) or aphidicolin (APH) and promotes fork restart immediately after drug removal [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hence, FANCD2 not only promotes DSB repair by HRR but also attenuates DSB formation by protecting persistently stalled replication forks and promoting their reactivation.</p><p>Intriguingly, FANCD2 is activated by UV irradiation, a DNA-damaging agent which rarely causes ICL accumulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with no persistent stalling of replication forks at doses of 20 J/m<sup>2</sup> or lower [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast to ICL repair, the removal of UV-induced lesions does not require coordination between TLS and NER as both processes can occur independently from each other in UV-treated cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, NER efficiency is not altered in FA-defective backgrounds [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Importantly, FANCD2-deficient cells show normal spontaneous and UV-C-induced point mutation frequency [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and null or very low sensitivity to UV-light [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is intriguing that the hypo/hyperpigmentation and the caf&#x000e9;_au_lait spots that characterize the FA disease are skin-associated defects. We thus reasoned that the function of FANCD2 after UV irradiation could be revealed by exploring processes that may not necessarily trigger cell death. We found that the UV irradiation of FANCD2-depleted cells with doses as low as 1.5 J/m<sup>2</sup> cause a striking increase of genomic instability markers, such as aberrant chromatid exchanges and micronuclei (MN) formation. The generation of both aberrations require DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While UV irradiation is not expected to directly cause DSBs, replication-associated one-ended DSBs (also known as double strand ends&#x02013;DSEs) could accumulate when elongating forks encounter UV lesions [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that FANCD2 does not majorly modulate DSB accumulation. On the contrary, FANCD2 guarantees the correct processing of replication-coupled DSBs after UV irradiation. In particular, FANCD2 promotes the recruitment of the HRR factor RAD51 to UV-damaged DNA and the resolution of replication-associated DSBs by HRR. When FANCD2 is depleted, unleashed non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) increases genomic instability after UV irradiation. Hence, FANCD2 operates beyond ICL processing, and such function might apply to all replication-coupled DSBs generated after different genotoxic insults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>FANCD2 preserves genomic stability after UV irradiation</title><p>As reported by others [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], UV irradiation induces focal organization (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>) and monoubiquitination (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>) of FANCD2, both in U2OS and PD20 cells expressing FANCD2 (PD20+D2). However, FANCD2 depletion (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) did not alter the cell cycle distribution after UV irradiation (whereas it did alter the cell cycle profile after MMC treatment, <xref rid="pgen.1005792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Moreover, both the transient depletion of FANCD2 in U2OS cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> higher panel) and the permanent loss of FANCD2 in PD20 cells obtained from patients (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> lower panel) did not affect cell survival both in short (2 days) and long (8&#x02013;10 days) term assays (however we observed hypersensitivity to MMC in FANCD2-depleted samples, <xref rid="pgen.1005792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C&#x02013;1D</xref>). To corroborate that the doses of UV radiation used can impact the clonogenic potential of U2OS cells, we depleted Pol &#x003b7; (to impair TLS). We observed that TLS-Pol &#x003b7;-depletion reduced the colony formation ability of UV-irradiated cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>), therefore demonstrating that UV hypersensitivity can be revealed in our settings. The undetectable contribution of FANCD2 to UV resistance is in agreement with four previous reports that found no effect of FANCD2 depletion on cell survival after UV irradiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and other manuscripts that showed similar results when depleting FA core proteins (see <xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005792.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005792.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>FANCD2 is activated but it is not required for cell survival after UV irradiation.</title><p>A) Western blot (W.B.) of FANCD2 (D2) in U2OS and PD20 cells expressing D2 (PD20+D2).

To evaluate this possibility, we first analyzed MN formation at the lowest dose required to achieve a detectable difference between untreated and UV-irradiated samples (5 J/m<sup>2</sup>). Strikingly, when depleting FANCD2, the frequency of MN increased in UV-irradiated U2OS (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) and in PD20 cells, when compared to control GM00637 fibroblasts or PD20 reconstituted counterparts, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). MN are formed when DSB are processed in a manner that excludes fragments of chromosomes from nuclei during/ after karyokinesis and before cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although not widely accepted, UV irradiation has been reported as a source of DSB formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We therefore inferred that the increase in MN in UV-treated FANCD2-depleted cells results from an increase in the number of DSBs and/or because of aberrant DSB processing. After UV irradiation, the most likely sources of DSBs are replication-coupled, one-ended double-strand ends generated at collapsed replication forks. The deficient resolution of replication-coupled DSBs increases replication-derived chromatid aberrations, which are specifically generated in S phase [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, we evaluated the role of FANCD2 on chromatid aberrations after UV irradiation. We first determined the lowest dose required to upregulate these aberrations in control samples (1.5 J/m<sup>2</sup>, <xref rid="pgen.1005792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). Interestingly, despite modest FANCD2 ubiquitination at low UV doses (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F Fig</xref>), chromatidic breaks/gaps were upregulated in such conditions when FANCD2 was depleted (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Moreover, aberrations such as chromatid exchanges (mono and poly-radial chromosomes), which have been exclusively associated to replication-coupled DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] robustly increased in FANCD2-depleted but not in control cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Importantly, only chromatid (generated in S/G2 phase) but not chromosome (generated in G1/G0) exchanges [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] accumulated in UV-irradiated FANCD2-depleted samples (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

To explore the first possibility, we first analyzed PCNA monoubiquitination and Pol &#x003b7; recruitment to replication factories, two hallmarks of UV-triggered TLS, a well-characterized mechanism that aids DNA replication across UV-triggered DNA lesions and could thus prevent UV-induced DSB formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

To further explore a potential modulation of TLS activity after FANCD2 knockdown we also evaluated the recruitment of TLS Pol &#x003b7; to replication factories, which is another parameter of TLS activation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

This is in agreement with the previously reported negligible contribution of FANCD2 to PCNA ubiquitination, Rev1 recruitment to replication factories and the unaltered TLS-dependent mutagenesis of UV-irradiated FANCD2-depleted samples [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Supporting the notion of a constant number of DSBs, we found that the activating phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX&#x02014;S139) [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] increased in a manner that depended on the UV dose but not on the levels of FANCD2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Moreover, when specifically focusing on the 5 J/m<sup>2</sup> dose, the intensity of the &#x003b3;H2AX signal modestly increased with respect to sham-irradiated controls with no significant changes after FANCD2 depletion (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

Collectively, these data suggest that FANCD2 depletion does not increase the levels of DSBs both before and after UV irradiation. To confirm this hypothesis, we set up a Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis to directly measure DSB formation.

Importantly, the prevention of MN accumulation after UV irradiation depended predominantly on FANCD2 ubiquitination as PD20 cells expressing the FANCD2 K561R mutant (PD20+D2 KR<sup>o</sup>) had MN levels similar to those in PD20 cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005792.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B and S7C Fig</xref>).

Remarkably however, we have unveiled a function of FANCD2 after UV irradiation. In particular, we show that FANCD2 preserves genomic stability by modulating the correct processing of DSBs generated during the replication of UV-damaged DNA. Whereas DSBs are not caused directly by UV irradiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], the accumulation of DSBs have been previously reported after 8&#x02013;10 J/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Indeed, we demonstrate herein that DSBs are formed at UV doses of &#x02264;5 J/m<sup>2</sup>. For example, UV doses as low as 1.5 J/m<sup>2</sup> induce SCE in control samples and complex aberrations (radials) in FANCD2-depleted samples. The formation of SCEs, aberrant chromatid exchanges and MN in binucleated cells require not only DSBs, but also DNA replication [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Therefore, UV-triggered DSBs are most likely generated as a consequence of DNA replication across damaged DNA. In fact, ATM phosphorylation after UV irradiation takes place predominantly in S phase [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, 53BP1 foci and MN in FANCD2-depleted cells accumulated almost exclusively in cells transiting S-phase at the time of UV irradiation (see <xref rid="pgen.1005792.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005792.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Figs). Thus, UV irradiation generates DSBs, most likely at collapsed replication forks. It should be noted that occasional ICLs, which depend on an alternative conformation of DNA that approximates pyrimidines from different strands, were also reported after UV irradiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In fact, when irradiating plasmidic DNA in vitro, a dose of 1000 J/m2 (260 nm) was required to accumulate ~0.07 ICLs/kbp [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While we cannot formally discard their contribution, it is unlikely that such a sporadic event could predominate over other types of fork collapses (at frequent UV lesions such as unrepaired cyclobutane pyrimide dimers and 6&#x02013;4 photoproducts). Moreover, FANCD2 differentially contributes to the replication of UV- and MMC-damaged DNA (see next section), thus reinforcing a difference in the fork-collapsing event after both treatments.</p><p>Despite their increased genomic instability, FANCD2-depleted cells did not show increased DSB levels. In fact, PFGE did not reveal substantial changes in the accumulation of DSB in FANCD2&#x02013;depleted samples. Consistently, KAP1 phosphorylation (a DSB marker) was not upregulated, and ATM and Chk1 phosphorylation were transiently downregulated. These results indicate that FANCD2 might process DNA repair intermediates at collapsed forks, generating substrates for ATM and Chk1 activation. Such speculation is supported by recent results indicating that after ICLs, DNA ends are resected into HRR-proficient substrates that promote robust ATM activation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. While we cannot further speculate on the signals leading to impaired ATM and Chk1 activation in UV-irradiated FANCD2-depleted samples, it is evident that in agreement with our PFGE results, the lack of upregulated phosphorylation of KAP1, ATM and Chk1 argues against a role of FANCD2 in the prevention of DSB accumulation after UV irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Differential contribution of FANCD2 to the replication of UV- and MMC-damaged DNA</title><p>Our results indicate that the main role of FANCD2 after UV irradiation is to direct DSBs into HRR repair (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005792.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005792.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This implies that FANCD2 may be crucial to the repair of replication-coupled DSBs that arise from sources other than ICLs. Indeed, our results suggest that the functions of FANCD2 in the cellular response to UV irradiation and ICL accumulation partially overlap. However, the responses are not equivalent. This conclusion is supported by the following observations: A) FANCD2 depletion does not trigger cell death after UV irradiation, which is strikingly different from the significant increase in cell death observed after MMC treatment in FANCD2-depleted cells. Moreover, while NHEJ deficiency either rescues or exacerbates cell death in FANCD2 deficient samples treated with ICL inducers [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], we revealed an insignificant effect of XRCC4 depletion in the survival of UV-irradiated FANCD2-depleted cells. B) NHEJ depletion abrogates all the chromatid aberrations caused by UV irradiation in FANCD2-depleted cells. While similar results were reported in other systems using MMC [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], the simultaneous elimination of FANCD2 and KU80 after MMC and cisplatin treatments in mammalian cells not only fails to abrogate, but instead further increases chromosomal instability [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Hence, while in response to UV- and ICL-damaged DNA FANCD2 facilitates HRR, the quality and/or quantity of DSBs may not be equivalent in both scenarios. In fact, HRR most likely takes place after the convergence of two opposite replication forks at the ICL [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the HRR substrate during ICL repair may resemble a canonical double-ended DSB, which could be repaired by NHEJ without causing a massive chromosomal rearrangement. In contrast, fork collapse induced by UV irradiation may generate DSEs which, in FANCD2-depleted backgrounds, may induce gross chromosomal rearrangements when processed by NHEJ. Alternatively, different nucleases may be recruited to DSBs after UV irradiation or ICLs. In this respect, it should be mentioned that FANCD2 not only recruits nucleases to ICLs but also to DNA lesions generated by HU [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While the nuclease in charge of the processing of UV-triggered DSBs remains unidentified, we postulate that FANCD2 mediates the processing of collapsed forks into HHR-proficient substrates. In fact, as mentioned before, defective Chk1 activation may indicate defective processing of DNA in the absence of FANCD2.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Chromosome protection by FANCD2</title><p>Since FA patients are not normally exposed to ICLs agents, a major concern of clinical relevance is to identify life-threatening sources of stress in FA patients. The group of K. Patel has elegantly shown that aldehydes are an endogenous source of ICLs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and that the enzyme Aldh2 is essential to prevent the accumulation of aldehyde-derived ICLs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Tissues with low levels of Aldh2, e.g. the hematopoietic linage, rely heavily on the FA pathway to process ICLs generated from endogenous aldehydes [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Hence, endogenous ICLs represent important triggers for oncogenesis in FA patients. But whether they represent the sole trigger for genomic instability in FA patients is still unresolved. While previous studies have proposed that the contribution of FANCD2 to the resolution of DSBs might be <italic>specifically</italic> linked to inter-strand ICLs [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], our report demonstrates that replication-coupled DSBs unrelated to ICLs may require FANCD2 for their repair through the HRR pathway.</p><p>In addition, unanticipated HRR-independent functions of FANCD2 have been recently identified. Pioneer work from K. Schlacher and M. Jasin showed that FANCD2 and BRCA2/FANCD1 prevent degradation of nascent DNA in HU-treated cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has also been shown that after HU, and in a core-independent manner, FANCD2 in concert with the Bloom helicase (BLM) restart stalled replication forks while suppressing origin firing [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In FANCD2 depleted samples, increased aberrant rearrangements of chromosomes were reported in [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and increased frequencies of MN where reported in [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the defects in chromosomal integrity observed after UV irradiation are the indirect consequence of DSB-independent functions of FANCD2 at replicating DNA after UV irradiation. However, a number of evidences disfavour such hypothesis. First, the DSBs-independent contribution of FANCD2 after HU has been associated with persistent fork stalling [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is not frequent event after UV irradiation doses used in this study [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Second, the chromosomal integrity of FANCD2-depleted cells after UV is restored when NHEJ is silenced, therefore suggesting that the main function of FANCD2 is related to the processing of DSBs rather than to DNA replication events taking place prior to DSB formation. Third, the events taking place prior to DSBs processing after HU are independent of FANCD2 ubiquitination [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] whereas the UV-triggered events, which take place after DSB formation, are dependent on FANCD2 ubiquitination (see <xref rid="pgen.1005792.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Moreover, it is also reasonable to speculate that after HU treatment, the accumulation of at least some aberrations in FANCD2-depleted cells, e.g. the non-homologous exchanges [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] require the elimination of the FANCD2-mediated facilitation of DSB resolution by HRR (in addition to the disruption of FANCD2 functions at nascent DNA). Hence, while it is conceivable that during the replication of UV-damaged DNA FANCD2 participates in more than one (HRR-dependent and independent) process, results in <xref rid="pgen.1005792.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> demonstrate that the inhibition of NHEJ is a function of FANCD2, which must obligatorily be disrupted to generate many -if not all- the chromosome aberrations observed after UV irradiation. Remarkably, uncontrolled NHEJ at replication-coupled DSBs might also be the source of the chromosomal abnormalities reported in FANCD2-depleted samples subjected to replication-stressing agents such as HPV 16 E6/E7 expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], HU/APH treatments [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], PARP inhibition [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], R-loop accumulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], and dysregulated Pol &#x003ba; recruitment to replication forks [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p><p>It is unclear to us why genomic stability but not cell survival is affected by FANCD2 depletion after UV irradiation. Similar results were reported after HU treatment [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is possible that the DSBs generated by UV irradiation and HU are infrequent and therefore only tangentially contribute to cell death. Alternatively, while unresolved DSBs could be extremely toxic, their resolution, even when aberrant (e.g. in a FANCD2 depleted sample), may suffice to prevent cell death. Indeed, our data reveals multiple backup mechanisms that promote resolution of DSBs. Hence, when forks collapse, resolution mechanisms that promote cell survival may prevail even when genomic stability is compromised with multiple rearrangements. Our results suggest that low levels of replication-associated DSBs may be an important oncogenic factor if FANCD2 is not available to direct them into an error free pathway. FANCD2 is also required for the spontaneous levels of SCEs in uveal melanoma [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], thus we speculate that even during unperturbed replication FANCD2 regulates the pathway choice for DSBs repair. We propose a surveillance role for FANCD2 that is required to resolve replication-associated DSBs arising from any stress source and which might be relevant for the etiology of cancer in FA patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Cell culture, transfection, and UV irradiation</title><p>The following cells were used: U2OS cells (ATCC), GM00637 (Coriell Repositories), FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells (GM16633&#x02014;Coriell Repositories) and two reconstituted counterparts, PD20 + D2 (GM16634&#x02014;Coriell Repositories, a microcell hybrid expressing low levels of wt FANCD2) and PD20 + D2<sup>O</sup> (PD20 cells expressing full-length FANCD2 cDNA), and PD20 K561R (overexpressed FANCD2 mutant with mutated K561 lysine).

A1) It has been extensively reported in the literature that the FA pathway coordinates the onset of TLS, NER and HRR at ICLs. A2) It has also been reported that TLS, NER and HRR are activated after UV irradiation, albeit in this case, these are independent (not coordinated) events. B) The role of FANCD2 activation after UV irradiation. B1) When UV-triggered DNA lesions are encountered by replication forks TLS aids DNA replication by tolerating the UV-lesion. Checkpoint signals also assists DNA elongation by preventing the collapse of replication forks and promoting the TLS-dependent bypass of DNA lesions [<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005792.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. B2) However, a fraction of the replication forks that encounter DNA lesions are permanently/irreversibly stalled; such structures may collapse creating one-ended DSBs. B3) FANCD2 (and possibly other components of the canonical FA pathway) promotes HRR at such collapsed forks. B4) The depletion of FANCD2 disfavours the HRR-mediated resolution of replication-associated DSBs after UV irradiation and promotes NHEJ activation, thus jeopardizing the integrity of chromosomes.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005792.s008.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Professors AR Lehmann (Universtiy of Sussex), J.
