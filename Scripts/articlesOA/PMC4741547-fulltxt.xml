We originally identified KIAA1199 (now officially called CEMIP) as a transcript highly induced in colon cancer: initially designating the transcript as Colon Cancer Secreted Protein 1. We molecularly characterized CEMIP expression both at the mRNA and protein level and found it is a secreted protein induced an average of 54-fold in colon cancer. Knockout of CEMIPreduced the ability of human colon cancer cells to form xenograft tumors in athymic mice. Tumors that did grow had increased deposition of hyaluronan, linking CEMIP participation in hyaluronan degradation to the modulation of tumor phenotype. We find CEMIP mRNA overexpression correlates with poorer patient survival. In stage III only (<italic>n</italic> = 31) or in combined stage II plus stage III colon cancer cases (<italic>n</italic> = 73), 5-year overall survival was significantly better (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, respectively) among patients with low CEMIP expressing tumors than those with high CEMIP expressing tumors. These results demonstrate that CEMIP directly facilitates colon tumor growth, and high CEMIP expression correlates with poor outcome in stage III and in stages II+III combined cohorts. We present CEMIP as a candidate prognostic marker for colon cancer and a potential therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>colon cancer</kwd><kwd>CEMIP</kwd><kwd>secreted protein</kwd><kwd>prognostic marker</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among adult Americans, with an estimated 136,800 new cases and 50,300 deaths in 2014 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. If detected early, patients with localized, resectable disease have a favorable prognosis with a 91% 5-year overall survival rate, yet survival rates decline significantly with disease progression [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Patients with metastatic disease to distant organs at the time of presentation have an expected 5-year overall survival rate of only 12% and a median survival time of 29 months [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite improved understanding of the molecular events leading to colon cancer, there is a continued need for prognostic markers that can predict disease progression, metastasis, or recurrence in patients with the disease. For example, patients with stage II colon cancer, in which overall survival is already &#x0223c;80% with surgery alone, the benefit of adjuvant therapy does not improve survival by more than 5%, thus underscoring the need for better prognostic markers to determine low from high risk stage II patients [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, elucidation of genes necessary for the metastatic process can lead to new avenues for targeted therapies.</p><p>Genes induced in colon cancer provide novel candidate biomarkers of tumor phenotype and aggressiveness. CEMIP, originally called KIAA1199/CCSP1, is one such gene that is highly upregulated in colon cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The role of CEMIP in colon cancer progression and mediating oncogenic growth is unclear, with studies implicating CEMIP as a target of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and as a promoter of glycogen breakdown and cellular survival [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, a study by Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that CEMIP can bind to the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), and is essential for the degradation of HA by human fibroblast cells [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HA is a large, linear molecule (&#x0003e;1000 kDa) made up of repeating disaccharide units and is abundantly expressed in most tissues, including the colon [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Degradation of HA to low molecular weight fragments can stimulate angiogenesis, promote cell migration, and play an important role in cancer progression and inflammation [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], thus suggesting a possible functional role for the upregulation of CEMIP in the progression of colon cancer.</p><p>In this study, we comprehensively characterize CEMIP expression in colon cancer and investigate its role in colon cancer progression and as an indicator of poor clinical outcome. We identify CEMIP as a secreted protein that is induced as early as the colon adenoma stage, whose overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome in colon cancer patients, and has a potential role in promoting tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title><italic>CEMIP/KIAA1199</italic> expression is induced in colon neoplasia</title><p>To identify novel markers of colon neoplasia, we used GeneChip gene expression microarrays to compare genomewide patterns of gene expression in colon tumors <italic>versus</italic> normal colon epithelium[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, while only two normal colon mucosal samples showed any expression of CEMIP above the microarray measurement threshold of 25, median expression of CEMIP reached 451 in colon cancer cell lines, and 330 in primary colon tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). High levels of CEMIP were detected in early node-negative stage II colon cancers (median value 226), and in colon adenomas (1 tubular, 2 tubulovillous and 6 villous all &#x0003e; 1 cm in size, median value 264) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CEMIP mRNA expression in normal colon epithelium and colon cancer samples</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Expression levels of CEMIP measured on GeneChip microarrays for samples of normal colon epithelium, colon adenomas, colon cancer primary tumors of stages II, III and IV, colon cancer hepatic metastases, and colon cancer cell lines.

Using, RT-PCR we connected CEMIP to additional multiple ESTs that mapped to the 15q24-25 genomic region, finding expression in colon cancers of a 4083 bp full-length coding transcript that covers 30 exons and encodes a protein of 1361 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A &#x00026; S1C</xref>).

Both transcripts have an in-frame TAG (7.0 kb form) or TGA (7.2 kb form) stop codon 5&#x02032; to the same ATG start codon.

In further analysis of primary colorectal tumors, 13 of 15 colon cancers demonstrated easily detectable CEMIP expression; whereas, no signal was detected in any of the 15 matched normal colon mucosa samples, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Real-time PCR analysis of a second independent set of 29 colon cancer cases further confirmed CEMIP induction in colon cancers.

CEMIP mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR of colon cancer tumors obtained from 31 stage III colon cancer patients with microsatellite stable cancers and for whom long term clinical follow-up was available. Colon cancer cases were divided into those with CEMIP expression above the median (CEMIP high), and those with CEMIP expression below the median (CEMIP low) (median CEMIP = 1.024). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for colon cancer specific death showed that CEMIP low cases (<italic>n</italic> = 15) had notably favorable outcomes, with median survival of greater than 140 months. In contrast, CEMIP high cases (<italic>n</italic> = 16) demonstrated markedly worse outcomes, with median survival of only 37 months, a reduction of 8.6 years (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Multivariable Cox regression survival modeling adjusting for age at diagnosis, gender, and race showed that those with CEMIP expression values greater than or equal to the median had 4.93 fold increased risk of death as compared to those with values below the median (HR = 4.93, 95% CI = (1.50,16.14)). Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression survival models for all deaths showed similar results (data not shown).</p><p>The adverse outcome associated with high CEMIP tumor expression was also evident in an analysis that combined the 31 stage III colon cancer cases with an additional 42 stage II colon cancer cases that were also microsatellite stable and had available long term follow-up.

A 17 bp deletion was introduced into both copies of <italic>CEMIP</italic> exon 2 that contains the start ATG and signal peptide sequence. This 17 bp deletion of exon 2 (plus 2 bp of the immediately following intron) results in only the first 25 amino acids of CEMIP being properly translated, with the remainder (1336 aa) being out of frame (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Two independent DLD-1 clones were obtained in which both alleles of <italic>CEMIP</italic> were knocked out as determined by genotyping assays, and in which no CEMIP protein was detected by Western analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

Because remodeling of the extracellular matrix is crucial for aspects of tumor biology including tumor expansion, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we tested if CEMIP mediated this function in colon cancers by histochemical staining for HA in the aggressive xenografts formed by CEMIP wild-type DLD1 colon cancer cells <italic>versus</italic> the impeded xenografts formed by CEMIP knockout cells.

We originally identified KIAA1199 as a novel transcript highly induced in colon cancer and deposited the full-length transcript and 5&#x02032; UTR variants as GenBank accession numbers AY581148, AY585237, and AY581149, under the name Colon Cancer Secreted Protein 1 (<italic>CCSP1</italic>) before the gene name was officially changed to <italic>CEMIP</italic>. We found that CEMIP is markedly upregulated in colon cancer both at the mRNA and protein level, with induction occurring as early as the colon adenoma stage, and encodes a secreted protein (U.S. patent #7,118,912) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similar to ours and others [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] findings in colon cancer, a search of the Oncomine [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] database identifies microarray studies demonstrating upregulation of CEMIP in several other epithelial cancers, including breast [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], gastric [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These data suggest that induction of CEMIP expression in neoplasia may be a general feature of many solid tumors. We found no evidence of amplification of <italic>CEMIP</italic> or for rearrangement of the gene promoter as possible explanations for CEMIP overexpression in colon cancer. Similarly, CEMIP was not found to be a target for amplification in the TCGA dataset [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Findings by Sabates-Bellver <italic>et al</italic>., suggests that CEMIP overexpression in colon tumors may be due to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, consequent to mutations in either APC or beta-catenin [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This observation is consistent with our findings that induction of CEMIP is common in colon cancers and occurs as early as the colon adenoma stage.</p><p>Important to this study is our finding that elevated CEMIP expression in human colon tumors is associated with markedly reduced survival in stage III colon cancer cases. Individuals whose stage III colon cancer tumors express CEMIP below the median lived an average &#x0003e; 8.6 years longer than stage III colon cancer cases whose tumor CEMIP levels were above the median, a dramatic difference in patient survival. Multivariable Cox regression analysis including age at diagnosis, gender, and race demonstrated that CEMIP expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Elevated tumor CEMIP expression showed an even more statistically significant association with reduced survival in an expanded set of individuals having either stage II or stage III colon cancers. Our finding of high tumor CEMIP expression associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer is supported by findings of a 50% decrease in 5-year survival of gastric cancer patients whose tumors expressed high <italic>versus</italic> low CEMIP [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] as well as a survey of breast cancer DNA microarray datasets finding reduced survival in patients with tumors expressing high <italic>versus</italic> low CEMIP [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, the association of CEMIP expression with poor prognosis in colon cancer was found in a different context by Birkenkamp-Demtroder <italic>et al</italic>. based on immunohistochemical studies in which a slightly better prognosis was reported for subgroup of stage II patients with strong nuclear, yet weak cytoplasmic, staining for CEMIP compared to cases with strong cytoplasmic, or nuclear and cytoplasmic staining [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Our findings of a marked difference in survival between individuals whose colon tumors have high <italic>versus</italic> low CEMIP in our patient cohort will clearly merit testing in follow-up studies of larger cohorts of stage III and of stage II plus III colon cancer cases, as well as in cohorts of sufficient size to detect possible effects of CEMIP expression on outcome of stage II only colon cancer cases.</p><p>Our finding that knocking out CEMIP markedly attenuates xenograft growth provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrating a critical role for CEMIP expression in colon cancer tumor growth, thus suggesting that CEMIP directly contributes to tumor phenotype and may itself be a therapeutic target. In testing for CEMIP somatic mutations, we identified only one mutation among 13 colon cancer cell lines, a homozygous Gly1173Asp alteration present in a single sample. Likewise, TCGA data finds CEMIP mutated in only 8 of 212 cases, with none of the mutations predicted to have a significant deleterious impact on function [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, the contribution of CEMIP to tumor phenotype appears to generally be mediated by the native protein. Facilitation of tumor growth by CEMIP overexpression may be due, in part, by protecting cells from apoptosis; as deletion of CEMIP resulted in increased cleaved caspase-3 staining in CEMIP knockout DLD-1 xenografts with significantly attenuated growth. Our findings are supported by studies in other cancers demonstrating CEMIP can protect cervical [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], gastric [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and breast [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] cancer cells from apoptosis, though the exact molecular mechanism of CEMIP's anti-apoptotic effect has yet to be elucidated. Additionally, our demonstration that CEMIP knockout results in markedly increased intratumoral levels of HA suggests an important role for CEMIP overexpression in the degradation of HA in the extracellular matrix. These findings are consistent with the biochemical studies of Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrating CEMIP as a hyaladherin involved in HA depolymerization [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. High molecular weight HA plays an important role in a variety of functions involved in maintaining tissue integrity and homeostasis while low molecular weight fragments from the degradation of HA are potent promoters of a variety of functions important to tumor progression, and have been detected in a variety of cancer types [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Of note, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that addition of HA tetrasaccharides to cultured cell lines can induce heat shock proteins and suppress apoptosis [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], potentially linking CEMIP's anti-apoptotic activity with its role in HA depolymerization. Our finding of an inverse association between CEMIP levels and HA deposition suggests a model in which CEMIP overexpression contributes to colon cancer phenotype both by removing a HA physical barrier as well as by increasing production of tumor promoting low molecular weight HA fragments. Furthermore, it suggests that CEMIP overexpression may be a novel target for therapy as studies in which tumor HA turnover is disrupted demonstrate tumor growth inhibition both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, our findings that CEMIP is not only a prognostic marker of outcome in colon cancer, but also directly contributes to maintenance of tumor phenotype, should spur further investigations to determine the potential of CEMIP as a therapeutic target, and to elucidate its biological function in HA metabolism when overexpressed in human cancers. Future studies are currently planned to elucidate the mechanism of CEMIP expression on protection from apoptosis. Finally, the finding that CEMIP is a secreted protein whose expression is dramatically upregulated in colon adenomas and early colon cancers nominates this protein as a highly interesting candidate serological marker of early human colon neoplasia, for which future studies will certainly be warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Sequences</title><p>Human CEMIP mRNA and gene sequence GenBank accession numbers as deposited by our group under the name Colon Cancer Secreted Protein 1 (<italic>CCSP1</italic>) are AY581148, AY585237, and AY581149.</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>VACO cell lines were established in the investigators laboratories according to previously described methods [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Antigen retrieval was performed for 30 s at 123&#x000b0;C in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using a pressure cooker followed by a cool-down period of 20 min. Reduction of peroxidases was accomplished by incubating for 8 min in Peroxidazed 1 (BioCare Medical, Concord, CA). Slides were sequentially blocked in Avidin-Biotin Blocking Kit (BioCare Medical), Background Sniper (BioCare Medical) and Rodent Block M (BioCare Medical) for 15 min, respectively. Biotinylated Hyaluronic Acid Binding Protein (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was added at a 1:800 dilution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 10 min incubation with 4+ Streptavidin HRP Label (BioCare Medical). Staining was performed with Betazoid DABKit (BioCare Medical) for 5 min followed by counterstaining with CAT Hematoxylin (BioCare Medical) for 1 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4_16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in gene expression levels by stage of colon cancer and differences in tumor size by CEMIP expression status were assessed using t-tests with two-sided p-values.
