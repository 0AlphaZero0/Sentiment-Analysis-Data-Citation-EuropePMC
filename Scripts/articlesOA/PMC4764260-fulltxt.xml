Here, we integrated DNaseI footprinting data with sequence-based transcription factor (TF) motif models to predict the impact of a genetic variant on TF binding across 153 tissues and 1,372 TF motifs. Each annotation we derived is specific for a cell-type condition or assay and is locally motif-driven. We found 5.8 million genetic variants in footprints, 66% of which are predicted by our model to affect TF binding. Comprehensive examination using allele-specific hypersensitivity (ASH) reveals that only the latter group consistently shows evidence for ASH (3,217 SNPs at 20% FDR), suggesting that most (97%) genetic variants in footprinted regulatory regions are indeed silent. Combining this information with GWAS data reveals that our annotation helps in computationally fine-mapping 86 SNPs in GWAS hit regions with at least a 2-fold increase in the posterior odds of picking the causal SNP. The rich meta information provided by the tissue-specificity and the identity of the putative TF binding site being affected also helps in identifying the underlying mechanism supporting the association. As an example, the enrichment for LDL level-associated SNPs is 9.1-fold higher among SNPs predicted to affect HNF4 binding sites than in a background model already including tissue-specific annotation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A large fraction of genetic variants that have been associated with complex traits are found outside of protein coding genes and likely affect gene regulation. Many experimental efforts have been dedicated to mapping regulatory regions in the genome but there are not many systematic methods that integrate functional data and regulatory sequences to predict the potential effect of any genetic variant on any given tissue and motif. Here we present a tissue and factor specific annotation that provides a predicted functional effect for both common and rare genetic variants. These predictions, certain of which are validated experimentally, show that the majority of genetic variants in gene regulatory regions are actually silent. Annotating those that are not silent allows us to investigate the molecular basis for the genetic architecture of many common traits and also to study the evolutionary properties that different types of regulatory sequences have across tissues or transcription factors. Overall, our study supports the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites for distinct classes of transcription factors has been a major target of evolutionary forces contributing to disease risk and complex trait variation in humans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>) grant 1R01GM109215-01 to RPR and FL and by the American Heart Association (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heart.org/">http://www.heart.org/</ext-link>) grant AHA14SDG20450118 to FL.

For example, large numbers of genetic variants associated with disease and normal trait variation have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; yet a formidable challenge remains in determining the specific molecular mechanisms underlying association signals in non-coding regions. Similar challenges also arise when exploring the evolutionary functional significance of non-coding variants, for example through analysis of differences in genotype distribution across populations [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is also complicated by the fact that GWAS hits and signals of selection are usually found in large regions of association and do not directly pinpoint the true causative variants. In general, we do not know in which cell types/tissues these variants may have a functional impact.</p><p>Computationally and experimentally derived annotations for regulatory regions have been used to functionally characterize GWAS hits [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, a simple positional overlap between a genetic variant and regulatory regions is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to demonstrate an impact on TF binding. Many experimentally derived annotations are very useful to identify broad genomic regions across many cell-types, but lack the resolution necessary to pinpoint the regulatory sequences. High resolution functional assays like DNase-seq and ATAC-seq combined with computational methods that integrate sequence motif models [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] can effectively dissect the regulatory elements; yet the motif models for transcription factor (TF) binding are generally not sufficiently well calibrated to predict the binding impact of a sequence change. Alternative ChIP based approaches (such as ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo), may provide increased TF and regulatory element specificity, but rely upon the availability of antibodies to target specific TFs or tagged TFs [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The consequence is that we cannot provide a satisfactory answer to the following questions: Which genetic variants are more likely to impact binding of specific TFs? What is the fraction of genetic variants in regulatory regions that are not neutral? If we can adequately answer these questions, we may further ask: Did polygenic adaptation occur at binding sites for the same TF? Do variants in certain types of TF footprints and tissues contribute to variation in specific complex traits?</p><p>To help answer these questions, we have extended the CENTIPEDE approach to generate a catalog of regulatory sites and binding variants encompassing more than 600 experimental samples from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects with DNase-seq data, and recalibrated sequence motif models for more than 800 TFs. We then incorporated ASH information to provide additional empirical evidence, to validate the accuracy of the computational predictions and to estimate the fraction of genetic variants in regulatory regions that are not neutral. Importantly, our annotation is specific at the motif level (i.e., TF-specific) and at the sample level (i.e., tissue-specific). We then compare our results with the only alternative TF-centric annotation that has been recently published [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but we also compare with non TF-centric SVM derived annotations [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Using our new catalog, we then examined genomic properties of the annotations, identifying characteristics that predict variants that disrupt binding, and demonstrated the action of natural selection on TF binding sites. Finally, we annotated and interpreted variants associated with complex traits, and we validated their allele-specific enhancer activity by reporter gene assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Computational prediction of functional variants in regulatory sequences</title><p>The CENTIPEDE approach allows to predict TF activity by integrating sequence motif models together with functional genomics data, and gains the most information from high-resolution data such as DNase-seq or ATAC-seq [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The spatial pattern in which reads are distributed, or footprint, is specific for each TF and can be very useful for discriminating between classes of TFs with distinct profiles [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the original CENTIPEDE approach, the sequence models are pre-determined; e.g, k-mers or previously defined position weight matrix (PWM) models. However, many sequence models in existing databases were created with very few instances of known TF binding sites and do not represent the full spectrum of sequence variation that can be tolerated without affecting binding. Here, we have extended CENTIPEDE to readjust the sequence models for TF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005875.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s022">S1 Fig</xref>) using DNase-seq data and sequence orthologs (Methods). Compared to the original motif models the consensus sequence is largely maintained in the recalibrated motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s027">S6 Fig</xref>).

Each individual sample contained, on average, 280,000 non-overlapping footprints for 600 motifs and spanning 0.162% of the genome, indicating that footprints are highly tissue specific. Considering all SNPs from 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) at any allele frequency (even singletons), we found 5,810,227 (0.19% of the genome) unique genetic variants in active footprints (footprint-SNPs), 3,831,862 (66%) of which are predicted to alter the prior odds of binding &#x02265;20-fold (effect-SNPs) based on the logistic sequence model hyperprior in the CENTIPEDE model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005875.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, Equation 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Effect-SNPs are further classified as switch-SNPs (264,965) if the allele flips the prior odds of binding.

To experimentally assess the accuracy of our answer, we used Quantitative Allele-Specific Analysis of Reads (QuASAR) [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to perform joint genotyping and ASH analysis within DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s023">S2 Fig</xref>). While the initial quality filtering is the same as for the CENTIPEDE analysis, the parameters of the QuASAR model also allowed us to detect tissues with chromosomal abnormalities or samples from pooled individuals (Section 4.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s001">S1 Text</xref>). These DNase-I samples were therefore excluded from ASH analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s030">S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s031">S10</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s011">S6 Table</xref>). Across the remaining 316 samples suitable for ASH analysis, we identified 204,757 heterozygous SNPs (hSNPs) in DHS sites (DHS-hSNPs) with coverage &#x0003e; 10x and with MAF &#x0003e; 0.05.</p><p>Overlapping our predictions with the DHS-hSNPs, 55,044 are footprint-hSNPs, 26,773 of these are effect-hSNPs, and 5,991 of these are switch-hSNPs. Overall, our computational predictions are highly concordant with the direction of ASH; 75% of the sequence models show positive correlation between the predicted and observed ASH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s032">S11 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s012">S7 Table</xref>, Section 5.4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Each of the nested SNP functional categories have marked differences in p-value distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005875.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) for the QuASAR test of ASH. Compared to what would be expected from the null uniform distribution, effect-hSNPs and switch-hSNPs have 8x and 14x times more SNPs with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 respectively, showing that our functional annotations can predict ASH. Furthermore, these enrichments for lower p-values are much higher than those of DHS-hSNPs (4x) and footprint-hSNPs (6x), indicating that identifying SNPs in DHS regions and/or footprints alone is not enough to predict functional effects on binding. A similar observation can be made using the observed allelic ratios across CENTIPEDE annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s033">S12 Fig</xref>). The result that SNPs that are just located in footprints or DHS regions tend to be silent is also true for other existing annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s034">S13 Fig</xref>) or if we change the threshold for discriminating between footprints-SNPs and effect-SNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s035">S14 Fig</xref>).

Note that we have not repeated the PROC analysis for the methods studied by [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but we used directly the results provided by them, as PROC analysis could be sensitive to a redefinition of the underlying true labels of the set used to evaluate performance (see discussion in Section 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s001">S1 Text</xref>). If we constrain the gk-SVM model to those predictions that overlap with our CENTIPEDE footprints, the precision (at 10% recall) improves to 80%. This indicates that SVMs are better sequence models than PWMs, but are not as specific without footprint information. To further investigate the TF-specificity accuracy of our annotations we used CTCF QTLs. CTCF is a very special type of TF with insulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], DNA loop organization [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and barrier functions [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Compared to training an SVM on the DNase-seq data-set (non TF-centric), models that are TF-centric such as CATO and our effect-SNPs (integrating the footprint and sequence preferences) demonstrate a superior accuracy in discriminating dsQTLs that are also CTCF QTLs from those that may affect other factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005875.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

This is likely because effect-SNPs in these regions have a major impact on regulatory processes that are shared across tissues.

This further confirms that changes in footprints active in a large number of tissues (constitutionally active) are more likely to have pleiotropic effects and therefore impact negatively the fitness of the organism and suggests polygenic mechanisms of evolution on motifs categories (i.e. groups of binding sites for a given TF or for TFs regulating genes with similar functions).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Evidence for motif-wise selection in TF binding sites</title><p>An important question in evolutionary biology is the extent to which selection has acted on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in humans [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Applying our modified motif-wise MK test, we obtained a selection score for TF motifs with a sufficient number of binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005875.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s017">S12 Table</xref>). At an FDR of 1%, we observe 84 factors whose binding sites are enriched for fixed functional differences (higher selection scores), suggestive of positive selection acting on those sites. Among the top scoring motifs are several factors that regulate neural and neuro-developmental processes, including POU1F1, PHOX2B, DBX2, UNCX, and YY1 which were not previously seen [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

While the interpretation of a positive selection score is generally that of positive selection, interpreting negative scores is more challenging. Generally, deleterious alleles are much less likely to reach fixation in populations than neutral alleles, however a negative selection score could also be explained by relaxation of selection or balancing selection. To identify the most likely evolutionary scenario for variation in binding motifs with negative selection scores, we calculated the derived allele frequency (DAF) for SNPs in binding sites.

These moderate but statistically significant enrichments are typical of other annotations as well and are likely due to the fact that: i) we only consider the strongest GWAS hits (missing variants with moderate and small effects), ii) not all the factors and tissues may have the same enrichment, and iii) lack of resolution, as expanding the GWAS hit region makes the enrichment effects more moderate. Nevertheless, if we add our annotation to category 2 SNPs from the RegulomeDB [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (SNPs with multiple regulatory annotations, but not yet shown to be functional), we detect a 1.6-fold enrichment for GWAS hits compared to category 2 SNPs alone (<italic>p</italic> = 6.11 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 95% CI: 1.27&#x02014;1.99).

This E2F footprint is active in &#x0003e;300 tissues (most of them fetal) and we detected ASH at this SNP in lung fibroblasts, validating that the reference allele at rs4519508 confers stronger binding than the alternate. Interestingly, in the reporter assay we observed 1.5-fold increased expression in the presence of the alternate allele, suggesting that at this location, E2F is acting as a repressor.

Our strategy integrates sequence information with functional genomics data to predict the impact of single nucleotide changes on tissue-specific TF binding. This is achieved while integrating footprint information that preserves the identity of the underlying factor with high specificity. By borrowing data from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics, we generated one of the most comprehensive catalogs available to date annotating regulatory regions and functional genetic variants across the genome.</p><p>Thus far, most common approaches for identifying regulatory variants from functional genomics data assume that each SNP in a regulatory region is equally likely to be functional. A key finding in this study is that genetic variants in active regulatory sequences, as defined by DNase I sensitivity and footprinting, are mostly silent; only 2.1% of SNPs in DHS regions and 3.1% of SNPs in CENTIPEDE footprints are estimated to have ASH. This is analogous to SNPs in coding regions, where most genetic changes are synonymous and do not result in an amino acid change [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The sequence model developed in this study provides a very useful filter for non-coding genetic variants that are not functional, resulting in a tissue-specific and motif-specific annotation of effect-SNPs (56.5% of which are estimated to have an impact on ASH). This is crucial information to take into account when we attempt to understand the molecular mechanism behind GWAS hits and evolutionary signals of selection. As additional functional genomics studies are performed, across larger sample sizes, tissue types and cellular conditions, it will be important to further determine the functional subset of regulatory variants within binding sites to achieve greater power in functionally annotating genetic variants associated with complex traits.</p><p>We find that genetic variants that are predicted to impact TF binding are depleted in the core promoter regions, exhibit higher sequence conservation in closely related species, tend to have low allele frequency and are enriched in tissue-specific footprints. These properties largely reflect the family-wise characteristics of motifs, which are further reflected in signals of selection. Future studies could incorporate tissue breath, conservation and distance to TSS as features to further filter effect-SNPs that may not show ASH. It should also be noted that our definition of functional regulatory variants is connected to the predicted effect on binding in the specific subset of cell-types/conditions that were available. Analyzing the allelic effects of non-coding variants in the context of other tissue types, conditions and functional genomic assays may potentially identify a functional role for some of the sites here defined as silent. In this study, we treated each TF separately, but future work should further explore the combinatorial grammar that different groups of motifs may define by cooperative binding to determine tissue specific binding sites. This will probably require more complex sequence models (e.g., SVMs [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] or deep neural networks [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]) than the PWMs used here. Here we show that the footprint information helps in predicting functional variants by further identifying the underlying TF compared to a sequence-fits-all model. More sophisticated footprint models [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] may also offer additional improvements to dissect the complexity of the regulatory grammar.</p><p>As not all genetic variants that have an impact on binding may lead to changes in gene expression and ultimately an organismal phenotype, combining these predictions with eQTL data across several tissues or environmental conditions would be important to further refine this annotation. As an example, Wen <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], using an early release of this annotation in lymphoblastoid cell-lines demonstrates that effect-SNPs are 1.49 fold (with 95%CI[1.38, 1.63]) more likely than baseline SNPs (SNPs that are not located in a footprint) to be eQTLs (<italic>p</italic> = 4.93 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;22</sup>); in contrast, silent footprint-SNPs are 1.15 fold (with 95%CI[1.04, 1.27]) enriched in eQTLs, comparing to baseline SNPs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0035).</p><p>A key feature of our annotation is that it spans a large collection of tissues and transcription factor motifs. This allowed us to trace some of the evolutionary history of TF binding and identify evolutionary constraints on specific molecular functions, which may reflect selective pressures during human history. For example, we observed that immune TFs are enriched for ASH sites, which supports the hypothesis that this may be a consequence of human adaptations to pathogen exposures [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. On the other hand, we identified neural development TFs that may have undergone positive selection in humans. The large number of regulatory variants predicted in our study, together with previously reported eQTL signals [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and the overall relevance that they have in explaining complex traits provide further support for polygenic models of complex traits in humans. By taking advantage of the factor-specific annotations in our study, we identified motifs that are enriched for regulatory variants associated with relevant GWAS traits and we provide examples of molecular mechanisms behind the association signals; e.g., immune TFs in the lipids study, and developmental TFs for height. Finally, we show how regulatory annotations improve the identification of potential causal SNPs in GWAS. Overall, the GWAS meta-analysis and selection signals in our study support the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites has been a major target of evolutionary forces and a key contributor to disease risk and complex phenotypes in human populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Identification of active regulatory sites and motif recalibration</title><p>We used 1,949 PWM sequence models (motifs) from the TRANSFAC [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and JASPAR [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] databases to scan the genome for a set of representative motif matches (Section 3.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s001">S1 Text</xref>).

To avoid overfitting and to heuristically reduce the search space, these low scoring motif instances are human sequences that have orthologous very high scoring motif instances in the chimp or rhesus genome. We then applied the CENTIPEDE model to survey TF activity for each 1,272,697 tissue-TF pair. For each pair we then determined that the TF is active if the sequence matches that exhibit a CENTIPEDE footprint can be predicted from the PWM score (Z-score &#x0003e; 5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s025">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s026">S5</xref> Figs).

While reduction in size of the credible set is very important for assessing fine-mapping methodologies, here our focus is on combining annotations to identify the single most likely causal SNP per GWAS locus.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Validation of GWAS-relevant effect-SNPs</title><p>GWAS-relevant effect-SNPs located in active footprints in LCLs (the cell line used for transfection) were ranked on the Spearman correlation coefficient in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s012">S7 Table</xref>. We initially selected the top 25 SNPs with a positive correlation, but the assays for 4 of them failed for several technical reasons (e.g., cloning step failed). To test allele-specific effects on expression for the remaining 21 SNPs, we first constructed inserts containing the reference or alternate allele for each SNP of interest (see Section 9.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005875.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Cloning of these inserts in the pGL4.23 vector was performed using the Infusion Cloning HD kit (Clontech) and DNA was extracted using the PureYield kit (Promega). Transfections were performed into GM18507 using the standard protocol for the Nucleofector electroporation (Lonza). Luciferase activity was measured for up to 20 replicate experiments using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). We contrasted the activity of each construct to the pGL4.23 vector, to assess enhancer/repressor activity of each region. To evaluate allele-specific effects, we contrasted the activity of the reference allele to the alternate allele for each region and we used a t-test to assess significance at a <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 threshold. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg [<xref rid="pgen.1005875.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] procedure to assess FDR across all 21 SNPs tested.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Enrichment analyses</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, tests for enrichment on two-way categorical variables are based on Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.
