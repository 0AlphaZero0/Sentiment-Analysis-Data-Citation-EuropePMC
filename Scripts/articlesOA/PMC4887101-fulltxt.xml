Tumors generally display sensitivity and selectivity toward Hsp90 inhibitors; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype remains undefined. We report that the mitotic checkpoint kinase Mps1 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue in the amino-domain of Hsp90. This, in turn, regulates chaperone function by reducing Hsp90 ATPase activity while fostering Hsp90 association with kinase clients, including Mps1. Phosphorylation of Hsp90 is also essential for the mitotic checkpoint because it confers Mps1 stability and activity. We identified Cdc14 as the phosphatase that dephosphorylates Hsp90 and disrupts its interaction with Mps1. This causes Mps1 degradation, thus providing a mechanism for its inactivation. Finally, Hsp90 phosphorylation sensitizes cells to its inhibitors, and elevated Mps1 levels confer renal cell carcinoma selectivity to Hsp90 drugs. Mps1 expression level can potentially serve as a predictive indicator of tumor response to Hsp90 inhibitors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="Abs2"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="P2">

Picard; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.pdf">https://www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.pdf</ext-link>) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Picard, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;hl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Taipale et al., 2010</xref>). Hsp90 clients are enriched in signal transducers, including protein kinases and transcription factors. Hsp90 and a distinct set of co-chaperone proteins such as Cdc37 &#x0201c;hold&#x0201d; these clients in a stabilized state in which they can respond to activating signals (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;hl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Taipale et al., 2010</xref>). Hsp90 chaperone activity is coupled to its ATPase activity (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Panaretou et al., 1998</xref>), which is tightly regulated by co-chaperone proteins and post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation (covered in detail in a recent review; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Walton-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Cancer cells rely on the Hsp90 chaperone machinery to protect an array of mutated and overexpressed oncoproteins from misfolding and degradation. Thus, Hsp90 is a critical facilitator of &#x0201c;oncogene addiction&#x0201d; and cancer cell survival. Emerging clinical data identify Hsp90 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat cancer (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Neckers and Trepel, 2014</xref>). Cancer cells appear to be particularly sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors compared to non-transformed cells (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chiosis and Neckers, 2006</xref>), and Hsp90 inhibitors are retained by tumors in vivo far longer than in normal tissues (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Kamal et al., 2003</xref>). However, the molecular basis of these phenomena remains undefined.</p><p id="P5">The mitotic checkpoint, or mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint prevents missegregation of chromosomes by arresting cells in metaphase until all chromosomes are properly aligned. The evolutionarily conserved dual specificity protein kinase, Mps1, is required for this process, as was recently reviewed in detail (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Winey, 2012</xref>). High expression and PTM of Mps1 are involved in its activation, whereas the major route of Mps1 inactivation is degradation (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Winey, 2012</xref>). Overexpression of Mps1 also causes abnormal chromosome segregation during mitosis, i.e., aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancers associated with high risk for tumorigenesis. (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kops et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). High levels of Mps1 kinase are found in colon cancer tissues and several tumor cell lines such as U937, HeLa, HEY, OCC1, Bewo, T987, and SW480 (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Yen and Kao, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the present study, we found that Mps1 is highly expressed in tumors from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary type I and type II RCC, oncocytoma, and angiomyolipoma (AML), compared to adjacent normal tissue. Accumulation of the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib (GB) in tumors from RCC patients prompted us to ask whether Mps1-mediated phosphorylation and regulation of Hsp90 chaperone function is the molecular basis of tumor sensitivity and selectivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S4"><title>Mps1 Phosphorylates a Conserved Threonine Residue of Yeast and Human Hsp90</title><p id="P7">Hsp90 is a post-translationally modified protein, (reviewed in <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Walton-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show the phosphorylation of T101 in the N-domain of yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) by using an assay that we have reported previously (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mollapour et al., 2011</xref>; see Experimental Procedures) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). T101 was mutated to a non-phosphorylatable alanine in yHsp90 that contained a PreScission protease cleavage site between the N-domain and the adjacent charged linker (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The wild-type (WT) yHsp90 and T101A mutant were also hexahistidine-tagged at their N-domains and were expressed as the sole copies of yHsp90 in yeast. The yHsp90-His<sub>6</sub> proteins were isolated from cell lysates using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose and then treated with PreScission protease to isolate yHsp90 N-domains. This was confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-hexahistidine antibody. Using our previously established pan-anti-phospho-threonine antibody (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mollapour et al., 2011</xref>), we were able to observe the threonine phosphorylation of yHsp90 N-domain, and this signal was significantly reduced in T101A-yHsp90 mutant (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We have also previously shown the phosphorylation of T22 in the N-domain of yHsp90 (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mollapour et al., 2011</xref>). Mutation of both T22 and T101 to non-phosphorylatable alanine completely abolished the threonine phosphorylation of N-domain yHsp90 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>). These data suggest that T22 and T101 are the only phospho-threonine sites in the yHsp90 N-domain.</p><p id="P8">Next, the corresponding T101 (i.e., T115) was mutated to alanine in hHsp90&#x003b1;-FLAG. This mutant also contained a PreScission site between the N-domain and the charged linker. This allowed us to transiently express and isolate the N-domain of hHsp90&#x003b1; from HEK293 cells and detect phosphorylation of the T115 site (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Previous work has shown that protein kinase C (PKC)&#x003b3; targets T115 in hHsp90&#x003b1; (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). We showed that PKC&#x003b3; phosphorylates hHsp90&#x003b1; or yHsp90 in vitro; however, we were unable to observe PKC&#x003b3;-dependent phosphorylation of T115-hHsp90&#x003b1; or T101-yHsp90 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>). Therefore, in an attempt to identify the kinase(s) targeting T101/T115, we used the yeast deletion library for the non-essential kinases (110 strains) obtained from EUROSCARF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euroscarf.de/search.php?name=Order">http://www.euroscarf.de/search.php?name=Order</ext-link>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2A and S2B</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). The yeast essential kinases library (19 kinases) under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic>-promoter was obtained from Dharmacon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dharmacon.gelifesciences.com/">http://dharmacon.gelifesciences.com/</ext-link>). These libraries were transformed with either WT yHsp90 or T101A mutant (containing the PreScission site), and then the levels of N-domain phosphorylation were assessed by western blot analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2C and S2D</xref>). We found that only overexpression of the essential protein kinase Mps1 causes an increase in the phosphorylation of T101-yHsp90 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, we used purified recombinant yeast Mps1 (yMps1) in an in vitro kinase assay with bacterially expressed and purified WT yHsp90 and T101A mutant. Our data showed that yMps1 phosphorylates only the T101 in yHsp90 in vitro (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Since Mps1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abrieu et al., 2001</xref>), we used the purified human Mps1 (hMps1), also known as PYT/TTK in an in vitro kinase assay. hMps1 phosphorylates only the T115 residue in hHsp90&#x003b1; in vitro (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>T101/T115 Phosphomutants Affect Hsp90 ATPase Activity and Co-chaperone Binding</title><p id="P9">The chaperone activity of Hsp90 is coupled to its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Panaretou et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, we expressed and isolated yHsp90 and the phosphomutants from yeast and determined their ATPase activity, using a small-scale PiPer Phosphate Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Kamal et al., 2003</xref>) (see Experimental Procedures). T101A had a similar (80%) ATPase activity compared to the WT yHsp90, whereas the T101E-yHsp90 ATPase was reduced by 62% (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>). Next, we expressed and purified yHsp90 and hHsp90&#x003b1; from bacteria and phosphorylated them in vitro using recombinant yMps1 and hMps1, respectively (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3B and S3C</xref>). The ATPase activity of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Hsp90 proteins were determined using the aforementioned method. Consistent with our earlier result, Mps1-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp90 reduced the ATPase activity of yHsp90 by 69% and of hHsp90&#x003b1; by 59% (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3D&#x02013;S3F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we examined the interaction of several important regulatory Hsp90 co-chaperones with T101-yHsp90 and T115-hHsp90&#x003b1; phosphomutants. Lysates of yeast expressing WT yHsp90, T101A, or T101E were subjected to affinity pull-down with Ni-NTA agarose, and interacting co-chaperones were examined by western blot analysis. The interaction of both mutants with yAha1 was abolished, interaction with Cdc37<sup>p50</sup> was significantly enhanced, and interaction with Sti1<sup>HOP</sup> was unchanged (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, association of Sba1<sup>p23</sup> with T101A was lost, but its interaction with T101E was slightly enhanced compared to the WT yHsp90 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We also obtained similar results with mammalian co-chaperones. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-hHsp90&#x003b1; or its T115A or T115E mutants. WT hHsp90&#x003b1; and its mutants interacted with p60<sup>HOP</sup> with similar affinity, while the mutants bound slightly stronger to p50<sup>Cdc37</sup> as compared to WT (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, association of both mutants with human Aha1 (hAha1) was abolished, and T115A interaction with p23 was significantly reduced (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that phosphorylation of T101/T115 is a dynamic process that stabilizes N-domain dimerization and Sba1<sup>p23</sup> association, which itself is known to slow the rate of ATP hydrolysis (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Siligardi et al., 2004</xref>). It follows that dephosphorylation of T101/T115 is necessary to permit ATP hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Phosphorylation of T101/T115 Selectively Impacts the Chaperoning of Clients</title><p id="P11">The importance of the T101 residue on chaperone activity was first reported 20 years ago (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Nathan and Lindquist, 1995</xref>). Here, we tested the ability of T101-yHsp90 phosphomutants to chaperone known endogenous clients in yeast. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase Mpk1/Slt2 (an Erk5 ortholog) is an Hsp90 client. Activation of this kinase with heat shock or caffeine stress strengthens its interaction with yHsp90 (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Truman et al., 2006</xref>). Mpk1/Slt2 from heat-shocked yeast cells (39&#x000b0;C for 40 min) or yeast stressed with 10 mM caffeine interacts with yHsp90. These stresses activate the cell wall integrity pathway in yeast. However, interaction of Mpk1/Slt2 with T101A-yHsp90 was significantly reduced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Conversely T101E-yHsp90 associated with Mpk1/Slt2, even in the absence of stress (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed similar data with another endogenous yeast Hsp90 client, active Ste11 kinase (Ste11&#x00394;N), the ortholog of mammalian Raf-1 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Flom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Louvion et al., 1998</xref>). The non-phosphorylatable T101A was unable to interact with the active Ste11 kinase, while association of the phosphomimic T101E mutant with active Ste11 was slightly enhanced compared to wild-type Hsp90 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we examined the impact of T101 phosphomutants on the chaperoning of two non-kinase clients. The mammalian glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a well-characterized Hsp90 client that provides an Hsp90 functional assay in yeast (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Pratt et al., 2004</xref>). WT yeast cells, as well as the T101A and T101E mutants, were transformed with plasmids constitutively expressing GR and a glucocorticoid-regulated <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Garabedian and Yamamoto, 1992</xref>). In this case, the GR activity was almost four times higher in the T101A mutant than in the WT cells; conversely, the phosphomimetic T101E mutant showed impaired GR activity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we tested the effect of T101 phosphorylation on Heat shock factor-1 (Hsf1) transcriptional activity. Hsf1 is an Hsp90 client, and its interaction with this chaperone suppresses Hsf1 activity (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). Hsp90 inhibition, due to mutation or pharmacologic inhibition, leads to induction of Hsf1 activity in the absence of heat shock stress (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Hjorth-S&#x000f8;rensen et al., 2001</xref>). Temperature sensitivity of the T101I mutant has been reported previously (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Nathan and Lind-quist, 1995</xref>). Here, we showed the phosphomutant T101E to be temperature sensitive (ts) at 30&#x000b0;C and T101A at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The heat shock response in the T101A mutant upon heat stress was 1.5-fold higher than in WT yeast cells but was 2-fold lower than in WT for the T101E mutant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We observed similar results with T115-hHsp90&#x003b1; phosphomutants. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with the Hsp90 kinase client, ErbB2, and one of the following constructs: WT hHsp90&#x003b1;-FLAG, T115A, or T115E mutants. While we were able to co-immunoprecipitate ErbB2 with the WT hHsp90&#x003b1;-FLAG, ErbB2 interaction with T115A was significantly reduced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We obtained similar data with endogenous Cdk4 (another Hsp90 kinase client) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Interaction of the phosphomimetic mutant T115E with both ErbB2 and Cdk4 was slightly increased (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Consistent with our observation in yeast, T115A-hHsp90&#x003b1; interaction with GR was significantly increased, whereas T115E-hHsp90&#x003b1; association with GR was completely abolished (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). These data show that phosphorylation of T101/T115 increases the interaction with, and activity of, several kinase clients but inhibits the interaction/activity of the steroid hormone receptor GR.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Phosphorylation of T101/T115 Is Essential for Mps1 Activity and Mitotic Checkpoint</title><p id="P13">Previous work has suggested that co-chaperones Cdc37 and Sti1 are involved in the chaperoning of yMps1 (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schutz et al., 1997</xref>).

This phenomenon was reversed by pre-treating the yeast cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We next evaluated yMps1 protein stability in Hsp90-T101 phosphomutants by cycloheximide (CHX) chase analysis and found that yMps1-Myc was markedly stable in WT and T101E yeast cells.

Previous work has shown that overexpression of yMps1 causes cell cycle arrest at G2 but with morphologically normal spindles (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick et al., 1996</xref>).

Next, we overexpressed yMps1-GST under the <italic>GAL1</italic>-promoter in WT or T101A mutant yeast.

In agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick et al., 1996</xref>), overexpression of yMps1 arrested WT cells in G2, but it had no effect in T101A mutant yeast (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Mps1 kinase is essential for the mitotic checkpoint (also known as the spindle checkpoint); therefore, Mps1 deletion is lethal in yeast (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abrieu et al., 2001</xref>). The ts mps1-1 mutant is viable at the permissive temperature (25&#x000b0;C). We synchronized the WT, mps1-1, and T101A-yHsp90 yeast cells in G1, with an &#x003b1;-factor at 25&#x000b0;C. The cells were then released in medium containing the microtubule poison nocodazole, a known activator of the mitotic checkpoint, for a further incubation of 4 hr at either 25&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C. WT, mps1-1, and T101A cells were arrested with large buds in nocodazole-containing medium at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). In contrast, after 4 hr in medium containing nocodazole at 37&#x000b0;C, T101A mutants, like mps1-1 yeast, had multiple-budded cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).

Next, we examined the phosphorylation status of T101 in the N-domain of yHsp90 using the PreScission cleavage procedure (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mollapour et al., 2011</xref>). Over-expression of Cdc55 did not change the threonine phosphorylation of N-domain yHsp90, whereas overexpression of Cdc14 reduced the threonine phosphorylation of the N-domain (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>). To investigate whether Cdc14 directly targets T101, we used bacterially expressed and purified WT yHsp90-His<sub>6</sub> and T101A mutant bound to Ni-NTA agarose. We also overexpressed and purified <italic>GAL1-yMPS1-MYC</italic> from yeast by immunoprecipitation. Purified yMps1-Myc was salt-stripped with 0.5 M NaCl to disrupt co-immunoprecipitated proteins. We found that yMps1 phosphorylates only T101 in yHsp90 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Our in vitro data also showed that T101A-yHsp90 mutant did not form a complex with yMps1. This result suggests that yMps1 only targets T101, and this is essential for yHsp90-yMps1 complex formation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These data are in agreement with our in vivo findings (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Next, we incubated the phosphorylated T101-yHsp90 with immunoprecipitated and salt-stripped Cdc14-GST from yeast. This phosphatase had the ability to dephosphorylate T101 and then form a strong complex with de-phosphorylated yHsp90. Interestingly, yMps1 was dissociated from yHsp90 under these conditions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We confirmed these data by isolating hexahistidine-epitope-tagged yHsp90 proteins from cell lysates using Ni-NTA agarose beads. The endogenous Cdc14 interaction with yHsp90 was assessed by immunoblotting using anti-Cdc14 antibody (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Cdc14 interacted with the WT yHsp90, and this association was significantly enhanced with the non-phosphorylatable T101A mutant (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Conversely, the phosphomimetic T101E mutant did not associate with the Cdc14-GST. Our data suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of T101-Hsp90 may be part of the regulation of the cell cycle. We validated this point by synchronizing yeast cells in G1 using an &#x003b1;-factor and then releasing in media containing nocodazole in order to arrest the cells in mitosis (early anaphase) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Conversely, yeast cells were also arrested in mitosis and then released in media with an &#x003b1;-factor. Cell cycle status was examined every 15 min. Next, we isolated the N-domain yHsp90-His<sub>6</sub> by using the PreScission protease cleavage and monitored the phosphorylation of T101 by western blot analysis. Our earlier data have shown that T22 and T101 are the only phospho-threonine sites in the yHsp90 N-domain (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>). Since T22 phosphorylation does not change at different stages of the cell cycle (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mollapour et al., 2011</xref>), we concluded that the change in the threonine phosphorylation of N-domain yHsp90 is because of the modification of T101. Our data show that T101 is not phosphorylated in G1, and as cells undergo mitosis, the levels of T101 phosphorylation increases significantly (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). This is consistent with yMps1 increase in mitosis and absence of the phosphatase Cdc14 from G1 to mitosis (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Next, we examined T101 phosphorylation in cells exiting mitosis and entering G1.

T101 is located within the lid segment of yHsp90, and in the &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; conformation, the side chain of T101 packs into a hydrophobic cavity formed by the side chains of I12 and L15 and by the C&#x003b1; and C&#x003b2; of E11. Upon N-domain dimerization, this interaction is disrupted and exposes the side chain of T101 on the top surface of the lid. Mutations to alanine or glutamic acid stabilize the hydrophobic interaction in the &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; conformation and destabilize the exposure of the side chain in the &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; conformation.

In terms of interaction with co-chaperones, neither non-phosphorylatable nor phosphomimic mutants in yeast or human Hsp90 bound to Aha1; however, both mutants had a strong interaction with Cdc37.

We were also unable to show yeast PKC1-mediated phosphorylation of T101 in yeast overexpressing PKC1.</p><p id="P26">We screened the yeast non-essential kinase deletion as well as essential kinase overexpression libraries and identified yMps1 as the kinase targeting T101-yHsp90. yMps1 is an evolutionarily conserved dual-specificity protein kinase required for (1) duplication of centrosomes in metazoans or spindle pole body (SPB) in yeast and (2) the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (also known as the mitotic checkpoint) (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Winey, 2012</xref>). However, its primary cellular substrate has remained elusive. Previous work has demonstrated that yMps1 activity requires the co-chaperone Cdc37 (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schutz et al., 1997</xref>). yMps1 is essential in eukaryotic cells, and it was shown that both conditional and non-conditional alleles of <italic>cdc37</italic> are lethal in combination with the <italic>mps1-1</italic> ts mutant in yeast (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schutz et al., 1997</xref>).

Our data show that Mps1 is a bona fide Hsp90 client, and its phosphorylation of T101-yHsp90 and T115-hHsp90&#x003b1; is required for mitotic arrest. Our data also show that yMps1 does not stably interact with the non-phos-phorylatable T101A-yHsp90 mutant, suggesting that yMps1-mediated phosphorylation stabilizes interaction of this kinase with Hsp90. It is noteworthy that our proteomic data did not identify yMps1 interaction with T101E-yHsp90. This might be because of the low abundance of yMps1 kinase in cells (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Winey, 2012</xref>). Our quantitative proteomic analysis, however, identified the Cdc14 phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of T101. Our data suggest a regulatory paradigm in which Mps1 phosphorylation of Hsp90 leads to formation of a strong complex between these two proteins and, consequently, causes mitotic arrest. The Cdc14 phosphatase dephosphorylates T101 and disrupts the Mps1-Hsp90 complex. This leads to the degradation of Mps1.

(4) Possible dissociation of Cdc14 allows yMps1 binding and restarting the phosphorylation cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms787635f6"/></fig><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Mps1-Mediated Phosphorylation of Hsp90 Sensitizes Cells to Hsp90 Drugs and Confers Tumor Selectivity to Hsp90 Inhibitors</title><p>(A) Yeast expressing yHsp90-His<sub>6</sub> (WT), and indicated phospho-T101 mutants were spotted at a 1:10 dilution series of 10<sup>7</sup> cells per milliliter on YPDA agar containing 60 &#x003bc;M Hsp90 inhibitor SNX2112 or GB.
