<bold>Background</bold>: The presence of bacteria and fungi in medicinal or recreational
<italic>Cannabis </italic>poses a potential threat to consumers if those microbes include pathogenic or toxigenic species. This study evaluated two widely used culture-based platforms for total yeast and mold (TYM) testing marketed by 3M Corporation and Biom&#x000e9;rieux, in comparison with a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach marketed by Medicinal Genomics Corporation.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>: A set of 15 medicinal
<italic>Cannabis</italic> samples were analyzed using 3M and Biom&#x000e9;rieux culture-based platforms and by qPCR to quantify microbial DNA. All samples were then subjected to next-generation sequencing and metagenomics analysis to enumerate the bacteria and fungi present before and after growth on culture-based media.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: Several pathogenic or toxigenic bacterial and fungal species were identified in proportions of &#x0003e;5% of classified reads on the samples, including
<italic>Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ralstonia pickettii, Salmonella enterica, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aspergillus ostianus, Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium citrinum </italic>and
<italic> Penicillium steckii.</italic> Samples subjected to culture showed substantial shifts in the number and diversity of species present, including the failure of
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species to grow well on either platform. Substantial growth of
<italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> and other bacteria were frequently observed on one or both of the culture-based TYM platforms. The presence of plant growth promoting (beneficial) fungal species further influenced the differential growth of species in the microbiome of each sample.</p><p>

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The microbiome of
<italic>Cannabis</italic> leaves and flowers includes bacteria and fungi residing on the exterior surface of these tissues (epiphytes) as well as those residing within the plant tissues (endophytes). While epiphytic microbes may originate from many sources like aerosols, dusts and liquids, or via human contact, endophytes typically gain entry from the rhizosphere via root junctions, and subsequent translocation through the xylem
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Considering this and the known impact that the soil and root microbiome has on plant growth and development
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, all sources of microbial inputs, including below ground compartments should be considered important for optimal
<italic>Cannabis</italic> growth and consumer safety
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Studies on the natural Cannabis microbiome have identified several species of culturable endophytic fungi, including
<italic>Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium copticola</italic> (a member of the citrinum section
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>) and several
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Similar studies looking at culturable bacterial endophytes identified nearly a dozen isolates from the Bacillus clade and two mycobacteria
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Of those
<italic>Bacillus</italic> species,
<italic>B. subtilis</italic>,
<italic>B. lichenoformis</italic> and
<italic>B. pumilis</italic> have been isolated as endophytes and have been shown to be beneficial to growth in other plant species
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Finally, a recent investigation of the fungal microbiome in a number of dispensary-derived
<italic>Cannabis</italic> samples identified numerous species including some toxigenic Penicillia and Aspergilli
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. While there have not been any reported cases of
<italic>Cannabis</italic>-related mycotoxin poisoning resulting from
<italic>Penicillium</italic> infections, there have been numerous reported cases of serious or fatal pulmonary Aspergillosis associated with marijuana smoking in immunocompromised patients
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;

<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Denver&#x02019;s Department of Environmental Health has also issued warnings related to

<italic>Cannabis</italic> markets rely on a patchwork of testing regulations to protect patients and consumers. In terms of microbial testing, these vary widely from state to state. States such as Maine, Michigan, and Arizona currently do not impose testing regulations, while several states such as Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Mexico have adopted regulations based on the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and American Herbal Pharmacopeia (AHP) recommended guidelines
<sup><xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Specifically, the AHP recommends appropriate methods for testing microbial loads be adopted from the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm2006949.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm2006949.htm</ext-link>). State regulators frequently use AHP guidelines to set limits of 10
<sup>5</sup> CFU/g for Total Aerobic Bacteria (TAC), 10
<sup>4</sup> CFU/g for Total Yeast and Mold (TYM), 10
<sup>3</sup> CFU/g for Total Coliform and
<italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and &#x0003c; 1 CFU/g for pathogenic
<italic>E</italic>.
<italic>coli</italic> and
<italic>Salmonella</italic> species. The AHP states, &#x0201c;It is important to note that microbial and fungal values do not typically represent pass or fail criteria and recommended limits may require adjustment over time.&#x0201d; New York and Hawaii specify some additional genera for testing such as
<italic>Aspergillus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Mucor,</italic> and
<italic>Penicillium</italic>. A few States require that testing laboratories follow the procedures outlined in the USP for microbiological examination of non-sterile products. Others allow testing laboratories to choose from a wide variety of technologies designed for the food testing industry. However, there is no peer-reviewed research supporting the effectiveness and validity of any of these protocols for
<italic>Cannabis</italic> microbial testing. Furthermore, no studies to date have examined the impact of beneficial endophytes on the
<italic>Cannabis</italic> microbiome and on microbial testing results.</p><p>Here we present a next generation sequencing survey of DNA sampled directly from cured cannabis flowers before and after culturing using 3M Rapid Yeast and Mold Petrifilm

The failure rates for the BMX AC and qPCR TAC assays were 13% (2/15) and 7% (1/15), respectively. An additional set of TYM qPCR tests were performed after growth on the BMX platform, resulting in 12/15 failures and confirming the presence of live, culturable fungi in 80% of the samples. The 3M TYM and BMX YM systems performed similarly in terms of pass/fail, with only one discrepancy, which had a value close to the failure threshold. The TYM-qPCR assay passed seven samples that failed on at least one of the two culture-based platforms. One of those (sample 4) had an elevated quantitation cycle (Cq) value approaching the failure threshold; the rest (samples 11&#x02013;16) gave high Cq values, indicating very low fungal DNA levels (

<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The sequencing procedure utilizes two PCR steps instead of the single PCR step used in qPCR (and does not utilize an internal probe for signal generation). Sample quantities are normalized prior to the Nextera reaction to ensure consistent shearing. These procedures are optimized to yield 1 million reads or more per sample for high sensitivity, but the read numbers are not proportional to microbial counts in the starting samples. Instead, the classified read counts and percentages simply indicate the genera or species present at detectable levels and their approximate proportions (with the caveat that the target amplicons from some species may amplify with lower efficiency owing to primer mismatches or extremes of G+C content). The qPCR Cq measured directly from extracted plant material provides the best inter-sample comparative metric. BLAST results from clustered OTUs were used to confirm prevalent species assignments on a case-by-case basis, but the results are not presented here owing to the very large number of OTUs generated by the USEARCH software (&#x0003e;12,000 across the full sample set).</p><p>Sequencing reproducibility: 14 frozen samples were amplified with ITS2 primers and sequenced 30&#x02013;60 days apart; 13 of the comparative R square values for classified fungal species were greater than 0.999 and the remaining one was 0.966. Similarly, 20 frozen samples were amplified with 16S primers and sequenced 30&#x02013;60 days apart; 18 of the comparative R square values for classified bacterial species were greater than 0.999 and the remaining two averaged was 0.998. These data imply highly reproducible genomic surveys of the amplified DNA present. No Template Controls (NTC) were also tested, producing very high Cq readings (&#x0003e;35) and very few classified reads (251 with TAC primers and 61 with TYM primers) controlling for the possibility of labware contamination contributing to the observed signals.</p><p>Specificity: To verify the specificity of the analysis for accurate discrimination between bacterial and fungal genera, we ran CLARK-S against the bacterial and fungal databases separately at the genus level using either 16S or ITS2 reads. There were 13,913,520 16S reads classified as bacterial, 2,293 16S reads classified as fungal, 6,220,745 ITS2 reads classified as fungal, and 241,351 ITS2 reads classified as bacterial (

Five of those (numbers 11, 12, 14&#x02013;16) had elevated qPCR TAC signals, suggesting that the growth of bacteria could be contributing to colony counts and failures in the culture-based TYM tests. Sequencing results for each of those samples, before and after culture in BMX medium, confirm the presence of actively growing bacteria, and reveals the bacterial genera that are primarily responsible for the TAC-qPCR signals:

<italic>Cannabis</italic> growth facilities located in a humid coastal environment (Eastern Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island). They were enriched for samples that failed on either or both the 3M and BMX platforms, which are commonly used to test for bacteria, yeast and mold in the industry. Quantitative PCR was evaluated as a third approach to hopefully resolve discrepancies. The high failure rate observed in this study should not be taken as representative of industry-wide averages, which have been reported elsewhere
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. The sample set provided an opportunity to investigate the diversity of species that grow in different culture-based platforms as well as to characterize the microorganisms that were responsible for the sample failures.</p><p>Metagenomic sequencing data were collected on 15 samples, directly from plant material and after culture on both the 3M and BMX platforms. The sequencing results demonstrate substantial shifts in presence and abundance of bacterial and fungal species after growth on the two platforms. Thus both of the culture-based platforms are detecting and enumerating only a subset of the species present, and the final composition of microbes after growth is markedly different from the starting sample. Most concerning is the frequent identification of bacterial species in systems designed for the exclusive quantification of yeast and mold, as quantified by elevated TAC Cq values after culture in the BMX TYM medium. These observations call into question the specificity claims of these culture-based testing platforms. The presence of bacterial colonies on TYM growth plates or cards may falsely increase the rejection rate of
<italic>Cannabis</italic> samples for fungal contamination, and induce growers to increase the use of fungicides unnecessarily.</p><p>Classified reads corresponding to many pathogenic and/or toxigenic bacteria and fungi were detected on plant material, including the following at proportions of over 5%:
<italic>Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter pittii, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ralstonia pickettii, Salmonella enterica, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Penicillium citrinum, Aspergillus ostianus, Penicillium steckii and Aspergillus sydowii.</italic> While the proportions of classified reads corresponding to these organisms were generally low, there were several striking exceptions: &#x0003e;10&#x02013;35%
<italic>R. picketti</italic> in 9/15 samples, 97%
<italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in one sample, 41%
<italic>E. coli</italic> in one sample, 16&#x02013;35%
<italic>A. baumanii</italic> in two samples, 10&#x02013;85%
<italic>P. olsonii</italic> in five samples, 10&#x02013;72%
<italic>P. citrinum</italic> in 13 samples, and 21%
<italic>A. ostianus</italic> in one sample. The CLARK-S classification software has been reported to have very high sensitivity and precision for sequence assignments
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, further work is required to confirm these species assignments and to check for the presence of toxins that may be produced by these microbes. The observations certainly call into question the wisdom of species-agnostic microbial quantitation for a product like medicinal
<italic>Cannabis,</italic> which is used by many seriously ill or immunocompromised patients.</p><p>Cross-platform comparisons demonstrate that certain bacteria and fungi grow well on 3M plates, but not on BMX, or
<italic>vice versa</italic>. There are certainly differences in terms of the media. For example, BMX medium includes chloramphenicol to suppress bacterial growth, and uses sealed growth chambers that may limit oxygen availability. The observation of anaerobic
<italic>Clostridium</italic> species such as
<italic>C. botulinum</italic> in proportions up to 35% of bacterial reads at the genus level on the BMX platform along with
<italic>B. coagulans,</italic> a facultative anaerobe, suggests that the sealed BMX YM cards generate anaerobic conditions.
<italic>B. coagulans</italic> is rhizobacterium that has been reported to promote growth in
<italic>Solanum</italic> seedlings in concert with mycorrhizal fungi
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.</p><p>
<italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> was only detected at very low levels before growth on BMX medium, and was not detected on 3M plates. Previous white papers have suggested
<italic>C. botulinum</italic> is not a threat in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> due to its anaerobic nature (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cannabissafetyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Microbiological-Safety-Testing-of-Cannabis.pdf">http://cannabissafetyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Microbiological-Safety-Testing-of-Cannabis.pdf</ext-link>). However,
<italic>C. botulinum</italic> should not be considered an irrelevant threat in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> because it is known to vascularize as an endophyte in plants and produce pasteurization resistant spores
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Additionally, proximity between cultivation and processing may lead to contamination of finished products such as emulsified oils or concentrated extracts containing water. Media such as these provide anaerobic conditions and nutrients sufficient for
<italic>C. botulinum</italic> and other anaerobes to thrive. This is most threatening to indoor cultivation facilities which also process, store, and package finished products on site, often in sub-optimal storage conditions. The fact that the organism was observed to proliferate in the BMX system suggests that its presence, even at low levels, could be a potential concern in emulsified
<italic>Cannabis</italic> oil formulations or edible products that are stored in closed containers.</p><p>Of greater potential concern than the bacterial growth is the failure of both culture-based TYM platforms to support efficient growth and detection of
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, which were present in proportions of 18&#x02013;58% of classified ITS2 reads at the genus level in 10/15 samples. Initially, it was suspected that the significant TYM qPCR and read counts might derive from dead cells, perhaps as a result of growers attempting to sterilize the plant material. Quantitative PCR data using active cultures grown in TSB, however, indicates that CFU counts from two
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species inoculated onto 3M TYM petri film were ~1000&#x000d7; lower than expected based on qPCR Cq values that accurately predict CFUs in other species (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Elevated Cq values due to ribosomal DNA copy number amplification does not seem a likely explanation because the estimated copy numbers of several
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species are similar to those of other fungi
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. While the presence of spores with a slow germination rate
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> could explain the results on plant material, it does not explain the qPCR result using active cultures. Another factor could be the obligate hyphal growth nature of
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, wherein each colony forming unit may contain hundreds of interconnected hyphal cells.</p><p>These findings are surprising, and therefore a third culture-based system, manufactured by Biolumix, was tested for its ability to detect
<italic>A. fumigatus</italic> after 48 hours of growth at 26&#x000b0;C following inoculation from a saturated TSB culture. The result was negative. The failure of three different culture-based platforms to detect
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> species suggests the need for caution in the use of such platforms. Validation data for the detection of
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> on 3M rapid TYM Petri-film presented in 3M&#x02019;s marketing material
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> is for culture at 25&#x000b0;C, whereas the instructions for use specify culture at room temperature (~4&#x000b0;C below 25&#x000b0;C). McClenny
<sup><xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> recommends longer times and higher temperatures to accurately detect
<italic>Aspergilli</italic> with culture based methods. The 3M films used in this study were incubated at 25 &#x000b1; 1.0&#x000b0;C for 72 hours and still showed low efficacy detecting
<italic>Aspergilli</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> is arguably the most significant fungal threat in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> cultivation. Aspergillosis has been reported in numerous immunocompromised patients and, to date accounts for the only clinical reports of fatalities associated with an infectious organism linked to
<italic>Cannabis</italic> consumption
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Vonberg
<italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated a 57% fatality rate for Aspergillosis in hospital-bound immunocompromised patients, while also demonstrating airborne infectability at or below 1 CFU/cubic meter
<sup><xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Growers may pasteurize
<italic>Cannabis</italic> samples to avoid failing culture-based microbial testing, but
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> spores are pasteurization resistant
<sup><xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, as are the toxins they produce
<sup><xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, so pasteurization does not eliminate the potential risk from these organisms.</p><p>Another interesting observation is the apparent growth inhibition of
<italic>Penicillium</italic> species (
<italic>P. citrinum, P. brevicompactum, P. olsonii</italic> and
<italic>P. quercetorum</italic>) in several samples with high proportions of
<italic>Trichoderma, Fusarium, Rhodotorula</italic> or
<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> reads after culture (samples 1,2,4,7 and 16). Other classified species that failed to grow in some of those samples include
<italic>Furcaspora eucalypti</italic> and
<italic>Tilletiopsis pallescens</italic>. Organic growth practices often utilize beneficial bacterial or fungal endophytes
<sup><xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> to promote crop growth and to enable lower chemical fungicide use. For example,
<italic>Trichoderma</italic> species are known to synthesize &#x003b2;-1,3 gluconases and a chitinase which work synergistically to break down the cell walls of other fungi
<sup><xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. The State of Nevada has issued guidelines for allowable pesticides for use in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> cultivation that include various
<italic>Trichoderma</italic> and
<italic>Bacillus</italic> species
<sup><xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. However, in most states, the use of such beneficial microbes may be precluded by the requirement for stringent yeast and mold testing that does not discriminate between beneficial and harmful microorganisms. More specific nucleic acid based testing techniques can resolve this. The FDA is moving in this direction for food safety testing with the GenomeTrakr Network
<sup><xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>.</p><p>Finally, as observed in a previous study on the
<italic>Cannabis</italic> fungal microbiome in a different sample set
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>,
<italic>P. citrinum</italic> is highly prevalent in the samples tested here. This species has been isolated as a growth promoting endophyte in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> and several other plant species
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>.
<italic>P. citrinum</italic> produces the nephrotoxin citrinin, although it is not clear whether the presence of citrinin in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> flowers or extracts represents an actual health threat. However, the high prevalence of
<italic>P. citrinum</italic> in
<italic>Cannabis</italic> samples suggests that it is an area worthy of further investigation.</p><p>These data have several limitations. Quantitative inter-sample comparisons cannot be performed with the sequencing data at present due to the lack of internal controls to help calibrate any pooling or sampling issues throughout the workflow. The qPCR data can be used to estimate inter-sample bacterial or fungal burden but these data do not always resolve to the genus or species level. Intra-sample comparisons can nonetheless provide information on the relative proportions of bacterial or fungal species. Sampling from BMX cards was straightforward, since it uses a liquid culture medium, but 3M sampling was subject to bias in scraping off colonies from culture plates. Additionally, the use of Nextera shearing and primer amplification may introduce some biases due to transposon integration preferences. The fragmentation approach is necessary to avoid ITS2 amplicon size bias in Illumina MiSeq clustering
<sup><xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Culture based techniques used to measure the microbial burden and establish safety of
<italic>Cannabis</italic> have several shortcomings. States adopt and implement regulations at different tolerance thresholds for bacteria and fungi without specifically detailing standardized methods or coordinating inter-laboratory ring testing. Yeast and mold counts from the culture-based platforms tested here are confounded by the growth of bacteria - even when antibiotics like chloramphenicol are included. The microbiome in the plant material tested changes radically after culturing, such that the microbes and counts that are finally observed bear little or no resemblance to those of the starting sample. This represents a classic observer effect, where the act of measuring the microbial composition using these culture-based methods fundamentally changes that composition - which is a well-studied phenomenon known as the &#x0201c;great plate-count anomaly&#x0201d;
<sup><xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup>. This is a serious issue, which clearly has implications beyond Cannabis safety testing. The 3M and BMX platforms tested here are also used widely in the food testing industry.</p><p>Perhaps the most concerning observation is that one of the most regulated of fungal pathogens,
<italic>Aspergillus -</italic> the only microbe to ever be associated with clinical harm concerning cannabis - grows poorly, and is therefore severely under-reported by current culture-based platforms. The differential growth of other toxigenic fungi, depending on the companion species present, further influences the results. Bacterial pathogens are not uncommon, and beneficial bacteria are also capable of influencing the growth or inhibition of other flora.</p><p>We have demonstrated that molecular testing is capable of accurately quantifying and identifying a wide spectrum of microorganisms present on
<italic>Cannabis</italic> samples, while avoiding false positives due to the presence of bacteria for fungal testing. Molecular testing is rapid and is capable of distinguishing between harmful and beneficial microbes &#x02013; permitting the use of the latter in organic cultivation practices to eliminate the need for reliance on chemical fungicides.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: &#x000a9; 2016 McKernan K et al.</p><p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).

As strong proponents of open science, we engage to provide an objective assessment of the work presented here and to make suggestions aimed at improving the clarity and readability of the present work.</p><p> The microbiome (the collection of microbial genomes present on an organism or in an environment) has emerged as an additional dimension (in addition to genomic, epigenomic, metabolomic and phenotypic data&#x02026;) from which one can harness cryptic information that may contribute to a particular biological phenomenon. Novel technical advances have enabled a metagenomic approach in which one can isolate and enumerate bacterial and fungal genus/species from environmental samples. In their paper, McKernan
<italic>et al. </italic>compare the performance of traditional culture based techniques with commercial qPCR kits in terms of accuracy and ability to detect different types of microbes, with an emphasis on prokaryotic organisms, which was so far underrepresented in previous published work (including a recent F1000 research paper by the same lead author).</p><p> We support the authors&#x02019; work and understand that as pioneers in the Cannabis microbiome space, they are currently laying the foundation on which further development of assays will likely rely strongly. As such, much of our comments relate to improving the transparency of their results. We pose several questions/comments, which the author may choose to incorporate into updated versions of this paper. Overall, the paper is very well written and we do not have any editorial suggestions, except for the spelling of Biomerieux, which in one instance requires the accent aigu: &#x0201c;&#x000e9;&#x0201d;. Below, please find minor comments, which we would like to authors to consider:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We are in agreement with review 1 (Ethan Russo) that the abstract could be improved if word limit permits. We particularly think that the concluding statement could incorporate a stronger statement about the application of their approach in the Cannabis industry.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A short statement on why the comparison between culture-based platforms and DNA-based detection is relevant (e.g. in &#x0201c;Background&#x0201d;) would be of general interest to the readership.</p></list-item></list> &#x000a0;</p><p>
<underline>Introduction</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We found the introduction to lack a common thread and rather abruptly &#x0201c;jumps&#x0201d; between the primary objectives of the paper: methodological comparison between different microorganism detection techniques, microbe-microbe interactions and health implications: e.g.&#x000a0;in paragraph 1 the authors focus on microbiome-ecological considerations. Then again in paragraph 3, they bring up plant-microbe/microbe-microbe interaction although the rest of this paragraph is focus on methodologies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The statement
<italic>&#x0201d;&#x02026;no studies have examined the impact of beneficials&#x02026;&#x0201d;</italic> does not make much sense there. Perhaps the considerations about
<italic>Trichoderma</italic> could be saved for the discussion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some brief background on the two culture platforms (3M, BMX) would help frame the need for other novel technologies in microbial detection. &#x000a0;</p></list-item></list>
<underline>Methods</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As a general comment to all sections from hereon, it would be helpful to have the same sub-headings (as much as possible) logically flow from methods to results and into the discussion points:</p></list-item></list> e.g. &#x000a0;

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It would be valuable to share some information about their standard curve and how they derived their Cq values of 21 and 26 cycles for TYM and TAC assays respectively.

Another angle to tackle this is to implement diversity analyses on the microbial community data using either Shannon&#x02019;s diversity index or some other metric such as alpha- and beta- diversity in each sample. While sample size is likely limiting, are there other similarities between samples for common origins?

<underline>Discussion</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It seems counterintuitive that qPCR, being more sensitive than plating approach, would fail the lowest number of samples out of all approaches: Is the BMX positive bias toward
<italic>C. botulinum</italic> a false positive or is the lack of
<italic>C.&#x000a0;botulinum</italic> detection by qPCR a false negative?</p></list-item><list-item><p>In that vein, it would be helpful to describe your strategy to assess false positives, i.e. how many negative controls were implemented? Any negative control with botulism?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Failure thresholds are subjective in nature, please expand on how the Cq threshold is superior, what microbial load (e.g. ng of DNA) do each of the two Cq thresholds correspond to?</p></list-item><list-item><p>We found that while a large and varied bacterial assemblage was identified here, it would be important to note that modern Cannabis such as the 15 samples presented here have likely gone through several genetic and microbiotic bottlenecks. A recent paper on the Agave microbiome
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-16859-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>&#x000a0;demonstrates the paucity of the microbiome in domesticated/farmed plants compared to wild relatives, likely due to the pervasive effects of monoculture. While the Cannabis domestication process is convoluted and masked by prohibition, it is likely that the same pattern is observed in Cannabis. Characterizing the genetic profiles of Cannabis, along with the microbiome of wild Cannabis accessions will likely yield enhanced inference in terms of the underlying mechanisms related to plant growth and disease tolerance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A larger part of the discussion should be dedicated to the community composition shift before and after culturing. Especially some considerations about the biological relevance of this shift: i.e. are the pathogens that grow on the plate relevant for human health/plant growth considerations? Or the other way round: are the pathogens detected before culturing relevant for human health/plant growth&#x000a0;issues? It would be good to more explicitly separate what the authors think are artifacts caused by different methodologies (community shifts) with biologically relevant phenomena.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If the authors found polymorphisms in OTUs, they may want to suggest the application of the Cannabis microbiome to provide higher resolution to clustering exercises in highly related or poly-hybridized Cannabis accessions. This may also be used to trace the origin of&#x000a0;particular dispensary samples to a cultivator or methodology of plant growth as using hydroponics, soil, aquaponics, etc. will likely influence the Cannabis rhizospheres and phyllospheres.&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>While the authors discuss the presence of

Although the study provides some valuable data into some of the short comings of culture based methods it has some experimental design weaknesses that make it difficult to draw strong conclusions from this data set.&#x000a0;</p><p> Introduction:</p><p> Since the purpose of the study is to discuss the difference between a qPCR based microbial testing platform with culture based methods the introduction should focus more on discussing this in other industries. For example it's becoming well known that only a small percentage of organisms that exist in nature are easily cultured on the most common forms of media used. Rapid advances in sequencing are allowing metagenomic analysis of soil and plant microbiomes which also demonstrates the limitations of culturing methods. Issues like specificity between qPCR and culture based methods should be highlighted.&#x000a0;</p><p> Methods:&#x000a0;</p><p> Plant material - Nowhere in the methods section is any information provided about the cannabis plant material. Was it cannabis flowers? Were they dried? Was the sample homogenized in anyway?&#x000a0;</p><p> Information about all the samples used in this study should be summarized in a table or in a section within the methods part of the manuscript.&#x000a0;</p><p> Results:&#x000a0;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Table 1- This table highlights one of the main criticisms I have with this study. There are no replicates. These results seem to be based off a single analysis of each sample. Therefore we can't conclude anything about the reproducibility of the qPCR platform compared to the other platforms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is also interesting to note that most of the culture based methods detected levels of fungi that would be considered failures while most of the qPCR samples detected only low levels of fungal DNA.&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is difficult to follow from reading through the text of the manuscript which samples were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. Every sample analyzed by metagenomic&#x000a0;sequencing and a summary of their results, in terms of what species were detected and their approximate amounts, should be summarized somewhere in the manuscript for ease of reference and completeness of data presentation. Why those samples were chosen should be discussed.&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Throughout the results section numbers of samples are discussed but we don't know if those are the same samples or which samples shown in Table 1.</p><p> For example page 7 paragraph 2:</p><p> "First, we observed that although&#x000a0;
<italic>Aspergillus</italic>&#x000a0;species were present in 15 plant samples (average proportion: 25% of classified reads), they were only detected at low levels in three samples after culturing on either 3M or BMX media (average proportion: 1.1% or 0.4% of classified reads, respectively).".</p><p> Which&#x000a0;15 plant samples? This kind of vague reference to samples needs to be corrected and be made more clear.&#x000a0;</p><p> Page 6, sequence reproducibility:</p><p> "14 samples".</p><p> Which samples?&#x000a0;</p><p> Page 6, paragraph 4:</p><p> "Pairs of samples from three of the seven growers....".</p><p> Which&#x000a0;detected fungi were commonly found and correlated?&#x000a0;</p><p> Page 7, Figure 1:</p><p> Why just discuss 2 and 14? Why not 7-13 or 15-16?&#x000a0;</p></list-item></list>
</p><p> To summarize I would like to see more error bars (or +-) from replicates and more complete summaries of data and samples information.&#x000a0;</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="report16862" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5256/f1000research.10411.r16862</article-id><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Russo</surname><given-names>Ethan</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="r16862a1">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r16862a1">
