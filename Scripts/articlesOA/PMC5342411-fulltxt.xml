The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial step in cancer invasion and metastasis. However, it is still unclear of the molecular mechanism. In this study, the expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and atypical protein kinase C-&#x003b9; (aPKC-&#x003b9;) was further detected in CCA tissues and cell lines. Meanwhile, we established the EMT model of CCA cells and investigated 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; co-regulatory effect on the EMT <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, we identified the downstream molecular glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3&#x003b2;)/Snail signalling pathway that contribute to regulating the EMT. Our data showed that the expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; was synergistically increased in CCA tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and was intimately associated with differentiation and the tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that high 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; expression separately predicted a poor prognosis and were independent prognostic indicators in patients with CCA. The CO-IP experiment confirmed that the mutual binding relationship between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9;. Small interfering RNAs and siRNA rescue experiment demonstrated that 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; regulated each other. In addition, 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; pretreatment by si-RNA inhibit the phosphorylated GSK-3&#x003b2; and Snail expression during EMT. Meanwhile, silence of 14-3-3&#x003b6; or aPKC-&#x003b9; suppressed CCA cells migration, metastasis and proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study demonstrates that 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; synergistically facilitate EMT of CCA via GSK-3&#x003b2;/Snail signalling pathway, and may be potential therapeutic target for CCA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cholangiocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>epithelial-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>synergy</kwd><kwd>transfection</kwd><kwd>silencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an epithelial cell malignancy deriving from the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The incidence of CCA has been increasing annually in China [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], however, most CCA patients are notoriously difficult to diagnose and have poor prognosis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, radical resection is the only effective treatment, with the 5-year survival rate after R0 resection ranging from 20% to 40%[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the rate of postoperative recurrence up to 75%[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The reason is that CCA cells possess a strong propensity to invade and metastasize to adjacent organs. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis remain elusive.</p><p>Epithelial carcinoma cells shed themselves of cell-cell junctions and migrate to a distal site where they recolonize via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The EMT has been shown to be a pivotal mechanism contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During the processes of EMT, epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire the migratory properties of mesenchymal cells [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], including the down-regulating of E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin, and the up-regulation of N-cadherin and vimentin. Transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, ZEB1 and Twist, have been implicated in the control of EMT. Snail is a zinc finger transcription factor which has been established as a key EMT regulator [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Snail and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3&#x003b2;) together function as a molecular switch for many signaling pathways that strongly repress E-cadherin expression [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, EMT is mediated by a complex network of signaling pathways. In this network, atypical protein kinase C-iota (aPKC-&#x003b9;), one of polarization regulatory proteins, acts as a central hub [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is well-known that aPKC-&#x003b9; plays an essential role in controlling the organization of E-cadherin in different cell types [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our previous studies also showed that the synergistic expression of aPKC-&#x003b9; and E-cadherin may reflect the differentiation and invasive potential of CCA and aPKC-&#x003b9; may play an important role in inducing EMT [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent study found that aPKC-&#x003b9; can directly phosphorylate GSK-3&#x003b2; and lead to defects in apical-basal polarity [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interesting, the activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; is mainly regulated by its Ser9 phosphorylation, and 14-3-3&#x003b6; enhances Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; by PKC [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>14-3-3&#x003b6; has been proposed to be directly involved in cellular transformation and proliferation [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and associated with prognosis of cancers [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A striking feature of 14-3-3 proteins is that they are able to bind to many signaling molecules and have therefore been implicated in a wide array of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, migration, and the EMT [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Studies have indicated that 14-3-3&#x003b6; is overexpressed in CCA [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and that up-regulation of 14-3-3&#x003b6; contributes to resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis and increases the potential for invasion and metastasis by facilitating EMT [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, 14-3-3&#x003b6; has the potential to serve as a molecular target for cancer therapy [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the mutual relationship between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; in CCA are unclear. On the basis of previous works, we further detected the expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; in CCA tissues, examined the interaction between them in CCA cells, investigated the regulation of EMT by them <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with an attempt to explore the mechanism of EMT.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Co-overexpression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; promotes tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis in CCA patients</title><p>Initially, the expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6;, aPKC-&#x003b9; and E-cadherin in 64 paired CCA and peritumoral tissue samples and 10 choledochocyst samples as controls was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB), meanwhile the patients&#x02019; samples were histopathologically evaluated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In the early stages of the metastasis cascade, EMT is a critical process [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, while substantial progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer has been made, we still lack sufficient insight into the mechanisms of EMT in patients with CCA. EMT can be induced by various signaling pathways and regulatory networks that, in many cases, overlap with developmental processes that are hijacked by cancer cells [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a central hub in EMT, aPKC-&#x003b9; is essential for the migration and invasion of multiple cancer cell lines and contributes to TGF-&#x003b2;-induced EMT [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our previous study suggested that aPKC-&#x003b9; is also involved in the EMT in CCA cells [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Meanwhile, 14-3-3&#x003b6; is ubiquitous in all eukaryocyte and acts as a central hub regulating many pathways involved in cellular transformation common to various cancers [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Over expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; can increase the potential for invasion and metastasis by facilitating EMT [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, the reports on the association of 14-3-3&#x003b6; with aPKC-&#x003b9; in CCA are scarce.</p><p>Based on our previous studies, we enrolled the 64 consecutive patients with CCA, and further detected the co-expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6;, aPKC-&#x003b9; and E-cadherin by IHC, qRT-PCR and WB. The results revealed that in contrast to E-cadherin low expression, 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; were co-overexpression in CCA tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, 1B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and there was a positive correlation between them (&#x003b3;=0.406, <italic>P</italic>=0.001). Moreover, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis indicated that overexpression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation (14-3-3&#x003b6;: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=9.722, <italic>P</italic>=0.002; aPKC-&#x003b9;: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=9.329, <italic>P</italic>=0.002) and advanced CCA TNM stage (14-3-3&#x003b6;: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=10.136, <italic>P</italic>=0.001; aPKC-&#x003b9;: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=13.856, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Therefor, CCA patients with high 14-3-3&#x003b6; or aPKC-&#x003b9; expression had worse prognoses compared with those counterparts with low 14-3-3&#x003b6; or aPKC-&#x003b9; expression (14-3-3&#x003b6;: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> =10.140, <italic>P</italic>= 0.001; aPKC-&#x003b9;: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> =12.575, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The multivariate analysis showed that the expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; was an independent and significant risk factor for survival after curative resection (<italic>P</italic>=0.026; <italic>P</italic>=0.025, respectively) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These clinical observations strongly suggested that 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; were oncogenes in CCA, and 14-3-3&#x003b6; expression was coupled with aPKC-&#x003b9; expression to achieve a synergistic effect, and they may serve as useful prognostic biomarkers. Notably particularly, we found that superabundance of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; were associated with a deficiency of E-cadherin in 64 CCA tissue samples(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, 1B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These results indicated that 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; synergistically facilitate the progress of CCA via EMT.</p><p>This idea was further supported by protein and gene expression analyses, including CO-IP and step-by-step interference <italic>in vitro</italic>. CO-IP assay revealed that 14-3-3&#x003b6; could bind to aPKC-&#x003b9; in CCA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Furthermore, 14-3-3&#x003b6; or aPKC-&#x003b9; knockdown with siRNA was associated with correspondingly down-regulated expression of both aPKC-&#x003b9; and 14-3-3&#x003b6; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). And then, in aPKC-&#x003b9;-siRNA rescue experiment, the expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; was up-regulated accompanying with elevated aPKC-&#x003b9; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Our studies recommended that 14-3-3&#x003b6; forms a complex with aPKC-&#x003b9;, and they regulate each other in CCA cells. 14-3-3&#x003b6; is a dimeric protein and forms a flattened horseshoe structure containing two grooves that can modulate binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs on its target proteins [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Dimerization and target binding are dependent on the phosphorylation of 14-3-3&#x003b6;. Two prototype 14-3-3&#x003b6; binding motifs are RSXpSXP and RXY/FXXpSXP, where pS represents phosphoserine and X any amino acid [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Three phosphorylation sites on 14-3-3&#x003b6; (Ser58, Ser184 and Thr232) have been identified. 14-3-3&#x003b6; regulates its target proteins through a number of mechanisms including: changing the conformation of the protein, affecting protein activity or stability, facilitating protein complex formation, or altering protein subcellular localization [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Phosphorylation of 14-3-3&#x003b6; at Ser184 residue converts 14-3-3&#x003b6; to 14-3-3&#x003c3;, and enhances its interaction with PKC <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. aPKC-&#x003b9; is also a serine/threonine kinase, and the N-terminal of aPKC-&#x003b9; contains a conserved regulatory region-PB1 (Phox-Bem1) area which is rich in cysteine sequence [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. aPKC-&#x003b9; can be activated through specific protein-protein interactions mediated by a Phox-Bem1 (PB1) domain within the N-terminal regulatory domain [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the PB1 area plays a crucial role in aPKC-&#x003b9; promoting cell polarization, proliferation, survival, transformation and other biological activities [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The phosphorylation sites include Ser217, Ser237/Ser238, and Ser35/Ser37 [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the further study, we investigated the activated forms p-14-3-3&#x003b6; and p-aPKC-&#x003b9;. Similarly, both p-14-3-3&#x003b6; and p-aPKC-&#x003b9; expression were inhibited by siRNA, and p-14-3-3&#x003b6; expression was recovered in the aPKC-&#x003b9;-siRNA rescue experiment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In combination of our research, we hypothesized that 14-3-3&#x003b6; bind to the PB1 area of aPKC-&#x003b9; through phosphorylation site, and activate the functions of aPKC-&#x003b9;. However, the specific phosphorylation sites were still under further study.</p><p>Meanwhile, our data provided a novel concept that a positive regulatory loop exists between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9;. However, it is worth to note that the loop remains largely unknown. The potential mechanisms could include: (1) Phosphorylation of 14-3-3&#x003b6; at Ser184 residue converts 14-3-3&#x003b6; to 14-3-3&#x003c3;, and enhances its interaction with aPKC-&#x003b9; <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. (2) 14-3-3&#x003b6; protein forms stable homolo- or hetero-dimers structure, and feedback regulates 14-3-3&#x003b6; dimerization or expression alter the balance of 14-3-3&#x003b6; dimers [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. (3) aPKC-&#x003b9; activates MAPK signaling pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPAKPK2) phosphorylates the Ser58 residue on 14-3-3&#x003b6; to disrupt binding by altering 14-3-3&#x003b6; dimerization [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. (4) 14-3-3&#x003b6; is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-375, leading to down regulation of both 14-3-3&#x003b6; mRNA and protein [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; (5) The sub-cellular localization of 14-3-3&#x003b6; directs or limits interacting protein [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Activated 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; synergistically facilitate the progress of CCA via EMT. For insight into the molecular regulation of EMT, the TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced EMT model was successfully established and the changes in EMT markers were consistent with those described in the literature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Subsequently, silencing of 14-3-3&#x003b6; or aPKC-&#x003b9; prevented alterations in the EMT markers from occurring after TGF-&#x003b2; induction (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Moreover, Snail, as the most important nuclear transcription factor in EMT, was decreased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Meanwhile, p-GSK-3&#x003b2;, one of the upstream regulatory molecules of Snail, was significantly decreased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). However, in an aPKC-&#x003b9;-siRNA rescue experiment, the conversion of EMT markers was recovered (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and both expression of Snail and p-GSK-3&#x003b2; were increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). A large number of studies have demonstrated that the nuclear transcription factor Snail inhibits the expression of E-cadherin [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and is closely associated with cancer metastasis via EMT [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, Snail is degraded by proteasome after GSK-3&#x003b2;-dependent phosphorylation [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The suppression of GSK-3&#x003b2; through phosphorylation of Ser 9 promotes Snail to be much more stable and reside exclusively in the nucleus to induce EMT. In fact, Snail and GSK-3&#x003b2; together function as a molecular switch for many signaling pathways that lead to EMT [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In summary, 14-3-3&#x003b6; binds to aPKC-&#x003b9; and activate aPKC-&#x003b9; through phosphorylation, and activation of aPKC-&#x003b9; lead to the suppression of GSK-3&#x003b2; through phosphorylation of Ser 9, and furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; results in the upregulation of Snail and downregulation of E-cadherin, and promotes the EMT ultimately in CCA cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).</p><p>EMT endows malignant cells with migration and invasion [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. So, invasion, migration and proliferation of CCA cells were investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and the subcutaneous tumor model and the pulmonary metastasis tumor model were established <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). After silencing of 14-3-3&#x003b6; significantly inhibited the tumor development, growth, invasion and metastasis of CCA cells. These data show that 14-3-3&#x003b6; promotes the EMT of CCA cells and that the silencing of 14-3-3&#x003b6; suppresses EMT-induced invasion and tumor metastasis. Therefore, directly targeting 14-3-3&#x003b6; may be a viable approach for anti-cancer therapy.</p><p>To sum up, our study demonstrates that 14-3-3&#x003b6; and aPKC-&#x003b9; synergistically facilitate the progression of CCA and are independent factors on the survival prognosis. 14-3-3&#x003b6; binds to aPKC-&#x003b9; through phosphorylation site, and activate the functions of aPKC-&#x003b9;. Activation of aPKC-&#x003b9; lead to the suppression of GSK-3&#x003b2; through phosphorylation, and inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; results in the upregulation of Snail and downregulation of E-cadherin, and promotes the EMT. Silencing of 14-3-3&#x003b6; suppresses EMT-induced invasion and metastasis. Our results suggest that 14-3-3&#x003b6; may be used as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in patients with CCA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients and clinicopathological data</title><p>From January 2008 to June 2013, 64 consecutive patients underwent resection of cholangiocarcinoma at the Department of Biliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).
