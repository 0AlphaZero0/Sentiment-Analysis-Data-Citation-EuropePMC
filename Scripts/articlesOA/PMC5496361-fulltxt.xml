The DSS output suggested stimulation pads and parameters based on muscle twitch responses to short stimulus trains. The DSS ranked combinations of pads and current amplitudes based on a novel measurement of the quality of the induced movement and classified them based on the movement direction (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion and inversion) of the paretic foot. The efficacy of the DSS in providing satisfactory pad-current amplitude choices for shaping the stimulation electrode was evaluated by trained clinicians. The range of paretic foot motion was used as a quality indicator for the chosen patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The results suggest that the DSS output was highly effective in creating optimized FES patterns. The position and number of pads included showed pronounced inter-patient and inter-session variability; however, zones for inducing dorsiflexion and plantar flexion within the multi-pad electrode were clearly separated.

It is commonly caused by stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To avoid foot dragging during the swing phase of the gait, patients with foot drop adopt abnormal gait patterns characterized by hip hitching, circumduction and toe catch. These distortions of the gait pattern lead to a decrease in the gait velocity and walking endurance, longer stance and double support gait phases, an increased energy cost, instability and a tendency to trip and fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an active approach for treating foot drop. It is a technique that relies on the production of short bursts of electrical pulses to induce contraction by eliciting an action potential in the motor neurons that innervate a muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. FES principles can be employed for the therapeutic treatment of foot drop and/or in the form of an active assistive orthotic device for daily use and the long-term replacement of the impaired motor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. FES-based therapeutic and assistive devices for foot drop correction typically stimulate the common peroneal nerve in the swing phase of the gait to ensure foot lifting, i.e., the dorsiflexion (DF) of the ankle (for a review, see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Moreover, producing plantar flexion (PF) with FES during the pre-swing phase of the gait results in better knee flexion, which also facilitates the swing phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The most common challenges in foot drop FES applications are determining motor points, i.e., adequately positioning the electrodes, setting stimulation parameters that produce comfortable foot lift without unnatural foot eversion or inversion, and increased muscle fatigue from electrically induced contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Currently available commercial systems stimulate dorsiflexion only; they do not compensate for eversion (EV) or inversion (IV) and do not support push-off due to the complexity of proper electrode positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">One of the options for overcoming these issues is the use of multi-pad surface electrodes. Multi-pad electrodes comprise many relatively small stimulation pads. Each pad can be activated separately or as a part of a stimulation pattern, i.e., a set of individual pads that are associated with different parameters, including the pulse width and amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Multi-pad systems aim to improve the selectivity of stimulation and provide easier and faster electrode donning and doffing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">However, many pads increase the number of possible combinations for stimulation electrode shaping. Defining the stimulation patterns can be time consuming and laborious and requires medical training and knowledge of neurophysiology and anatomy. Therefore, novel FES systems may benefit greatly from an automated stimulation electrode shaping process that does not rely on precise or finely reproducible electrode positioning. Such an automated process can reduce the clinicians&#x02019; time and effort in therapeutic applications of FES and increase the users&#x02019; independence in terms of the everyday use of a FES system in assistive applications.</p><p id="Par39">Several groups have investigated the design of multi-pad stimulation systems and control algorithms for the automatic shaping of stimulation patterns/electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Elsaify presented a proof of concept for using muscle twitches for the selection of stimulation patterns for DF induction using multiple individual electrodes positioned over the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and an inertial sensor on the foot for recording the twitch responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Heller et al. described the principle of searching for an optimal 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;4 pad electrode within an 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;8 pad cathode placed over the peroneal nerve, with a common anode over the TA muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More recently, Valtin et al. described a FES system for foot drop with the control of DF and EV during the swing phase of the gait by two decoupled iterative learning controllers. They employed two automatically tuned multi-pad electrodes, one over the TA muscle and the other over the area of the peroneal nerve. Foot movements were monitored with 2 inertial measurement units at the shank and foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a recent publication, Kenney et al. described a ShefStim device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] array-based FES system for the correction of foot drop that comprises a three-phase search algorithm for finding an appropriate candidate out of 25 stimulation patterns within a multi-pad array. Prenton et al. tested the automatic algorithm for stimulation pattern selection described by Kenney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for unsupervised use by individuals with foot drop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Although FES-induced ankle DF can correct foot drop, it also decreases knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion at the toe-off in the swing phase of the gait, which decreases the propulsive force generated during the transition from the stance phase to the swing phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which in turn implies a need for more complex stimulation patterns in systems for FES-assisted gait, including the support of movements other than DF. To the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available multi-pad FES systems for foot drop treatment support the induction of both DF and PF movement. An assistive benefit of introducing electrically induced PF during FES-assisted walking is the enhancement of the propulsive force during the push-off phase. In addition to assistive effects, the therapeutic effects of FES that presumably arise through the facilitation of neural plasticity by increasing the strength of afferent inputs are also important to consider when designing a closed-loop FES system. In particular, an FES system in which the timing of the electrical input that creates the afferent feedback is synchronized with the electrophysiological correlate of voluntary movement (i.e., EMG or a position sensor) has been shown to facilitate neural plasticity (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). Therefore, creating a natural, temporally precise sequence of phases (i.e., a FES-induced DF in the swing phase and a PF in the push-off phase of the gait) during FES-assisted walking therapy may further enhance motor recovery via the synchronization of sensory and motor information.</p><p id="Par41">Our goal was to clinically test a novel foot drop device supporting the induction of both DF and PF movements. Because the system was based on multi-pad technology, we introduced and described a dedicated decision support system (DSS) to facilitate the process of defining the stimulation patterns for inducing ankle DF and PF movements. The novel foot drop device that was the focus of this study comprised a custom-designed multi-pad electrode, an electrical stimulator, and a single inertial sensor (Fesia Walk, Tecnalia R&#x00026;I, Donostia/San Sebasti&#x000e1;n, Spain). The novelty of the applied methodology lies in the multi-pad electrode design and positioning, covering the branches of peroneal and tibial nerves for supporting both DF and PF and a dedicated DSS for easier shaping of the DF and PF stimulation patterns.</p><p id="Par42">An additional goal was the clinical evaluation of the performance of the DSS for the automatic identification of high-quality pads for further electrode shaping. A qualitative assessment of the DSS output was conducted by comparing the pads suggested by the DSS with the pads selected by trained rehabilitation specialists. Moreover, we analyzed the variability of pads included in the DF/PF stimulation patterns during 20 daily sessions in 10 stroke patients. We also tracked the changes in the patients&#x02019; active and FES-induced ankle range of motion to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the proposed FES methodology for inducing good-quality movement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par43">Ten hemiplegic patients (6 male and 4 female, aged 47&#x02013;68&#x000a0;years.) with foot drop caused by stroke participated in this study.

The Fesia Walk stimulator delivered a train of biphasic pulses of various widths and amplitudes to a demultiplexer, which routed them to different conductive pads of the electrode in an asynchronous manner. This operating principle (i.e., the surface-distributed low-frequency asynchronous stimulation - sDLFAS) has been investigated in our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

This design enabled the coverage of two regions of interest for producing PF and DF, one over the tibial nerve and the other over the common peroneal nerve, targeting the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, peroneus, and soleus muscles. The pads were covered with an adhesive conductive gel to achieve an adequate skin-electrode interface (AG735, Axelgaard, Inc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]).

The DSS output provided four suggested pad-amplitude combinations for each of the four movements. The pad-amplitude suggestions for each movement group were ranked based on a newly introduced quantitative measurement of the quality of the induced movement designated the Q factor. Four quality ranks, Q1-Q4, were defined, where Q1 indicated the best quality. For example, Q1(DF) was the pad-amplitude combination with the highest estimated quality of the four suggestions for inducing a DF movement.</p><p id="Par48">Shaping an optimal stimulation electrode implies the necessity to evaluate the movement generated by each possible pad-amplitude combination. We designed a twitch protocol for this purpose, and the muscle twitches elicited in response to a short stimulation pulse train were classified into groups of different movement types (in this case, four groups - DF, PF, EV, and IV). The twitches were recorded with the IMU in the form of angular velocity signals in the sagittal and transverse planes. Each electrode pad was activated by 3 trains of stimulation pulses with pulse amplitudes that increased in 1&#x000a0;mA steps. Stimulus trains consisted of seven pulses with a frequency of 40&#x000a0;Hz and a pulse width of 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s (total train duration: 150&#x000a0;ms). A relaxation period of 350&#x000a0;ms was allowed between 2 consecutive stimulus trains, and thus, the time window for registering a twitch response for one pad-amplitude combination was 500&#x000a0;ms. Consequently, 48 twitch responses (16 pads&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3 current amplitudes, 24&#x000a0;s duration were recorded) in each of the two planes.

They underwent 2&#x000a0;weeks of training to become familiar with the new multi-pad concept of stimulation as well as the use of the PC application for stimulation electrode shaping. The patterns were shaped via a user-friendly application on a touch-screen tablet PC. For better localization, the selected pads were highlighted in the electrode sketch displayed on the screen. In most cases, at least 2 clinicians were present during therapy, with one operating the stimulation system and the others supervising the process. The final DF/PF patterns were approved by all clinicians present.</p><p id="Par58">The clinicians were instructed to observe the foot responses during the twitch protocol and annotate the pads that induced satisfactory twitch responses in the DF and PF directions. The criterion for the DF or PF pad annotation was that the movement angle and direction were considered adequate for inclusion in the DF/PF stimulation patterns. The clinicians&#x02019; task was to annotate at least one useful pad per DF and PF directions during the twitch protocol. The pad locations and current amplitudes were displayed on the screen of the tablet PC during the twitch protocol so the clinicians could easily identify and write down their choice of pads for both movement directions. After the twitch protocol was completed, the clinicians proceeded with the final stimulation electrode shaping using the combined information of their annotated choices of satisfactory pads and the DSS output. The following abbreviations were introduced to improve readability:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par59">Clinicians&#x02019; choice of pads producing satisfactory movements during the twitch protocol for DF and PF were designated Set(DF)<sub>TW</sub> and Set(PF)<sub>TW</sub>, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par60">The sets of DF and PF pads suggested by the DSS were designated Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub> and Set(PF)<sub>DSS</sub>, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">The sets of pads included in the final DF and PF patterns shaped by the clinicians and used for FES-assisted walking were designated Set(DF)<sub>FIN</sub> and Set(PF)<sub>FIN</sub>, respectively.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par62">To explain the pattern-shaping process, we used the DF movement as an example, and the same set of rules was applied for PF. The first step was to determine the intersection between Set(DF)<sub>TW</sub> and Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub> and test the highest Q-rated pad-amplitude of the intersection with a 2-s tetanic FES contraction. When adding a new DF pad to the pattern, the pads that belonged to the Set(DF)<sub>TW</sub> and Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub> intersection were given priority, and the inclusion order was determined by the Q-rank (from the highest rank downward). If a pad had to be included and pads from the intersection were used/non-available, the remaining pads from the Set(DF)<sub>TW</sub> were considered for inclusion in a random order. The clinicians proceeded to search for an optimal combination using the remaining pads from Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub>, Set(EV)<sub>DSS</sub>, Set(IV)<sub>DSS</sub> or non-suggested pads only after all pads from the Set(DF)<sub>TW</sub> were tested. Therefore, the choice of pads shaping the electrode was primarily guided by the clinicians&#x02019; visual inspection of the twitch protocol and their choice of a satisfactory set of DF/PF pads. Only the order of pad inclusion in the final pattern was guided by the DSS output (i.e., was ordered by the Q-rank of the pads from the intersection of Set(DF/PF)<sub>TW</sub> and Set(DF/PF)<sub>DSS</sub>). Therefore, the selection bias introduced by the presence of the DSS output during the electrode shaping process is reflected mainly in the order of the pads tested, where the highest priority was assigned to the pads identified both by the clinicians and the DSS in descending order. However, if the clinicians&#x02019; choice of useful pads and the DSS output did not agree, the clinicians were instructed to first test their choices in random order before proceeding to the DSS-suggested pads and/or non-suggested pads to decrease the previously mentioned bias introduced by the DSS output.</p><p id="Par63">When a new pad was considered for inclusion in the pattern, its effect alone was checked as well as its contribution to the existing pattern. If the contribution of a newly considered pad was insufficient, it was omitted from the pattern. Furthermore, if a newly added pad provided better movement alone, the previously added pads were excluded from the pattern. The addition of a new pad to the pattern was based on the direction and amplitude of the resulting movements in the 2-s tetanic test, and the clinicians were guided by the following set of rules:</p><p id="Par64">I. If the direction and amplitude of the FES-induced movement were satisfactory, the current pattern was stored as the final pattern.</p><p id="Par65">II. If direction was satisfactory but amplitude was not, the first step was to increase the current intensity until the movement amplitude was adequate. If an increase of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mA did not provide adequate movement, a new pad was considered for electrode shaping.</p><p id="Par66">III. If direction was not satisfactory (i.e., an overly pronounced EV or IV was present), a new pad was considered. This could result in either the exclusion of the previous pads or the correction of the movement direction (by the contribution of a new pad to contrasting movement direction).</p><p id="Par67">This procedure was introduced as an expert evaluation tool of the DSS performance.</p><p id="Par68">At any moment, an unpleasant sensation reported by the patient led to a decrease in the current amplitude or the omission of the last-added pad. There were no limitations in the maximum number of pads, but only pads that contributed to the quality of the movement were included in the final patterns for DF and PF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Protocol</title><p id="Par70">The DSS testing was performed in the Clinic for Rehabilitation &#x002dd;Dr. Miroslav Zotovi&#x00107;&#x002dd; in Belgrade, Serbia. A clinician placed a garment with a multi-pad electrode and stimulation unit around the patient&#x02019;s knee and the IMU sensor on the foot. The multi-pad electrode was placed over the lateral and medial popliteal fossa, and the pad with the coordinates (2, 7) was positioned on the head of the fibula (shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Three (of four) neighboring pads of the multi-pad anode were selected according to the lower leg circumference such that the middle pad was positioned below the patella. All patients were seated during the tests. The healthy leg was fully extended without medial or lateral rotation and with the heel touching the ground and the foot in relaxed position. The paretic leg was positioned over the healthy one, crossing it at approximately knee level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>)). The paretic leg knee angle was approximately 160 degrees, and the foot hung freely.</p><p id="Par71">First, the active range of motion (ROMa) was recorded with the IMU. This task involved the patient independently lifting and lowering the paretic foot, guided by a prerecorded voice command sequence (voice command: &#x02018;Up&#x02019; at the beginning, &#x02018;Down&#x02019; after 5&#x000a0;s and a beep sound at the end of the sequence). The estimation of the foot range of motion (ROM) was performed under pseudo-static measurement conditions: the foot was stationary before the abrupt movements in DF and PF directions, with a relatively short transitions to the angle plateaus in which the foot was sustained. With this in mind, only the accelerometer signals were used to estimate the foot angles in static periods. The foot tilt angles were estimated based on the gravitational component of the acceleration and calculated as the arctangent of the ratio of the acceleration values in transverse and sagittal planes according to the method described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Estimation of the foot ROM relies on 3 plateaus: the first one was estimated before the reaction to the &#x002dd;Up&#x002dd; command, and the second and third were related to the maximal DF and PF, respectively. Finally, the foot ROM was calculated as the difference between the medians of the second and third plateaus.</p><p id="Par72">The next step in the setup procedure was to choose the current amplitude range (e.g., 20&#x02013;22&#x000a0;mA), followed by the twitch protocol. During the twitch protocol, if the patient reported that the pad-amplitude combination produced a painful sensation, it would be excluded from the DSS output. The automatic algorithm suggested pad-amplitude combinations for DF, PF, EV and IV, and the clinicians formed the final DF/PF patterns. The foot trajectories elicited by the electrical stimulation for calculating the stimulated ROM (ROMs) were acquired by activating the final DF pattern with a 5 s duration, followed by the activation of the final PF pattern for 7 s.&#x000a0;The ROMs was calculated in the same manner as for the ROMa. The ROMs was used as an objective indicator of quality of the pattern chosen.</p><p id="Par73">Each patient underwent the twitch protocol five times a week for four weeks and were supervised by the clinicians. The clinicians could overrule the suggested combinations. Following the setup process, which took up to 5&#x000a0;min, the patients received 30&#x000a0;min of FES-assisted walking therapy using the final selected stimulation pads and amplitudes. The frequency of the stimulation was set at 40 Hz and pulse width at 400 &#x003bc;s during the entire setup process as well as during the FES-assisted gait.</p><p id="Par74">The triggering of the stimulation during the FES-assisted gait was automated. The final patterns were stored in the stimulator memory, and the triggering of the stimulation was independent of the tablet PC. The detection of the gait phases was based on the signal in the sagittal plane from the IMU gyroscope. The pattern for PF was activated in the push-off phase, right after the initial heel lifting. Before the toes lifted, the pattern for PF was deactivated, and the pattern for DF was activated because a muscle contraction is delayed after the onset of stimulation. The DF pattern was active during the entire swing phase of the gait. Thus, firm foot lowering (heel contact &#x02013; toes contact) could occur, and the stimulation was turned off after the heel contact and forward propagation of the body. The outcomes of the FES-assisted gait therapy with the Fesia Walk system are not discussed in this manuscript except to demonstrate that there was an improvement in the ankle ROM over time using the FES-assisted gait therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par75">Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the following effects:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par76">The differences between ROMa and ROMs within the same session (intra-session ROM differences) and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">The differences in ROMa or ROMs over time, i.e., over different sessions (inter-session ROM differences)</p></list-item></list>

The majority of the selected pads were concentrated in the 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 pad sections, which corresponded to a 5.70&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3.70&#x000a0;cm area. When derived for individual patients, the global mean pads were all distributed within 1.6 pad sizes or 2.72 cm for DF and 1.3 pad sizes or 2.21 cm for PF, indicating relatively little inter-patient variability of the optimal stimulation areas for DF and PF induction. This grouping is in accordance with the underlying anatomy. The majority of the pads included in Set(PF)<sub>FIN</sub> were located in the half of the electrode positioned over the medial popliteal area and targeted the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve (i.e., the left half of the electrode in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The majority of pads included in Set(DF)<sub>FIN</sub> were in the half of the electrode that targeted the common peroneal nerve, passing through the lateral aspect of the popliteal fossa (i.e., the right half of the electrode in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">Another important outcome of this study is the analysis of the inter-session variability of pads included in Set(DF)<sub>FIN</sub> and Set(PF)<sub>FIN</sub> for each patient. The possible sources of the observed effect may be attributed to slight differences in garment donning from session to session, changes in skin-electrode impedance and/or differences in the shank circumference due to swelling or changes in tissue hydration. All sources of variability listed cannot be avoided in realistic clinical or daily life applications. These results support the necessity of employing multi-pad electrodes. Their major advantage over conventional electrodes is the ability to shape the stimulation area in an optimal manner without precise positioning, as the group of pads covers a larger area of interest, which could also indicate why commercially available foot drop systems with a single pair of electrodes are not able to provide reliable ankle dorsiflexion at all times.</p><p id="Par95">Our methodology was aimed at producing an adaptable stimulation pattern shape while retaining relatively small individual pad areas that provided increased selectivity of stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, a group of smaller pads within the array increases the number of the possible combinations for designing a stimulation pattern. Testing all of these combinations is time consuming and exhausting for both clients and clinicians, which leads to the need for a fully automated algorithm; the DSS described in this study is the first step toward such a goal. The fact that the final pads included formed two spatially distinct areas provides an opportunity to preselect certain pads for DF and PF and further reduce the search-zone per movement type. The results presented in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> indicate that 5 different pads were most frequently identified for DF electrode shaping, and those pads were used in more than 50% of the sessions (&#x0003e;10) in 6 patients. For PF electrode shaping, 6 different pads were most frequently identified, and the most frequent pads were used in 50% sessions or more only in 2 patients. This result further confirms the variability of optimal stimulation hotspots within the DF and PF zones and suggests that an additional closed-loop motion-analysis-based refinement is necessary as a part of an automatic algorithm for electrode shaping.</p><p id="Par96">The combined effect of the activation of several pads was not systematically evaluated during the clinical study presented here. However, in our previous studies, we examined certain effects related to an asynchronous multi-pad FES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The important factor that affects the summation effect was the choice of stimulation parameters. We selected a relatively high stimulation frequency (40&#x000a0;Hz) coupled with a short inter-pulse interval (IPI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;ms) to produce a responsive and strong muscle contraction suitable for walking (i.e., a strong push-off and fast foot clearance in the swing phase). The asynchronous FES regime implies that the burst of number (N) of consecutive pulses is routed to N pads. Therefore, an IPI value of 1&#x000a0;ms is the interval between the activation of consecutive pads within the multi-pad-shaped electrode. The 40&#x000a0;Hz stimulation frequency implies that the interval between the pulses sent to the same pad within the shaped electrode is 1/40&#x000a0;s (25&#x000a0;ms). A short IPI was selected to fit all the stimulation pulses in the nerve refractory period, preventing the consecutive activation of the same muscle fibers by stimulation pulses delivered to different electrode pads, thus reducing muscle fatigue, which occurs more rapidly from stimulation with high frequencies. This setup also affects the summation effect of a stimulation electrode that comprises several pads during asynchronous multi-pad stimulation. Due to the short IPI, a stimulus routed to a pad will only activate muscle fibers that were not activated by preceding stimuli, which means that the muscle force resulting from a combination of pads could not be exactly estimated after the single pad activations during the twitch protocol. Nevertheless, activating a combination of several pads from the same group (e.g., for DF) always produced movement in the selected direction, proving that there was no electrical current superposition that could lead to the activation of nerves not activated during twitch protocol.</p><p id="Par97">Prenton et al. reported that a take-home array-based functional electrical stimulation system with automated setup is feasible for patients with foot drop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the efficacy of this algorithm for producing satisfactory movement was not reported. The cathode positioning and anode placement over the tibialis muscle in this design were intended solely for DF and EV/IV control and prevented the induction of PF movement. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first to support both DF and PF movements. The system enables the control of DF in the swing phase and PF in the push-off phase during FES-assisted walking using a single custom-designed multi-pad electrode and a single IMU.</p><p id="Par98">A seated position was selected for the patient during the twitch protocol and electrode shaping process, as it was the safest and most comfortable and allowed for a minimally obstructed range of both DF and PF. Moreover, the position of the stimulated structures of the paretic leg during the twitch protocol was similar to that in which the DF and PF stimulation electrodes are triggered during the FES-assisted gait cycle. This was important for the successful translation of the DF and PF electrodes from the static condition during the twitch protocol to a dynamic condition during FES-assisted walking without the introduction of changes due to the relative displacement of the stimulated structures (i.e., underlying nerve branches and tissue) caused by a change in position from seated to standing. The adhesive properties of the electrode hydrogel ensured stable contact between the skin and electrode, and the electrode garment also secured the electrode position by fixing it to the stimulation site.</p><p id="Par99">Although variability of the optimal stimulation sites for daily sessions was observed and reported in other publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this effect was never systematically evaluated. Furthermore, this study is the first to use an automated, quantitative assessment of the stimulated ROM to validate a qualitative pattern assessment performed by the clinicians. In more than 95% of cases, the clinicians were satisfied with the effect of the top-ranked pad activations. To further strengthen and accelerate muscle contraction and/or to produce ankle flexion with pronounced eversion, which is a desirable movement during rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the clinicians introduced additional pads to the proposed stimulation patterns until the foot movement was considered adequate. The results also demonstrate that in 82% and 89% of all sessions, the clinicians included only the pads suggested by the DSS; i.e., the Set(DF)<sub>FIN</sub> and Set(PF)<sub>FIN</sub> were subsets of Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub> and Set(PF)<sub>DSS</sub>, respectively. This result indicates that the pads suggested by the automatic algorithm were typically sufficient for creating good-quality stimulation patterns for both movements. Moreover, Set(DF)<sub>FIN</sub>/Set(PF)<sub>FIN</sub> were subsets of Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub>/Set(PF)<sub>DSS</sub> plus Set(EV)<sub>DSS</sub>/Set(IV)<sub>DSS</sub> in both movements for 98.5% of the trials. These results demonstrate that the DSS was successful in offering adequate choices for the construction of stimulation patterns for DF and PF movements, thus reducing the number of possible choices and facilitating the decision-making process of pad selection, which was the main purpose of the DSS presented in this study.</p><p id="Par100">The quality of the chosen patterns was validated by the response of the shank muscle activations with electrical stimulation (ROMs). Quantitative validation of the final selected stimulation patterns indicated that they did indeed produce the desired movements. Aside from the ROMs, we tracked the ability of a person to voluntarily flex and extend their ankle (ROMa). We observed an assistive effect and a therapeutic effect of foot drop walking therapy with the selected patterns. The assistive effect (i.e., a ROMs that is significantly greater than ROMa, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) was present with the first use of the system, but it decreased in later stages of therapy due to the therapeutic effect on the foot ROMa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Compared to baseline, ROMa increased significantly starting after one week of therapy (session 6, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0026), even though more than 3&#x000a0;months had passed since the occurrence of stroke. ROMs showed a statistically significant increase at the end of the study compared to the baseline, possibly due to an increase in muscle strength and a reduction in spasticity (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0026). The median value of the ROMs for all patients in the last session was 42 [Q1&#x02013;Q3: 36&#x02013;48]&#x000b0;, whereas it was 28 [Q1&#x02013;Q3: 21&#x02013;36]&#x000b0; in the first session. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether the therapeutic effects persist during a follow-up period. The fact that the stimulated ROM across the majority of sessions was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) than the matching voluntary ROM demonstrates that the assistive potential of this type of stimulation remains observable regardless of a patient&#x02019;s individual recovery pattern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par101">We have described a new DSS for finding an optimal set of pads to produce both DF and PF movements. We demonstrated that a single custom-designed multi-pad electrode can selectively induce both DF and PF movements. The control of both DF and PF movements and the stimulation hotspots differed from all previously reported methodologies used for foot drop correction. The pronounced session-to-session variability of the stimulation patterns emphasizes the advantages of multi-pad electrodes and the need for automation to facilitate stimulation pattern design. The semi-automatic procedure of statistical analysis of Q-ranked combinations&#x000a0;and inclusion data on the final patterns optimized by the clinicians can serve as an initial step in this direction. Future work will address the effectiveness of the gait therapy using the Fesia Walk system and the design of a fully automated electrode shaping algorithm.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AFO</term><def><p id="Par6">Ankle Foot Orthosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BBS</term><def><p id="Par7">The Berg Balance Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p id="Par8">The Barthel Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DF</term><def><p id="Par9">Dorsiflexion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSS</term><def><p id="Par10">Decision support system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EV</term><def><p id="Par11">Eversion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FES</term><def><p id="Par12">Functional electrical stimulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FM</term><def><p id="Par13">The Fugl-Meyer Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hemo</term><def><p id="Par14">Hemorrhagic stroke</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMU</term><def><p id="Par15">Inertial measurement unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Isch</term><def><p id="Par16">Ischemic stroke</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p id="Par17">Inversion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAS</term><def><p id="Par18">The Modified Ashworth Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MFP</term><def><p id="Par19">Most frequent pad</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>nP</term><def><p id="Par20">The number of patterns which contain MFP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PF</term><def><p id="Par21">Plantar flexion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QC</term><def><p id="Par22">Quad cane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROM</term><def><p id="Par23">Range of motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p id="Par24">Simple cane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDx</term><def><p id="Par25">Standard deviation of sessions mean pads in horizontal plane of the electrode</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDy</term><def><p id="Par26">Standard deviation of sessions mean pads in vertical plane of the electrode</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Set(DF)<sub>DSS</sub></term><def><p id="Par27">Set of pads suggested for DF by the DSS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Set(DF)<sub>FIN</sub></term><def><p id="Par28">Set of pads included in final pattern for DF by clinicians</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Set(DF)<sub>TW</sub></term><def><p id="Par29">Clinicians&#x02019; choice of pads producing satisfactory movements during the twitch protocol for DF</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Set(PF)<sub>DSS</sub></term><def><p id="Par30">Set of pads suggested for PF by the DSS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Set(PF)<sub>FIN</sub></term><def><p id="Par31">Set of pads included in final pattern for PF by clinicians</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Set(PF)<sub>TW</sub></term><def><p id="Par32">Clinicians&#x02019; choice of pads producing satisfactory movements during the twitch protocol for PF</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TC</term><def><p id="Par33">Three pod cane</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank An&#x00111;elka Pjanovi&#x00107;, P.T., Ivana Nikodijevi&#x00107;, P.T., Sadeta Kukuljac, P.T. and Ivan &#x00110;or&#x00111;evi&#x00107;, P.T., Clinic for Rehabilitation &#x0201c;Dr Miroslav Zotovi&#x00107;&#x0201d;, Belgrade, Serbia for significant help and assistance during clinical testing and therapy sessions.</p><p>For hardware development we acknowledge Prof Nikola Jorgovanovi&#x00107; and Prof Vojin Ili&#x00107;, Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia David Valencia (Elect.
