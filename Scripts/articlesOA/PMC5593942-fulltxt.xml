<italic>Rhodotorula mucilaginosa</italic> was isolated from a patient with onychomycosis, and identification was confirmed by morphological and cultural characteristics as well as by DNA molecular analysis. Antifungal agents naftifine (10&#x02009;mg/mL, active substance in Exoderil) and bifonazole (10&#x02009;mg/mL, active substance in Canespor) were tested in different concentrations to assess <italic>in vitro</italic> effects on fungal growth and carotenoid synthesis. The antifungal mechanisms of action of naftifine and bifonazole against <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> isolates were similar and affected the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol. For the first time, this research demonstrates that naftifine affects the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, producing depigmentation of <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> in solid and liquid media. Furthermore, depigmentation was a reversible process; naftifine-treated yeast cells that were depigmented resumed carotenoid production upon transfer to fresh media. Raman and UV-vis spectrophotometry in conjunction with chromatographic analysis detected changes in carotenoids in yeast cells, with torulene decreasing and B-carotene increasing after repigmentation. Transmission electron micrographs revealed critical ultrastructural modifications in the depigmented cells after naftifine treatment, i.e., a low-electron-density cell wall without visible mucilage or lamellate structure.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Onychomycosis is a multifactorial nail fungal infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It is an important public health problem because of its high prevalence, high rates of recurrence and progression to chronic lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Onychomycosis accounts for 50% of all nail diseases. It affects 2&#x02013;13% of the general population, and this percentage increases with age, reaching up to 40% in the elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thickened, discoloured, deformed nails without pain are the most common symptoms of a fungal nail infection. Although the clinical picture can be very suggestive, the diagnosis should be confirmed by a routine method before starting treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The most commonly used methods are direct potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination, culture, and, to a lesser extent, nail biopsy. The diagnosis of onychomycosis is made when one or more of the three diagnostic tests are positive. Other tests are expensive and require the use of specialized equipment and materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Common pathogens in onychomycosis are dermatophytes, nondermatophyte moulds (NDMs) and yeasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The nomenclature of fungal infections proposed by the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology suggests that the term onychomycosis should be replaced by tinea unguium when the aetiological agent is a dermatophyte; by onyxis when yeasts are the cause; by ungual candidiasis when the agent is <italic>Candida</italic>; and by ungual mycosis when the causal agent is an NDM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Most cases of tinea unguium are caused by dermatophytes that belong to three genera: <italic>Trichophyton</italic>, <italic>Microsporum</italic>, and <italic>Epidermophyton</italic>. The fungi <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>, <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>, and <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> are the most common aetiologic agents of onychomycosis worldwide. The most commonly described species of NDM are <italic>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</italic>, <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., <italic>Acremonium</italic> spp., <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., <italic>Scytalidium</italic> spp., and <italic>Onychocola canadienses</italic>

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and <italic>R. glutinis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

During the last few decades, they have emerged as opportunistic pathogens, particularly in immunocompromised patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Because onychomycosis aetiologic agents have variable susceptibility to antifungal drugs, laboratory diagnosis is a necessary tool for ascertaining the best therapeutic option<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Precise and correct identification of the species responsible for onychomycosis in a given patient is required to select the most appropriate treatment as well as to avoid the misuse of antifungals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility tests demonstrated that <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> is sensitive to low concentrations of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine and resistant to high concentrations of fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and terbinafine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, in the case of <italic>R. glutinis</italic>, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) vary depending on the antifungal drug: 0.125 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL for itraconazole; 0.5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL for amphotericin B, anidulafungin and posaconazole; 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL for voriconazole; 16 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL for caspofungin and 128 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL for fluconazole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

<italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> is a basidiomycetous yeast. It presents only spheroidal to oval budding cells (2.5&#x02013;6.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6.5&#x02013;14.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m) with carotenoid pigments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and without the rudimentary formation of hyphae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This species is characterized by yeast-like colonies that are coral pink and moist to mucoid on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA), by the inability to assimilate inositol and by the absence of fermentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Carotenoids can act as vitamin A precursors, having colouring and antioxidant properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Carotenoids are widely produced pigments found in algae, yeasts and plants. Their main functions are reactive oxygen species scavenging and protection against photooxidative damage. Four main pigments, torularhodin, torulene, beta-carotene and gamma-carotene, are synthesized by <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and carotenoid production is usually enhanced by stress factors such as UV exposure, oxidative stress or osmotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Torularhodin was shown to be correlated with the survival of the cells under UV-B light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Beta-carotene and torularhodin also showed antioxidant activity, preventing hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Carotenoid synthesis starts from acetyl-CoA that is transformed into isopentenyl pyrophosphate and further to lycopene, which is the source of many other carotenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Cases of depigmentation have previously been reported and are thought to be induced by chemicals interfering with the biosynthetic process. Naftifine, a topical allylamine, has been shown to interfere with the pigmentation process of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> colonies by specifically and strongly inhibiting isoprenoid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">The study aimed first to find onychomycosis etiology and sensitivity to naftifine and bifonazole.

</p><p id="Par11">Then, by exposing a control <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> isolate for 10&#x02009;minutes to 1&#x02009;mg/mL naftifine solution, depigmented fungal colonies were obtained on SDA control media. The depigmented colonies were mucoid and had similar diameters to the red colonies but showed a milky colour. Moreover, by including small concentrations of naftifine (0.1&#x02009;mg/mL, 0.2&#x02009;mg/mL) in SDA before inoculation of <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> isolate, an inhibitory effect was obtained compared to the control colonies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These depigmented colonies had a diameter of 7-8 mm on SDA with 0.1&#x02009;mg/mL naftifine and of 5-6 mm on SDA with 0.2&#x02009;mg/mL naftifine, showing a small dose-dependent inhibitory effect of the drug (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Furthermore, by inoculating depigmented <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> isolate into SDA control media, colonies regained pigment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Considering that carotenoids are important substances against reactive oxygen species (ROS), depigmentation may be correlated with increased oxidative stress and fungal injury. Repigmentation suggested that the carotenoid metabolism changes induced in the fungi by naftifine were reversible. These surprising results suggested further analysis regarding <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> carotenoid metabolism and related structural changes.</p><p id="Par12">Preliminary tests of <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> growth under our conditions indicated that the stationary phase was reached after 60&#x02013;70&#x02009;h. However, in the initial exponential stage the cells appeared mostly colourless (low carotenoid content), and only after approximately 50&#x02009;h could the pigmentation be observed. This monitoring was performed at various pH values (pH range 3.5&#x02013;7.5), especially for tracking carotenoid formation. The growth was pH-dependent only in the initial exponential phase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1A</xref>). Although the pH profile change in time was dependent on the initial pH (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1B</xref>), indicating a pH-dependent metabolism for <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic>, carotenoid formation in terms of both rate and composition did not depend on pH significantly, as observed by monitoring the intensity and spectral features from the resonant Raman spectra (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). We aimed to further understand the factors that influenced and controlled carotenoid formation in <italic>Rhodotorula</italic> spp. beyond the factors that interfered with basic metabolism, such as type of C and N sources and their ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, compounds inducing ROS stress (e.g., duroquinone, methylene blue). ROS upregulated carotenoid content in <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic>, indicating that the carotenoids were a response of the cells to the negative effects of ROS agents (e.g., superoxide, singlet oxygen) as previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Other chemicals, such as amphotericin and diphenylamine, not only inhibited carotenoid formation but also cell development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In addition, we hypothesized that the photosensitizers hypericin and hyperforin could also induce carotenoid formation; however, this was not the case (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), most likely due to the low level of the induced potential stress.</p><p id="Par13">During these initial experiments, we observed that one of the two tested antifungal agents, namely, naftifine (an allylamine antifungal drug), did not inhibit cell growth at lower concentrations, but rather induced depigmentation of the cells when growing on solid medium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The same results were obtained in liquid media, in controlled conditions. In addition to determination of naftifine MIC50 (55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14&#x02009;mg/L) for its antifungal activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), quantified by OD<sub>600nm,</sub> the effect of naftifine on depigmentation was assessed by OD<sub>512nm</sub> and a corresponding MIC50 (0.088&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02&#x02009;mg/L) was determined (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Depigmentation did not affect the cell growth at these naftifine concentrations, as could be observed by the optical density values.

</p><p id="Par15">Next, for more in-depth investigations, chromatographic analysis of the extracted carotenoids was performed. From a variety of solvents or conditions for cell disruption available in the literature, we chose simple DMSO treatment of the washed cells. The advantages of this procedure are the high yield of extraction (only a colourless pellet remained, indicating a quantitative extraction) and the good solubility of ergosterol in this solvent, which allowed a simultaneous extraction of both type of constituents. The High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis allowed the separation of four main carotenoids including torularhodin, torulene and &#x003b2;-carotene (C1, C2 and C3, respectively), in good agreement with previous data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), while the other compound (C<sub>nd</sub>) could not be identified. The identification was done using a pure standard for &#x003b2;-carotene and retention times, as well as using highly specific spectral features of the other two compounds, which were in very good agreement with already known data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The unidentified compound presented torulene-like carotenoid absorption spectral features and had a chromatographic behaviour (lower retention time allowing assignment as hydroxy-torulene) resembling previously detected carotenoids in other <italic>Rhodotorula</italic> spp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Additionally, ergosterol was also separated using the same method and identified based on its chromatographic and highly specific spectral characteristics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Moreover, using a dedicated method for ergosterol extraction, a highly similar spectrum was obtained. Therefore, all these related components could be quantitatively evaluated, allowing a comparative analysis for cells growing in different conditions. Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) was also used for carotenoid separation after DMSO removal using extraction cartridges. Using this method, the same three components were separated and identified, followed by their Raman detection directly on the plate. The contour map of the detected signal is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, and the individual Raman signals are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>. As expected, the spectra had a high degree of similarity due to highly similar chemical structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>); nevertheless, subtle changes could be observed at approximately 1280&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and a slight spectral shift appeared at 1505&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> band (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). In addition to torularhodin, torulene and &#x003b2;-carotene, two unidentified carotenoids were also observed (probably different than the one from HPLC analysis, due to retention time analysis). This may have occurred because in the introduction of an extra sample preparation step (cartridge extraction for DMSO removal), analyte alteration could occur, especially for those present in lower quantities.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HPLC-DAD chromatograms of the DMSO extracts of <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> (control, grown in the presence of 0.1&#x02009;mg/L naftifine and repigmented) as well as &#x003b2;-carotene standards.

</p><p id="Par16">A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the absorbance spectra of the DMSO extracts of the cells grown under various naftifine concentrations, and the plot of the scores corresponding to the first two principal components are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>. Surprisingly, two different clusters were noted, one with samples at low concentrations and one with samples at high concentrations, together with a transition zone. Such a grouping indicated different compositions of carotenoids with increasing naftifine concentration. To eliminate the concentration effect (decrease in intensity as the carotenoid content is diminished), for PCA analysis normalized spectra were used, thus allowing a qualitative-only analysis (relative content of carotenoids). The normalized spectra are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>. A shift of the spectral maxima towards the UV region was observed (the solutions are in DMSO, and thus the maxima were different from those in the HPLC data, where the solvent was different). This shifting of the maxima clearly indicates an increase of &#x003b2;-carotene relative content and decrease of torularhodin relative content as the naftifine concentration was increased. This was in very good agreement with the previously presented chromatographic results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Of note, the same approach applied to the bifonazole data did lead to different results. In this case, the decrease in the intensity of carotenoid spectra and increase in antifungal agent concentration were correlated solely with OD decrease (population size of the cells), and no change of the relative concentrations of the various carotenoids was observed. Therefore, the normalized spectra were identical over the entire bifonazole concentration range (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), and no clustering was observed when PCA analysis was applied to these spectra (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(<bold>A)</bold> Scatterplot of the first two principal component scores obtained after applying PCA to the UV-vis spectra of DMSO-disrupted <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> cell extract.

</p><p id="Par17">To further investigate the influence of naftifine upon carotenoid synthesis, we performed experiments where the total carotenoids were monitored by absorbance at 512&#x02009;nm after DMSO extraction from the cells and by OD<sub>600nm</sub> to evaluate the cell density (as a marker of cell survival). Contrary to our expectation, hypoxia and UV exposure alone led to depigmentation and had only a weak influence upon cell survival, while the addition of naftifine further suppressed the carotenoid content. Repigmentation of cells treated solely with naftifine (Ctrl.&#x02009;+&#x02009;naftifine) occurred after reinoculation in naftifine-free media (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>).

Strikingly, further chromatographic analysis revealed that the relative ratio of the determined carotenoids and ergosterol was very different among the control, naftifine-treated and repigmented forms. The torulene and C<sub>nd</sub> carotenoids were much lower in the repigmented forms than for the control batch, indicating an alteration of carotenogenesis after naftifine treatment, but &#x003b2;-carotene and ergosterol were much higher (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

The laser was focused on the sample using a 100x objective, and the spectra were recorded with 10-s exposure times and 2 accumulations. The experiments were done in triplicate.</p><p id="Par34">Resonant Raman maps were obtained by raster-scanning the selected area with the 532-nm laser, focused on the sample using a 5x objective. The laser power was set to 10%. The exposure time for each spectrum was 2&#x02009;s and the measurement step was 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m.

An Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with an on-line vacuum degasser, quaternary pump, temperature-controlled sample tray, automatic injector, column thermostat compartment and DAD detector was employed, with a Nucleosil 100 C18 column (240 mm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4.6 mm, 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m particle size) from Macherey-Nagel (Duren, Germany).

As a standard, &#x003b2;-carotene at a concentration of 1&#x02009;mg/mL was used. An isocratic elution was employed using acetonitrile:methanol:isopropanol at 85:10:5, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. UV-Vis detection of compounds was accomplished using the DAD detector to measure the entire spectrum in the 190&#x02013;700&#x02009;nm range every 1&#x02009;s, and the chromatograms were monitored at 254, 450, 490 and 512&#x02009;nm. The chromatograms were exported and the graphs were developed in Excel and Origin 6, where the integration of the peaks was also performed. HPTLC was performed on HP silica gel plates (Silica gel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using hexane-acetone-methanol (10:15:75&#x02009;v/v/v) as the mobile phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p id="Par36">
<italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic> cells were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JEOL JSM 5510 LV electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL JEM 1010 electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan). The samples were fixed in 2.7% glutaraldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline for 90&#x02009;minutes). For SEM, the samples were critical-point dried in liquid CO<sub>2</sub>, mounted on sticky carbon tabs and sputter-coated with gold (10&#x02009;nm). For TEM, the fixed and dried samples were infiltrated with resin (Epon 812), deposited onto colloidal-carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The chemicals needed for electron microscopy experiments were purchased as follows: glutaraldehyde, resin (Epon 812), lead citrate, uranyl acetate, bismuth subnitrate (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, USA); sticky carbon tabs, colloidal carbon coated grids (Agar Scientific, Cambridge, England).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to several data sets as indicated in the text using Statistica 7.0. T-tests were used to test the strength of association within the data. Where appropriate, using p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 as threshold for statistical significance, a statistical approach was formulated and the experimental data were also evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical parameters confirm the hypothesis that the differences between the results are either not significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05), significant (0.001&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) or highly significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The average of multiple measurements (duplicates, triplicates or more, depending on type of measurement) was used for plots, and the error bars are the standard error of the mean.
