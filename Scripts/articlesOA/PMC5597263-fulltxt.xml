Natural Killer (NK) cells play a critical role in regulating murine CMV infection via NK cell recognition of the Ly49H cell surface receptor of the viral-encoded m157 ligand expressed at the infected cell surface. This Ly49H NK receptor/m157 ligand interaction has been found to mediate host resistance to CMV in the spleen, and lung, but is much less effective in the liver, so it is not known if this interaction is important in the context of SNHL. Using a murine model for CMV-induced labyrinthitis, we have demonstrated that the Ly49H/m157 interaction mediates host resistance in the temporal bone. BALB/c mice, which lack functional Ly49H, inoculated with mCMV at post-natal day 3 developed profound hearing loss and significant outer hair cell loss by 28 days of life. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice, competent for the Ly49H/m157 interaction, had minimal hearing loss and attenuated outer hair cell loss with the same mCMV dose. Administration of Ly49H blocking antibody or inoculation with a mCMV viral strain deleted for the m157 gene rendered the previously resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain susceptible to hearing loss to a similar extent as the BALB/c mouse strain indicating a direct role of the Ly49H/m157 interaction in mCMV-dependent hearing loss. Additionally, NK cell recruitment to sites of infection was evident in the temporal bone of inoculated susceptible mouse strains. These results demonstrate participation of NK cells in protection from CMV-induced labyrinthitis and SNHL in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission from an infected mother to her fetus is a leading cause of permanent hearing loss in children, but the contributing processes are not clear. In this report, we utilized a mouse model, which recapitulates many features of congenital CMV mediated childhood hearing loss, to demonstrate that natural killer cells (NK), a component of early host immune response to infection, play a critical protective role in CMV-induced hearing loss. Specifically, we determined that NK cells interact with CMV infected cells through binding of the NK cell receptor, Ly49H, with a virally-encoded protein, m157, expressed on the cell surface of CMV infected inner ear cells, to mediate the protective effect. Findings from this study provide insight into the host immune response during CMV-induced hearing loss in mice.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Triological Society</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9089-3014</contrib-id><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Albert H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY020853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY014800</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by a 2013 Career Development Award from the Triological Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.triological.org/researchgrants.html">http://www.triological.org/researchgrants.html</ext-link>) to AHP, by National Institute of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8826125&#x00026;icde=32115046&#x00026;ddparam=&#x00026;ddvalue=&#x00026;ddsub=&#x00026;cr=1&#x00026;csb=default&#x00026;cs=ASC">https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8826125&#x00026;icde=32115046&#x00026;ddparam=&#x00026;ddvalue=&#x00026;ddsub=&#x00026;cr=1&#x00026;csb=default&#x00026;cs=ASC</ext-link>) grant EY020853 to JY and grants from National Institute of Health (EY014800) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9123599&#x00026;icde=32115066&#x00026;ddparam=&#x00026;ddvalue=&#x00026;ddsub=&#x00026;cr=5&#x00026;csb=default&#x00026;cs=ASC">https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9123599&#x00026;icde=32115066&#x00026;ddparam=&#x00026;ddvalue=&#x00026;ddsub=&#x00026;cr=5&#x00026;csb=default&#x00026;cs=ASC</ext-link>) and the Research to Prevent Blindness Fund (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rpbusa.org/rpb/grants-and-research/grants/current-grant-recipients/institutional-grantees/">https://www.rpbusa.org/rpb/grants-and-research/grants/current-grant-recipients/institutional-grantees/</ext-link>) for support of imaging facilities.

The consequences of hearing loss for affected children include speech and language delay, poor education attainment, and poor occupational performance in adulthood [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The total cost for each child with hearing loss is estimated to be over three hundred thousand dollars accounting for the lost productivity, the need for special education, vocational rehabilitation, assistive devices and medical costs [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One study estimates the total costs to the United States associated with congenital CMV infection to be $4 billion a year [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite the known significant health burden caused by congenital CMV induced hearing loss, very little is known about its pathogenesis including considerable uncertainty regarding the roles of direct viral replication in the cochlea and the contribution of host immune responses. An animal model that accurately recapitulates human CMV-induced hearing loss has been developed to evaluate more effective strategies for prevention and treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our group and others have successfully demonstrated that murine CMV (mCMV)-induced labyrinthitis in BALB/c murine newborn pups occurs when green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing mCMV was used to inoculate newborn mice via an intracerebral (IC) injection [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies recapitulate viral mediated hearing loss in human infant because a critical factor for effective correlation between the mouse model and the clinical condition is that the mouse auditory system at birth is analogous to the human fetal auditory system and does not achieve stable thresholds until 4 weeks of age [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When infected at birth, fifty-five percent had profound hearing loss (&#x02265; 80 dB) at 4 weeks of age, while the other forty-five percent initially showed moderate hearing loss that progressed to profound hearing loss by 6&#x02013;8 weeks. These findings mirror the longitudinal human clinical studies that show that 50% of children with hearing loss have worsening thresholds over time [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, asymmetric hearing loss occurred in 40% of the mice, similar to the rate of 50% among children with congenital CMV infection observed by Fowler and colleagues [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, we also showed that this susceptibility to CMV-induced hearing loss was age dependent. While all of the postnatal day three (P3) infected mice showed elevated auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds at 4 weeks of age, only fifteen percent of the P8, and none of the P14 infected mice had hearing loss. Pass et al. demonstrated an age dependent effect in children with congenital CMV infection who were more likely to develop hearing loss when infected during the first trimester rather than later in pregnancy [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The mouse model is relevant to evaluate the viral host interactions that involve the innate and adaptive immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previous studies have established that the response to mCMV infection is strain-dependent in mice, with susceptibility determined by expression of the Ly49H gene (Klra8 killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily A, member 8) in the distal portion of the natural killer cell gene complex [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During the early phase of infection, the Ly49H receptor recognizes m157, a viral-encoded class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) homologue expressed at the cell surface of mCMV infected cells. Despite the adaptation of viral expression of the MHC as an immune evasion tactic [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the interaction of m157 with the Ly49H receptor triggers NK cell activation and elimination of the infected cells in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although Ly49H recognition of m157 is critical to controlling viral titers in the spleen and lung, it is much less effective in controlling virus replication in the liver.

NK cells function in the early innate response via cytolytic activity and affect the adaptive immune response through release of cytokines. In mice, recognition of virally infected cells is largely coordinated by the Ly49 C-type lectin family of homodimeric receptors, which have both activating and inhibitory isoforms. Numerous studies in mice have established that NK cell expression of the Ly49H receptor confers resistance to mCMV infection through early recognition of the virally-encoded m157 cell surface antigen [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

However, Ly49H/m157 interactions are less effective in other tissues such as the liver, so it was unclear if these interactions are relevant for mCMV-induced hearing loss in neonatal mice as we now demonstrate. DPOAE and ABR testing consistently showed elevated hearing thresholds and cochleograms demonstrated greater outer hair cell loss in the susceptible BALB/c mouse strain as compared to the near normal thresholds and minimal outer hair cell loss in the resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. The fact that NK cell depletion by IP injection of neonatal mice (P2) with anti-asialo GM1 antibody increases mCMV titer and reduced cytokine production in brain indicates that the NK cell response participates in mCMV infection in newborn mice after IC injection [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that mCMV susceptibility to hearing loss is mediated, at least in part, by NK cells. We recognize that Ly49H receptor expression on NK cells has not been explicitly established and it remains possible that the blocking antibody interacts with an alternate target that results in hearing loss, however, that both addition of the Ly49H blocking antibody and infection with an m157 deficient viral strain rendered C57BL/6 mouse susceptible to mCMV hearing loss and cochlear damage suggests the Ly49H receptor/m157 interaction participates in mCMV-induced hearing loss. Additionally, NK cell co-localization with GFP expressing mCMV infected cells dramatically increased in the cochlea of normally resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain after blockade of the Ly49H receptor consistent with the requirement for physical interaction between NK cells and mCMV-infected cells for effective Ly49H engagement of m157.</p><p>Although a competent NK cell Ly49H receptor interaction with virally encoded m157 ligand in infected cells was required for otoprotection against viral infection in the cochlea, hearing was not completely preserved as DPOAE thresholds increased modestly, but significantly, in mCMV infected resistant C57BL/6 mice compared to uninfected controls. The increased DPOAE thresholds in resistant C57BL/6 mice were consistent with outer hair cell loss, which eventually reached about 50% of the loss seen in susceptible BALB/c mice, although overall OHC loss is minor and likely does not explain the full extent of hearing loss. These data indicate that a competent NK cell response is not sufficient to protect inner ear structures from damage after mCMV infection and that either NK cell clearance of infected cells was incomplete or that sequelae of infection contributed to subsequent SNHL. Furthermore, since direct evidence of mCMV infection in the hair or supporting cells within the organ of Corti was not seen suggests that secondary effects of mCMV infection are responsible for hair cell loss.</p><p>Our observation of outer hair cell loss without evidence of direct cochlear hair cell infection is consistent with previous studies of mCMV infected mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Our data demonstrates similar activation of the apoptotic cascade in the previously resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain after interruption of NK cell recognition signals suggesting that early clearance of mCMV infection by NK cells and protection from spiral ganglion apoptosis contributes to protection from hearing loss. The fact that spiral ganglion cells appear to be the major site of mCMV infection at 3-days post-infection after Ly49H receptor blockade indicates that protection of spiral ganglion cells was the main contributor to NK hearing loss protection.</p><p>It is known that individuals with defects affecting NK cell function are particularly susceptible to human CMV disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Viral stock titers were determined on M2-104B cells as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) per milliliter.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Mice</title><p>BALB/c, C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA, USA) and a C57BL/6 mouse strain that constitutively expresses red fluorescent protein (NK1.1-tdTomato knock-in mice) in NK and NKT cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] were used for experiments as indicated. Animals were housed and bred under pathogen-free conditions at the Central Animal Facility at the University of Utah.</p><p>Mice were injected via an intracerebral route at post-natal day 3 (P3) of life as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, the pups were momentarily placed on ice to induce anesthesia. The mouse was manually restrained, and a 10 &#x003bc;l Hamilton syringe with a 30G needle was inserted past the calvarium in the mid parietal region to inject 200 plaque forming units (pfu) of virus in a volume of 1 &#x003bc;l. Control groups received 1 &#x003bc;l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) carrier unless otherwise indicated. Mice were monitored for adverse effects, including mortality, behavioral abnormalities, and developmental delay. Experimental and control animals were housed separately. For groups pretreated with Ly49H blocking antibody, 20 &#x003bc;g of purified mouse anti-Ly49H monoclonal antibody (clone 3D10, cat# 14-5886-82, eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) in 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity twelve hours before the inoculation of mCMV. Control mice received 20 &#x003bc;g of purified mouse IgG isotype control antibody (cat# 02&#x02013;6502, ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA) in 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Hearing assessment</title><p>For auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing, mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine and xylazine at 100 and 10 mg/kg body weight, respectively. ABRs/DPOAEs were performed in a double-walled sound chamber (IAC Acoustics, North Aurora, IL, USA). The body temperature was maintained at ~37&#x000b0;C via a heating pad. A small incision was made at the tragus to allow better access to the ear canal. For ABR testing, an electrostatic speaker (EC-1, Tucker-Davis Technology, Alachua, FL, USA) fitted with a 1.5 cm long polyethylene tube was placed abutting the ear canal. Needle electrodes were placed subcutaneously at the mastoid of the tested side and vertex, with a remote ground electrode placed in the rump area. ABR thresholds were measured bilaterally in all mice. ABR signals were amplified with a TDT RA4 pre-amplifier (Tucker-Davis Technology), filtered from 100 to 3000 Hz, averaged and digitized with a TDT RA16BA processor controlled by BioSigRP software (Tucker-Davis Technology). Acoustic stimuli were digitally generated and processed by a RX6 real-time processor and passed through a PA5 attenuator prior to delivery to the speaker amplifier at a rate 24&#x02013;32 times/sec. Responses to 1,000 sweeps were averaged for a series of responses to tone pips ranging from 8 to 32 kHz (5 ms with 0.5 ms cos2 rise and fall) using 5 or 10 dB intensity steps, over a 15&#x02013;90 dB of sound pressure level (dB SPL) range. ABR traces were visually inspected after plotting the amplitude of each peak against stimulus intensity. Thresholds typically corresponded to a level one step below that at which the peak-to-peak response amplitude began to rise. An ABR threshold of 90 dB SPL (i.e., the highest stimuli presented in this study) was assigned to cochleae that failed to stimulate an ABR waveform at 90 dB SPL. The DPOAEs were measured using an ER-10B+ (Etymotic Research, Elk Grove, IL, USA) microphone coupled with two EC1 speakers. Stimuli of two primary tones f1 and f2 (f2/f1 = 1.2) were presented with f2 = f1&#x02013;10 dB. Primary tones were stepped from 30 to 80 dB SPL (for f1) in 10 dB increments and swept from 8 to 32 kHz in octave steps. Stimuli were generated and attenuated digitally (200 kHz sampling). The ear canal sound pressure was pre-amplified and digitized. A fast Fourier transformation was computed, and the sound pressures at f1, f2, and 2f1- f2 were extracted after spectral averaging from 50 serial waveform traces (each corresponding to 84 ms of digitized ear canal sound pressure waveform). The noise floor (average of 10 points in the FFT on either side of 2f1-f2) was also measured: it ranged between -25 and 0 dB SPL, depending on the test frequencies. All data were shown in mean &#x000b1; SEM. The mice hearing reaches mature thresholds by 3 weeks of age [<xref rid="ppat.1006599.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To avoid potential confounding results due to immaturity of the auditory system in mCMV infected mice, we chose to test our animals beginning 4 weeks of age.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Immunofluorescent histology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and exsanguinated by transcardial (left ventricle to right atrium) perfusion with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 containing 100 U/ml heparin followed by 20 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB) at room temperature (RT).
