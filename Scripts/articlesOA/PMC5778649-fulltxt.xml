Modern anatomically designed shoulder arthroplasty systems have proven to provide significant pain relief and improvement of function over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Long-term survivorship is mostly affected by implant related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although loosening of the glenoid component is more common than stem related problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], given the growing number of shoulder replacements and revision surgeries, the humeral side becomes increasingly clinically relevant. Loosening is not the only indication for revision, as removal of the humeral stem is also required for implant unrelated complications such as infection or secondary rotator cuff tear. In revision surgery, complications commonly arise with difficulty of stem removal, cement extraction, bone loss or osteolysis due to polyethylene wear debris, and intraoperative fracture associated with potentially longer operating times, increased risk of infection, nerve injuries, and worse outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Shaft malunion after fracture, where the deformity does not allow an anatomic positioning of the humeral stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], is another challenging situation to treat.</p><p id="Par10">An expedient alternative is humeral head resurfacing. Nevertheless, humeral resurfacing is a technically challenging procedure requiring at least 60% of intact humeral head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Firstly, it is mandatory to find the correct centre of rotation to avoid overstuffing and secondly with the remaining head in situ correct glenoid component implantation may be difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">A contemporary, promising alternative are stemless anatomic shoulder implants, which generally rely on metaphyseal or meta- and epiphyseal fixation, combining the advantages of humeral head resurfacing and common shoulder replacement. Potential benefits are (1) the possibility of anatomic shoulder reconstruction regardless of medial and posterior offset of the proximal humerus, caput-collum-diaphyseal angle, and retrotorsion of the humeral head; (2) the ability to perform implantation in fracture sequelae with shaft malunion and secondary post-fracture situations with humeral head deformities; (3) good glenoid exposure; (4) bone stock preservation; and (5) facilitating further revision surgery.</p><p id="Par12">The main purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate radiological changes around the humeral component of a stemless shoulder implant with hollow screw fixation and their influence on clinical outcome. We hypothesized that clinical mid-term outcome after stemless humeral head replacement would be affected by radiological changes. Secondary objectives were to compare operating times between stemless and stemmed hemi- and total shoulder arthroplasty and to report short and mid-term clinical outcome after stemless hemi- and total shoulder arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">Between September 2005 and December 2011, a total of 136 shoulder arthroplasties using a stemless humeral head implant were performed by two experienced surgeons (W.A., B.K.) at our clinic. The stemless humeral head replacement (Eclipse&#x02122; Shoulder Prosthesis, Arthrex Inc., Naples, FL, USA) consists of an anatomical humeral head, which is mounted on a baseplate (trunion) for cortical support at the anatomical neck (epiphyseal fixation) and fixated to the cancellous metaphyseal bone over a screw-in mechanism with a hollow screw (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The stemless humeral head Eclipse prosthesis consists of three components: the anatomical humeral head; the trunion for epiphyseal fixation; and the hollow cage screw for metaphyseal fixation.

Patients with any kind of rotator cuff tears, cuff tear arthropathies, axillary nerve lesions, or revision arthroplasty were not suitable for this procedure. HSA was indicated, when the glenoid presented without erosion and macroscopically fairly intact cartilage. Included were all patients between 40 and 85&#x000a0;years of age at the time of surgery, who were scheduled for primary anatomical shoulder replacement for the treatment of degenerative, rheumatic, posttraumatic osteoarthritis and fracture sequelae.

During the study period 11 patients died from unrelated causes (five before and six after the short follow-up) and one patient with bilateral implants withdrew from the study before the short follow-up due to an unexpected comorbidity. A complete, prospectively collected data set before, two years (short follow-up) and at least 48&#x000a0;months (mid-term follow-up) after surgery, or until indicated revision surgery was required for inclusion of radiographic and clinical evaluation.</p><p id="Par16">Additionally, operating times of a consecutive cohort of 93 patients (100 implants), who underwent anatomical shoulder arthroplasty with a stemmed anatomical shaft prostheses (Anatomical Shoulder&#x02122; System, Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA) by the same two experienced surgeons (W.A., B.K.) at our clinic were obtain.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p id="Par17">Patients were operated under general anaesthesia combined with an interscalene block. Through a standard deltopectoral approach after tenotomy of the subscapularis tendon and exposition of the humeral head, a resection at the anatomical neck was performed.</p><p id="Par18">Thereafter, for the stemless procedure, the humeral head size was determined using templates and the best fitting length of a hollow screw, which allows trabecular ingrowth into the bone and fixation to the trunion, was assessed with a measure pin. A hole for the cage screw was prepared with a hand coring reamer. In case of glenoid replacement, a standard cemented all-polyethylene glenoid component (Arthrex Inc., Naples, FL, USA) was implanted. Again the humeral head was exposed and with a centering device, the trunion of the previously determined head size was impacted for epiphyseal fixation. Thereafter, the appropriate hollow screw was advanced until the screw head was flush with the neck of the trunion. Finally, the correct humeral head was mounted. The subscapularis tendon was reattached with two suture anchors (titanium Corkscrew FT-III, Arthrex) and the wound was closed. Immediately postoperative, fluoroscopic images in two planes were taken to confirm correct implant positioning. Routine follow-ups were scheduled two weeks, three months, one, two, and five years after the procedure. The operating time from incision to final closure for each shoulder replacement was prospectively recorded.</p><p id="Par19">Postoperatively, the arm was secured with an abduction cushion (UltraSling, Breg MDSS GmbH, Hannover, Germany). The physiotherapy regimen included immediate passive motion and passive assisted motion with closed chain exercises to work scapula-thoracic muscles after up to seven days.

Humeral head implants were considered to be at risk of loosening, if complete osteolysis was detectable in two or more zones.

We were not only able to show that clinical and radiological results with the stemless shoulder prosthesis showed favourable improvements from pre- to short and mid-term outcome with no revision surgery due to humeral component loosening, we also had to reject our hypothesis that radiological changes would negatively impact clinical outcome. Constant scores were not significantly different between patients with and without radiological changes in the mid-term follow-up.</p><p id="Par35">Recently, comparable Constant scores were detected by Habermeyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In accordance to the literature for stemmed shoulder arthroplasty, TSA showed significantly higher relative Constant Scores than HSA in this study, and values remained stable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As the present study and current literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] demonstrated, stemless shoulder arthroplasty provides similar clinical results as established stemmed arthroplasty systems. The main focus of our study was the radiologic behaviour of the implant and its influence on clinical outcome. Interestingly, the present results regarding radiolucencies and osteolysis are rather different to the findings of Habermeyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], who reported an osteolysis rate of not more than 4%. Such variations could be explained by the fact that radiographs were assessed and classified differently. While we adapted a rather concise nomenclature, Habermeyer did not provide detailed information regarding the classification protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the presence of osteolysis did not affect clinical outcome or revision rates. Comparable to Habermeyer&#x02019;s findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], internal stress shielding occurred in half of the implants in one or more zones with the majority around the greater tuberosity. Again, no influence on clinical outcome could be seen in either study.</p><p id="Par36">The majority of abnormal radiological findings occurred either in the superior part of the trunion or in the inferior implant bone interface near the calcar, often leading to partial osteolysis similar to the already known phenomenon described by Raiss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Radiolucencies in the superior and inferior parts of the trunion could be explained with the results of finite element analyses (FEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. FEA suggested that superposition of force and moment induced stresses in weak inferior cortical bone support is leading to higher migration values within the inferior trunion-bone interface and is therefore resulting in a shift of the centre of rotation. The bone adaptation and resorption around the implant is mostly dependent on the stability of the hollow screw and is caused by axial bending stiffness similar to the concept explained by Nagels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Since such radiological findings were not reflected in the clinical outcome, an arbitrary definition of an implant at risk had to be established. Thus, we assumed that if an implant showed the presence of osteolysis in two or more zones, the humeral head component might become unstable.</p><p id="Par37">Currently, few different stemless shoulder implant systems are on the market with sporadic report of short-term outcome. A major strengths of the Eclipse prosthesis is that it is the only implant with a different fixation mechanism not relying on impaction implantation and therefore avoiding a potential risk of metaphyseal fracture or implant migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Revision surgeries followed an already well-known pattern. In hemiarthroplasties the majority of revisions were due to secondary glenoid erosion (20.5%), which was similar to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Secondary cuff failure was the main cause for revision (15.2%) in total shoulder arthroplasty. The higher revision rate due to secondary rotator cuff ruptures in the present trial compared to rates (&#x0003c;&#x02009;8%) reported by Sperling et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] could be explained with the relatively high mean age in the TSA-group. Other than that, reasons for revision were traumatic surgical neck of humerus fracture, undefined pain for neglected long head of biceps tendon, and symptomatic mes acromion. However, no revision surgery was indicated due to humeral component loosening or polyethylene glenoid component loosening in this patient cohort.</p><p id="Par39">Fortunately, but not surprisingly, revision surgery with such a stemless implant compared to stemmed prostheses were fairly easy as the removal of the humeral component does not require any special manoeuvres (e.g. osteotomy) and leaves a rather anatomic situation with the whole metaphysis in place.</p><p id="Par40">Last but not least, shorter operating times, another strength of stemless humeral head surgery, with HSA as well as with TSA in comparison with a stemmed anatomic shoulder arthroplasty system could be observed. This fact is not surprising, but worth mentioning since 20&#x000a0;min less on operating time is a benefit for the patient regarding reduced anaesthesia time and blood loss, not to mention the advantage in time management and therefore cost effectiveness. As the humeral component implantation is a rather easy procedure, which is also reflected by the significant shorter operating time compared to stemmed shoulder arthroplasty, the learning curve for this surgical technique is quite steep.</p><p id="Par41">Although results of this mid-term trial are promising, long-term outcome regarding implant stability needs to be reported. Another limitation is that in-depth subjective assessments (e.g. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons or quality of life scores) are missing. Furthermore, assessment of bone mineral density in the humeral head prior to implantation would have been desirable as bone mineral density might influence implant ingrowth and the possible appearance of osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Unfortunately, our institution does not offer the possibility to assess bone mineral density in the shoulder. However, we believe that the present results outweigh these limitations by the thorough radiographic analysis demonstrating that radiological findings do not influence clinical outcome. We speculate that in the future a humeral head replacement with a shaft may only be indicated under rare circumstances, while the majority of patients, at least according to our results, can be successfully treated with a stemless humeral head replacement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">Promising clinical mid-term results with or without minor radiographic findings suggest that the concept of this stemless humeral head prosthesis might be an expedient alternative to existing shoulder replacements. Anatomical cutting of the humeral head and hollow screw fixation allow a familiar access to the glenoid combined with a shaft independent, less complex bone-sparing surgery along with shorter operating times and favourable revision situation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FEA</term><def><p id="Par6">Finite element analyses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSA</term><def><p id="Par7">Hemi shoulder arthroplasties</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSA</term><def><p id="Par8">Total shoulder arthroplasties (TSA)</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Sylvia Salem to this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par43">No funding was received for this study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par44">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>WA and PRH made substantial contributions to conception and design; GB, LP, and BK collected data; PRH and BL performed analysis and interpretation of data; PRH, GB, LP, BL, BK, and WA have been involved in drafting the manuscript as well as revising it critically for important intellectual content.
