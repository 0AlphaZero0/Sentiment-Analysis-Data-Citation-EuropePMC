It remains largely unknown to what extent the local proteome of tumors intrinsically differs. Here, we used hepatocellular carcinoma as a model system to quantify both inter- and intratumor heterogeneity across human patient specimens with spatial resolution. We defined proteomic features that distinguish neoplastic from the directly adjacent nonneoplastic tissue, such as decreased abundance of NADH dehydrogenase complex I. We then demonstrated the existence of intratumoral variations in protein abundance that re-occur across different patient samples, and affect clinically relevant proteins, even in the absence of obvious morphological differences or genetic alterations. Our work demonstrates the suitability and the benefits of using mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze diagnostic tumor specimens with spatial resolution. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD007052.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity is a major challenge in personalized medicine, because it directly affects the robustness of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker predictions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Even within a defined tumor entity, the variation of biomarker expression between different patients and across different tumor regions of the same individual specimen (<italic>e.g.</italic> center <italic>versus</italic> periphery) needs to be considered. Particularly the latter is of immediate clinical importance, when only a small tumor fraction can be obtained in the setting of a diagnostic/pretreatment biopsy, and thus the region of withdrawal could directly impact the acquired expression profile. Routine diagnostics of tumors involves evaluation of histomorphological features by conventional microscopy. Although it is often combined with immunohistochemical staining (IHC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> of marker proteins, the number of proteins that can be quantitatively analyzed by IHC is rather limited by the availability of suitable antibodies and the experimental throughput. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables the quantitative analysis of protein abundances on a proteome-wide scale, but the majority of previous proteomic analyses of cancer specimens have only focused on the bulk tumor, not taking the spatial context within an individual specimen into account (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer tissue offers the best possible material to routinely study intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) because: (1) FFPE specimens provide excellent integrity of the tissue architecture (superior to frozen specimens), which allows, in combination with Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), the precise and reproducible spatial separation of local tissue regions; (2) human FFPE specimens are the central part of the clinico-pathological workflow and reflect the standard processing of tissue specimens in pathological routine diagnostics worldwide; (3) FFPE tissues are intrinsically linked to clinical records and often associated with additional pathological data (genomics, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, immunohistochemistry etc.).</p><p>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has been already used to study FFPE cancer tissue specimens (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but rarely in combination with spatial resolution (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), because the amount of material that can be obtained from a specific region of an FFPE specimen limits the comprehensiveness, <italic>i.e.</italic> number of identified and quantified proteins. Therefore, the great advantage of excellent spatial preservation of FFPE material has not yet been exploited to systematically and jointly analyze inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity across multiple specimens.</p><p>Here, we describe a universal workflow that is based on LCM to separate different tumor regions, followed by ultrasensitive and rapid peptide isolation using the paramagnetic bead technology named SP3 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS). This workflow enables the reproducible proteomic analysis of FFPE material with very good proteomic coverage and spatial resolution. To demonstrate the power of this workflow, we investigated both inter- and intratumoral proteomic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the 5th most frequent cancer worldwide (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), represents the 2nd most frequent cause of cancer related death, and shows a rapidly rising incidence rate, with an annual increase of 2% in the US (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The therapeutic options for HCC patients are still limited with less than 20% of HCC patients being amenable for a curative treatment (partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation). Accordingly, the prognosis of symptomatic HCC patients is extremely poor, with a five-year-survival of less than 5%. Important insights into the molecular basis and diversity of HCC have been provided by genomic and transcriptomic approaches (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), including prediction of tumor relapse (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Nevertheless, disease relevant alterations at the proteomic level (directly shaping the tumor phenotype), particularly in a spatial context, remain poorly defined. Notably, the heterogeneity of HCCs is less apparent at the histomorphological level, in contrast to other tumor entities, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p><p>Here we analyzed the spatial abundance of thousands of proteins across different tumor sectors, nontumorous tissue and across interindividual HCC samples. We show that spatial proteomic analysis accurately recovers known factors associated with HCC, but also identifies novel potential therapeutic candidates. We demonstrate that various, often functionally related proteins, display heterogeneous expression within a tumor that is not reflected on the genetic or gene expression level. Among these, there are known prognostic markers for HCC. Thus, dissecting the &#x0201c;submorphological&#x0201d; inter- and intratumor spatial proteomic heterogeneity may critically support and improve conventional diagnostic procedures, prognosis estimation and ultimately therapeutic options in precision liver oncology.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale</title><p>To investigate the HCC proteome, 5 tumors from different patients were analyzed by two TMT-10plex experiments. First we compared tumor <italic>versus</italic> adjacent nontumoral tissue and then we analyzed difference between tumor center and periphery. For differential protein expression, each patient-sample was treated individually. Protein ratios were calculated for all the protein groups quantified with at least 2 proteotypic peptides. A two components model was fitted on centered ratio distributions. Protein groups with a q value &#x0003c; 0.2 were considered as differential expressed between the conditions tested.</p><p>For murine HCC proteome we used label-free quantification (LFQ) approach to analyze extracted tumors from 11 mouse models (1 sample per condition) of different genetic background.

The column was a Gemini C18 column (3 &#x003bc;m, 110 &#x0212b;, 100 &#x000d7; 1.0 mm, Phenomenex) with a Gemini C18, 4 &#x000d7; 2.0 mm SecurityGuard (Phenomenex) cartridge as a guard column. The solvent system consisted of 20 m<sc>m</sc> ammonium formate (pH 10.0) as mobile phase (A) and 100% acetonitrile as mobile phase (B). The separation was accomplished at a mobile phase flow rate of 0.1 ml/min using the following linear gradient for TMT-6plex experiment: 99% A for 2 min, from 99% A to 37.5% B in 61 min, to 85% B in a further 1 min, and held at 85% B for an additional 5 min, before returning to 99% A and re-equlibration for 18 min. Thirty seven fractions were collected along with the LC separation that were subsequently pooled into 16 fractions. For TMT-10plex experiment, a slightly modified gradient was used, whereby the LC separation time was 100 min from 10% to 40% B and 48 fractions were collected over this separation time, which were again subsequently pooled into 16 fractions.

Peptides were separated using the nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters) fitted with a trapping (nanoAcquity Symmetry C18, 5 &#x003bc;m, 180 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 20 mm) and an analytical column (nanoAcquity BEH C18, 2.5 &#x003bc;m, 75 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 500 mm). The outlet of the analytical column was coupled directly to an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Proxeon nanospray source. Solvent A was water, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and solvent B was acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The samples were loaded with a constant flow of solvent A at 5 &#x003bc;l/min, onto the trapping column. Trapping time was 6 min. Peptides were eluted via the analytical column at a constant flow of 0.3 &#x003bc;l/min, at 55 &#x000b0;C.

The correlation with gene expression profiles varied between specimens (R Pearson ranging from 0.13 to 0.47), and as previously observed, Tumor 1 showed an opposite trend with a negative correlation (R Pearson = &#x02212;0.2). Taken together, these data show that the obtained proteome profiles are informative of the tumor status of the liver tissue and can reveal interpatient heterogeneity that manifests at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>).</p><p>Although various protein groups that were affected in abundance were known to be HCC associated, others might have a yet to be defined function in HCC. For instance, we identified Nestin (NEST)&#x02014;a protein involved in the regulation of G2/M transition&#x02014;to be up-regulated in the tumor compared with the peritumoral tissue. Consistent with our data, NEST has been reported to be overexpressed in HCC and associated with poor prognosis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We also found that multiple components of minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM complex), involved in DNA synthesis and replication during initiation of S phase, are generally up-regulated in analyzed tumors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S3<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). Consistently, the up-regulation of MCM proteins has been previously connected with different cancers including HCC (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). One of the components of the complex, MCM6, was proposed as a novel HCC marker (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).

We then retained only hits that, while being differential expressed at the protein level, showed no or modest difference in gene expression (148 hits in total, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). Network analysis revealed that these proteins are functionally related. Among the down-regulated proteins, we found an enrichment for the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex I, possibly indicating a difference in subcellular compartmentalization between tumor and nonneoplastic tissues that is not reflected in gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Specific proteomic changes are not recovered by gene expression analysis.</bold>

In the murine models, we observed a significant shift of mitochondrial proteins toward negative values suggesting a decreased number of mitochondria in tumors as compared with normal livers.

All the other compartment groups show similar fold change distributions. <italic>D</italic>, Changes in the mtDNA copy number. Barplot showing the fold-change (log2) of mtDNA abundance in tumor compared with peritumoral tissues. To quantify the mtDNA content, two mitochondrial genes (<italic>MT-RNR1</italic> and <italic>MT-TL1</italic>) were analyzed using qPCR (the nuclear gene <italic>B2M</italic> was used for normalization). T1-T5 correspond to the analyzed HCC specimen. The abundance of mtDNA in renal oncocytoma (RO) tumor samples, which are known to have a larger number of mitochondria (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), was also quantified as a positive control. For T4 we were not able to quantify the difference in content of mtDNA because of the lack of peritumoral tissue in the remaining paraffin block of this tumor. T1 in contrasts to other HCC specimens has increased number of mtDNA, which is in line with our proteomics analysis of this particular specimen (see discussion).

We quantitatively compared 11 fresh frozen murine HCC samples to normal murine livers using label free quantification (see Methods). Consistently with human HCC specimens, we also detected a strong decrease mitochondrial of NADH dehydrogenase complex I across all the murine models tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). We next classified the measured proteins according to their subcellular localization and compared the distribution of the calculated fold changes. In case of murine models, we noticed a significant decrease in the amount of mitochondrial proteins in the tumor part that could explain the decreased abundance of NADH dehydrogenase complex I. However, in case of human HCCs, we observed a much less pronounced, nevertheless still significant, decrease of mitochondrial proteins in only half of the analyzed specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S5</ext-link>). This was not consistent with the decrease of NADH dehydrogenase complex I that was detected in most of the specimens (on average 2-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). To check whether our proteomics data reflects differences in the subcellular compartmentalization in HCC, we assessed the abundance of mitochondria in the analyzed specimens using an independent approach. The most informative methods of estimating mitochondrial content are based on assays measuring directly mitochondrial activity in cells or tissue extracts (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Unfortunately, FFPE tissues are not suitable for such analyses because of fixation. We therefore decided to quantify the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as a proxy for mitochondria abundance, bearing in mind those other factors may also influence this quantity. Alterations in mtDNA copy number are in fact a common feature of multiple cancer types, however they do not always correlate with the changes in the expression of mitochondrial proteins (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>We compared the ratio mtDNA/nuclear DNA (nDNA) between tumoral and peritumoral tissues using qPCR. For the analysis we selected two genes encoded by mtDNA (<italic>MT-TL1</italic> encoding 12S rRNA and <italic>MT-RNR1</italic> encoding tRNA-leu) and normalized them to the nuclear gene <italic>B2M</italic>. To validate the assay accuracy, we analyzed samples of renal oncocytoma - a tumor type that has been previously reported to contain a higher number of mitochondria (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). For all the samples analyzed except for tumor 1, we observed around 2-fold decrease of the mtDNA/nDNA ratio (for both reporter genes), which is in line with our proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). These data confirm a reduced mitochondrial content in tumor regions as compared with the surrounding hepatic parenchyma.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that proteomic analysis of tumor samples can (1) reveal changes in protein abundance that do not manifest at the gene expression level, (2) detect broad alterations in subcellular compartmentalization between normal and cancer cells, (3) identify a decreased level of NADH dehydrogenase complex I in HCCs that likely represent a metabolic rearrangement of the tumor cells consistent with the Warburg effect (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinically Relevant Proteins Show Intratumoral Heterogeneity</title><p>Next, we investigated the level of ITH across multiple patients and analyzed proteomes of two distinct tumor regions from the same five specimens used for tumor <italic>versus</italic> nonneoplastic tissue comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Five thousand six hundred fifty-nine protein groups were quantified with at least two proteotypic peptides per group (4275 of which were cross-quantified across all the 10 TMT channels, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Table S2</ext-link>). As expected, unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the correlation of the proteome profiles revealed that differences across tumors are much more pronounced than the variations within the same specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). To identify proteins that are differentially expressed across tumor regions in multiple specimens, we analyzed each pair of tumor sectors individually as performed for tumor <italic>versus</italic> nonneoplastic tissues (see Methods and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S6</ext-link>). We then extracted 43 protein groups that were significantly changed in at least two of the analyzed specimens (q value &#x0003c; 0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Table S4</ext-link>). Among these, two of the most striking examples of proteins previously shown to be clinically relevant for HCC are SerpinB3 (SPB3) and SerpinB4 (SPB4), also known as squamous cell carcinoma antigens (SCCAs). We found both proteins to be homogenously expressed across tumor regions only in one of the five tumors analyzed. In other specimens we observed strong changes in protein abundance that were always consistent between SPB3 and SPB4, with both proteins being in some cases more abundant at the tumor periphery and in others at the tumor center (up to 16-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). These data suggest that the ITH of SCCAs might be independent from the tumor geometry, but rather derive from other, yet to be characterized cues. It is worth mentioning that these proteins were previously proposed as histological markers of HCC (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Our analysis shows that the diagnostic outcome may drastically differ if different sectors of tumor are analyzed.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Proteome-level intratumoral heterogeneity in HCCs is highly patient specific.</bold>

Except for a group of biological processes linked to mitochondrial metabolism that we found to be down-regulated at the tumor periphery in multiple specimens, we generally observed distinct biological functions to be affected in different tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>). These functions are often related to protein synthesis, cell adhesion, and energy and drug metabolism. For instance, we found the microtubule-interacting protein stathmin (STMN1) and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCS) to be increased at the tumor periphery in most of the analyzed specimens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S7<italic>A</italic> and S7<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Both these proteins are required for tumor cell migration in HCC (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and STMN1 has been proposed as a negative prognostic marker in liver cancer (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Thus, these findings indicate that spatial proteomic ITH analysis provides an additional level at which functionally/prognostically relevant proteins in HCC should be verified. Such analysis can be used to pinpoint potentially more robust diagnostic markers that are equally expressed in all tumor sectors and show strong difference in bulk tumor <italic>versus</italic> peritumoral tissue comparison (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S7<italic>C</italic> and S7<italic>D</italic></ext-link>).</p><p>Bearing in mind the limitations derived from the small number of cases that we analyzed, we conclude that spatial proteomic ITH is detectable across multiple HCC specimens. However, differently from tumor <italic>versus</italic> nonneoplastic comparison, we observed more often patient-specific effects than general changes present in all HCCs. This manifested in the same proteins showing different patterns of ITH in different patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Our data suggests that the presence of proteome-level ITH might contribute an additional layer of interpatient variability. The example of SCCAs expression clearly indicates that proteomic ITH affects also proposed diagnostic and prognostic markers, and thus deserves further investigation in HCC as well as other cancer types.</p></sec><sec><title>Individual Tumor Specimen Analysis at High Spatial Resolution Visualizes Expression Gradients That Are Not Reflected On the Genetic Level</title><p>We next decided to push the boundaries of spatial analysis on an individual HCC specimen as it might typically occur during the clinical routine. We selected a well-differentiated tumor specimen and used FFPE slides of 10 &#x003bc;m thickness and 2 cm in diameter from half of the encapsulated spherical solid tumor (including fibrous tissue) for LCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). The accuracy of microdissection allowed removing necrotic areas and prominent blood vessels located in the center of the tumor to avoid contamination with unrelated cell types. Because no overt heterogenic subpopulations of tumor cells could be detected by conventional microscopy, we divided the tumor into three concentric sectors (TS1, TS2, and TS3) based on the distance to the center of the specimen. Additionally, we separated the tumor capsule (TC) and peritumoral tissue (PT) and compared their proteomes with the tumor itself. Using TMT labeling, we quantified 2863 protein groups with at least two proteotypic peptides across these sectors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Table S5</ext-link>). To test the compatibility with an alternative proteomic workflow, we also used label-free analysis based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to analyze an independently micro-dissected sample from the same tumor block. We obtained similar results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S8</ext-link>), and almost the same coverage (2722 protein groups cross-quantified across tumor sectors, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Table S5</ext-link>). Notably, this analysis was performed without peptide fractionation step, and required less material per spatial sector. Because only about one tenth of the obtained peptide material has been used for MS analysis, it is conceivable to improve proteomic coverage or even to further increase the spatial resolution in the future using this approach.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Highly resolved spatial proteomics of HCC specimen.</bold>

Although this finding is consistent with the fact that we chose to study a well-differentiated HCC with its morphology highly reminiscent of the adjacent nontumorous parenchymal liver tissue, we identified clusters of proteins showing distinct abundance profiles across the specimen and clearly discriminating neoplastic and nonneoplastic hepatocellular tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Fig. S9<italic>B</italic></ext-link>).

The optimal number of clusters was estimated using the &#x0201c;elbow&#x0201d; method by plotting the minimum centroid distance against the number of clusters (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We performed functional network analysis of proteins that were up- or down-regulated at the tumor periphery and showed consistent fold changes in both independent analyses (DIA and TMT). We found a strong enrichment in ribosomal components among proteins up-regulated at the peripheral sectors of the specimen. Interestingly, we also found a network of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell migration (which is in line with initially analyzed specimen, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>) showing a similar abundance profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>). These include the small GTPases RAC1 and CDC42, controlling the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, such as Actin-related protein 3 (ACTR3), and proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell migration at the extracellular level, such as Integrins beta 1 (ITGB1) beta 2 (ITGB2). We validated some of our findings by IHC staining performed on the same specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>E</italic>). For this analysis we included Decorin that shows increased expression in the tumor capsule, Hepar 1 antigen (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) that is evenly expressed across the specimen and RAC1 that shows the gradient of expression from the tumor center to the periphery of the specimen. To rule out different proliferation rates between the tumor center and the periphery potentially affecting the proteomic profiles we performed an immunohistochemical Ki67-staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>E</italic>, we observed a similar low proliferation rate (&#x0003c;2%) across the sectors.</p><p>To test if the variations of protein abundance coincide with genomic variability as detectable by a commonly used gene panel sequencing approach, we analyzed the tumor sectors and peri-tumorous tissue by targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).

Because these mutations showed largely similar allele frequencies (&#x0223c;30%) in all of the tumor sectors (except for CKD12) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA117.000189/DC1">supplemental Table S6</ext-link>), we do not expect a substantial impact onto the spatial tumor proteome. We conclude that the analysis of different tumor regions revealed that intratumoral heterogeneity is apparent at the proteome level, even in case of a specimen that is largely homogenous both at the morphological and genetic level, as determined by targeted NGS.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The aim of the presented study was to comprehensively analyze the spatial proteome of HCC on multiple levels. First, we compared neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue microdissected from 5 FFPE specimens of HCC of different etiology. We provide a comprehensive resource of the HCC proteome by integrating gene and protein expression changes of human HCCs with alterations in protein expression observed in multiple murine HCC models of different, cancer-relevant, genetic background. We identified 755 proteins that show consistent expression changes (with the same sign) except for one tumor entity. The observed differences for this specimen are higher than expected from just an interpatient heterogeneity. Careful post-analysis examination of the specimen and clinical records revealed that the corresponding patient received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment before the surgery. We therefore speculate that the unusual proteome profile of this specimen may be a consequence of the preoperative treatment. However, further investigations are required to characterize the impact of chemoterapeutic treatment on the HCC proteome <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The set of identified proteins includes multiple factors that have been already connected to HCC, but also some that have not been studied in context of liver tumorigenesis. We observed strong enrichment of ribosomal components, suggesting increased translational activity within neoplastic hepatocellular tissue. In fact, multiple oncogenic pathways have been shown to induce (de)-regulation of translational machinery, and increased protein synthesis is required to promote cellular transformation (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). These data suggest that increased translational activity facilitates HCC development.</p><p>We also identified functionally related proteins, such as NADH dehydrogenase complex I members, to be down-regulated in HCC at the protein level without being affected at the level of gene expression. Additionally, in some of the analyzed specimens, we observed a general decrease of mitochondrial proteins indicating that the total number of mitochondria in HCC is lower than in normal hepatocytes. This is supported by a corresponding decrease in mtDNA content in tumor regions as compared with adjacent tissues. A potential explanation for the reduced abundance of mitochondria is an increased mitophagy activity that selectively removes defective mitochondria from the tumor cells. In the future, it would be worthwhile to investigate further the impact of mitophagy inhibition on HCC development, as suggested for other cancer types (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, it is important to consider that the observed reduction in mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA content could also derive from a rearrangement of the mitochondrial network and structure in cancer cells, as observed in aging tissues (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>Second, we identified proteins responsible for intratumor proteome heterogeneity in HCC and highlight the relevance of ITH for biomarker discovery studies and diagnostics. ITH is a well-characterized feature of many tumors, which to date has been mainly investigated at the morphological and genetic level. Here we identified proteins that are differentially expressed between the center and the periphery of the same tumor, indicating spatially defined metabolic and functional heterogeneity of tumor cells. We identified several proteins that are significantly changed in multiple specimens of HCC, however the spatial patterns of these changes are not always consistent across the examined tumors. For example, ribosomal proteins are not only affected by ITH, but they are also one of the most prominent features up-regulated in HCCs. The same is true for the fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), which is known to be involved in other diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), but to the best of our knowledge has not been studied in context of HCC. According to our proteomics data, FABP4 appears to be overexpressed in the tumor in comparison to the nonneoplastic tissue, and at the same time displayed an uneven distribution across sectors in two of the analyzed specimens (up to 9-fold in one of the tumors).</p><p>Our comparative analysis indicates that proteomic ITH in HCC is, at least in part, functionally related to the alterations that distinguish tumor and nonneoplastic tissues. This observation might indicate the existence of heterogeneous cancer cell populations that are confined in spatially defined regions of the tumor. These different cell populations might at least to some extent resemble the nonneoplastic tissue of origin, and therefore display a variable sensitivity to drug treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe a strategy that can be universally applied to FFPE samples to investigate the abundance of thousands of proteins in solid tumors with excellent spatial resolution. Our strategy can be used jointly with other approaches based <italic>e.g.</italic> on MALDI imaging (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref><xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) or epitope-based tissue imaging (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), to deconvolute the complexity of tumor specimens and help incorporate ITH information in the design of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org">http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org</ext-link>) (21) via the PRIDE partner repository (22) with the data set identifier PXD007052.</p></sec>
