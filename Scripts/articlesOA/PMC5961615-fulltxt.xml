This study will investigate if a new information and communication technology platform, named Tele-UPCAT, is able to deliver AOT in a home setting and will test its efficacy on children and young people with UCP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised, allocation concealed (waitlist control) and evaluator-blinded clinical trial with two investigative arms will be carried out. The experimental group will perform AOT at home for 3&#x02009;weeks using a customised Tele-UPCAT system where they will watch video sequences of goal-directed actions and then complete the motor training of the same actions. The control group will receive usual care for 3 weeks, which may include upper limb training. They will be offered AOT at home after 3 weeks. Twenty-four children with UCP will be recruited for 12 participants per group. The primary outcome will be measured using Assisting Hand Assessment. The Melbourne Assessment 2, ABILHAND, Participation and Environment Measure-Children and Youth and Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire will be included as secondary measures. Quantitative measures from sensorised objects and participants worn Actigraphs GXT3+ will be analysed. The assessment points will be the week before (T0) and after (T1) the period of AOT/standard care. Further assessments will be at T1 plus, the week after the AOT period for the waitlist group and at 8 weeks (T2) and 24 weeks (T3) after AOT training.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial has been approved by the Tuscany Paediatric Ethics Committee (169/2016).

Despite this large impact, the current clinical practice for UCP mainly includes consultative intervention or time-limited therapy following pharmacological intervention.</p><p>In the last decades, targeted UL therapies such as constraint-induced movement therapy, hand&#x02013;arm bimanual intensive training and combined approaches have emerged. Reviews on these models have clearly shown that intensive models of therapy achieves modest to strong effects to improve UL function compared with standard care&#x000a0;(SC) and that bimanual and unimanual training demonstrate similar gains in UL outcomes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref>
</p><p>In this field, one of the most recent models is the action observation training (AOT), based on the discovery of the Mirror Neuron System, whose core regions are the ventral premotor and inferior parietal cortex. These areas are activated when individuals perform goal-directed motor acts (eg, grasping an object) as well as if they simply observe the performance of the same or a similar action and trigger recruitment of the same network as the actual physical action.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> AOT is mainly based on observation of meaningful actions, and their successive imitation. AOT has been used as new intervention model in many adult studies for neurological and non-neurological diseases (such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, stroke&#x000a0;and orthopaedic surgery), and there is growing evidence of its effectiveness.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;18</xref> Recent studies carried out in children with CP indicate positive effects on UL function in younger population.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> We have recently completed a clinical study called UPper Limb Children Action observation Training&#x000a0;(UPCAT) with children with UCP based on 3 weeks of AOT, providing evidence of its efficacy in improving UL activity performance in daily activities.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To date, the UPCAT study has only been carried out in a clinical rehabilitation setting with children who were living near the two clinical centres and whose parents are willing to commit to a 3-week intensive therapy programme with consequently high costs for both health services and families. In addition, the parents, even if able to participate, found the need to attend every working day for 3&#x02009;weeks too burdensome and suggested the delivery of the intervention at home.</p><p>Biotechnologies, telerehabilitation and eHealth provide a promising approach to deliver telemonitored home programmes for a large number of participants at a relatively low cost. In this field, our group has recently experienced the design, the build and the clinical validation of new technological information and communication technologies (ICT) for providing in the first year of life telerehabilitation programmes at home for infants at risk for developing neurodevelopmental disorders<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;25</xref> In this context, similar approaches could represent viable option in providing AOT programmes at home, in a user-friendly, playful and rehabilitative setting in children. The core of AOT relies on the content of actions to be observed and on the patients&#x02019; motivation in carefully observing to imitate and actively replicate them. For these reasons, the AOT can be easily carried out at home. The present study protocol, designed as an exploratory randomised controlled&#x000a0;trial (RCT), has the purpose to investigate the feasibility of a new ICT platform, named Tele-UPCAT, to provide the UPCAT approach at home. This RCT aims to measure its efficacy in a group of children, adolescents and young adults with UCP comparing the effects of Tele-UPCAT approach (experimental group) with the SC (control group).</p><p>The primary aim will evaluate the immediate effects (T1, in the week after the end of the treatment) of this new approach (home AOT) on bimanual hand function (Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref>) and assess whether these effects will be retained at a medium-term and long-term follow-up (ie, 8 weeks&#x000a0;and 24 weeks after the end of treatment, T2 and T3). In addition, the feasibility of the Tele-UPCAT system as a comfortable, reliable and customisable tool for delivering a home AOT to UCP participants and their families will be assessed using semistructured interviews.</p><p>Secondary aims will investigate the immediate (T1) and long-term clinical effects (T2&#x000a0;and T3) on unimanual capacity (Melbourne Assessment 2 (MA 2)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and Box and Block Test (BBT)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and on bimanual daily activities at home and in the community (ABILHAND-Kids<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), participation (Participation and Environment Measure &#x02013; Children and Youth (PEM-CY))<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> and perception of quality of life (Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire (CP-QOL)).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref> Further aims will assess the feasibility of Tele-UPCAT platform on assessing, monitoring and detecting changes during and after the AOT programme by comparing the data of the clinical outcome measures with those of quantitative measurement of manual activity, obtained using sensorised objects and Tele-UPCAT platform. Finally, a cost-effective analysis will be carried out using both the perspective of the patient/caregivers and the healthcare system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The Tele-UPCAT trial is an exploratory randomised, allocation concealed (waitlist&#x000a0;controlled) and evaluator-blinded clinical trial with two investigative arms using an AOT intensive rehabilitation programme of home-based AOT compared with SC in children and young people with UCP.

In general, the training will be structured in one session per day to be executed five working days for three consecutive weeks (ie, 15 sessions in total). The duration of daily sessions will be about 1&#x02009;hour per day for a total of 15&#x02009;hours.

This consists of a computer with 23&#x02032; desktop, a dedicated software and a video camera. The OM has been obtained by integrating a large all-in-one personal computer (All-in-One touch HP Elite One 800&#x02009;G2 - L3N93AV), a large switch and a video camera (GoPro HERO Session), which will record a whole field, including subject&#x02019;s face and hands and table with objects. The OM is important to determine whether the participant is looking at the monitor during observation phase and has an overall view of the execution of actions. A dedicated software, designed after a deep and specific literature analysis, was developed for guiding and motivating participants through the phases of AOT (observation followed by execution). In addition, the software was customised for the wide age range of participants providing an interactive game with an engaging story different for every day of training for school-aged children, and a slideshow with a voiceover for adolescents and young people. The general architecture of the software is based on the following sequence: observation of a 3&#x02009;min video followed by execution of the same action for 3&#x02009;min. Subsequently, the same video will be replayed and then executed a second time. As stated before, a 60&#x02009;min session, including rest intervals, of three different goal-directed actions of increasing complexity are observed and imitated twice every day.

They differ for complexity of action and range of UL capabilities conceived in relation to HFCS levels (&#x02264;4, 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;and 7&#x02013;8).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Each series is organised into customised sequences designed to cover unimanual and bimanual UL goal-directed actions with a variety of objects and toys commonly used in routine life. For each series, experimental training is composed of 15 sets (eight unimanual followed by seven bimanual) of routine UL activities, to be completed in 3 weeks (5 days per week). Each set has a general common goal (eg, drinking a glass of water) composed of three sequential tasks of increasing complexity (eg, from picking up a bottle of water, to opening the cap, to pouring the water into a glass). As previously indicated, in order to grade the activities according to the range of capabilities, three series of sets have been planned. The actions of each series have the same goal, but the material and type of movement (ie, range of movement&#x000a0;and type of grasp) are customised in order to guarantee feasibility of the proposed activity while maintaining the same overall objective (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>). Each action of the three series performed by an actor is videotaped so that the videos show only the hand and arm from the first perspective; each video is then edited to last 3&#x02009;min. A right-handed actor uses one or two hands for unimanual and bimanual exercises, respectively, for participants with right UCP. For the left UCP, the previous videos were reversed if they maintained the same characteristic of the setting and of the hand movement, while the remaining videos were specifically

</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Clinical data will be analysed by means of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Means and SD of clinical outcome scores for both groups will be calculated to identify potential baseline differences between groups. As a first step, normality of distributions will be verified by Shapiro-Wilk&#x02019;s test. Between-group differences for all selected outcome measures will be evaluated at T0, by means of t-test for unrelated samples or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U independent sample test for normal or non-normal distributed data, respectively. To test our first hypothesis, an intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out, evaluating between-group differences (delta scores) for primary and secondary outcome measures at the primary endpoint (T1), compared with T0 (T1-T0), by means of parametric or non-parametric tests for unrelated samples. The age, HFCS level, characteristics of usual care (in both groups), supervision of caregiver&#x000a0;and acceptability of therapy (measured by semistructured interview) will be analysed for further secondary exploratory analyses (eg, regression modelling) in order to determine if some of these variables are predictive of better responses to the Tele-UPCAT training. In addition, a matched-pairs test (t-tests or Wilcoxon) will be carried out in order to assess retention of effects at follow-up periods (T1 or T1 plus, T2 and T3) relative to assessment before AOT training (T0 or T1 for experimental or waitlist group, respectively). Bonferroni corrections will not be carried out in relation to the exploratory nature of the current RCT study and the relative small number of the study sample. To detect if significant changes will correlate to HFCS levels, a correlation analysis between score changes after AOT training (T1 or T1 plus) and assessment before AOT training (T0 or T1) will be carried out. Finally, an exploratory within-group analysis will be performed for the waitlist group comparing changes during AOT with respect to those of the first&#x000a0;SC period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study protocol describes background, hypotheses, system, clinical and technological outcome measures for a RCT designed to evaluate the Tele-UPCAT system as a new approach to deliver AOT to children and young people with UCP at home.</p><p>Any deviations from the protocol will be promptly notified to the ethics committee and applied only after its approval. The trial has been registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier NCT03094455). This study protocol is reported according to the SPIRIT statement (SPIRIT 2013)<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and the TIDier guidelines.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> We anticipate that the results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and national and international academic conferences only by the professionals directly involved in the clinical trial. The results of this study will be of interest for rehabilitation trials based on AOT paradigm. Referring to a previous RCT study,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> we suggest that the home setting might increase accessibility of rehabilitation to a large number of children and young people with UCP (eg, participants that live far from the clinical centres) with a large range of hand impairments (including also participants with HFCS level lower than 6) and older age (5&#x02013;20 years instead of 5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;years). Moreover, if the Tele-UPCAT study, using a very simple ICT solution, demonstrates to be viable for delivering AOT at home with significant improvements in UL daily activities, it could lead to the application of new solution for cost-efficient rehabilitation programmes. Implementation of new smart technologies can (1) provide user-friendly AOT programmes at home; (2) remotely manage treatment by rehabilitation staff, thus increasing the ratio &#x02018;number of patients per therapist&#x02019;;&#x000a0;and (3) offer individualised and intensive training. It could become an economical and efficient rehabilitation programme by achieving significant long-lasting effects in UL activity and participation through an easily implementable paradigm that could become an integral part of common clinical practice. Finally, this approach could become a rehabilitation tool and be applicable to broader populations of CP and other chronic disabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Project status</title><p>This project began recruitment on&#x000a0;29 March 2017, and we expect to complete data collection for the last training in November 2017 and close the project in April 2018.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017819.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p>
