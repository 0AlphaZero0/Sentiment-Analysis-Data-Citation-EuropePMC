Prior structural analysis of LPLA<sub>2</sub> revealed the presence of an atypical acidic residue, Asp13, in the otherwise hydrophobic active site cleft. We hypothesized that Asp13 contributed to the pH profile and/or substrate preference of LPLA<sub>2</sub> for unsaturated acyl chains. To test this hypothesis, we substituted Asp13 for alanine, cysteine, or phenylalanine; then, we monitored the formation of 1-<italic>O</italic>-acyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetylsphingosine to measure the hydrolysis of <italic>sn</italic>-1 versus <italic>sn</italic>-2 acyl groups on a variety of glycerophospholipids. Substitutions with Asp13 yielded significant enzyme activity at neutral pH (7.4) and perturbed the selectivity for mono- and double-unsaturated acyl chains. However, this position played no apparent role in selecting for either the acyl acceptor or the head group of the glycerophospholipid. Our modeling indicates that Asp13 and its substitutions contribute to the pH activity profile of LPLA<sub>2</sub> and to acyl chain selectivity by forming part of a hydrophobic track occupied by the scissile acyl chain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acyltransferase</kwd><kwd>1-<italic>O</italic>-acylceramide</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group XV</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>selectivity</kwd><kwd>pH dependence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/100000002</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">AR056991</award-id><award-id rid="sp1">HL071818</award-id><award-id rid="sp1">HL122416</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>F32 Ruth L.

It has broad substrate specificity, recognizing several glycerophospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. In the presence of lipophilic alcohols, such as N-acetyl-sphingosine (NAS), LPLA<sub>2</sub> acts as an acyltransferase, generating <italic>O</italic>-linked acyl alcohols. If no acceptor other than water is present, LPLA<sub>2</sub> acts as a phospholipase and only a lysophospholipid and a free fatty acid are formed.</p><p>LPLA<sub>2</sub> is localized to late endosomes and lysosomes and, like other lysosomal hydrolases, has an acidic pH optimum. LPLA<sub>2</sub> null mice are characterized by the early development of increased surfactant phospholipid levels and alveolar macrophage foam cells, similar to that observed in drug-induced phospholipidosis (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Other studies have identified a role for LPLA<sub>2</sub> in host defense (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The acidic pH is important for the binding of the enzyme to liposomes or membranes and is mediated through a distinct membrane binding domain (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This binding domain may be the basis by which LPLA<sub>2</sub> mediates amiodarone-associated phospholipidosis (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the enzyme is active against water-soluble truncated oxidized phospholipids at neutral pH (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), suggesting that some substrates may directly access the catalytic domain, and that there may be a biological role for secreted LPLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>In an earlier study, the specificities of LPLA<sub>2</sub> toward <italic>sn</italic>-1 versus <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acyl groups were evaluated by separating and identifying distinct species of 1-<italic>O</italic>-acyl-ceramides formed as the product of its lipase and transacylase reactions (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We reported that both <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acyl groups of phosphatidylcholine were subject to hydrolysis depending on the fatty acyl species present, with preference for unsaturated acyl chains, which are typically found at the <italic>sn-</italic>2 position of phospholipids. However, at the time of that study, the structure of LPLA<sub>2</sub> had not yet been discovered and thus, the molecular basis for fatty acid selectivity was unknown.</p><p>Recently, our groups reported the structure of LPLA<sub>2</sub> and LCAT, a structurally related phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> with transacylase activity (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The crystal structure confirmed that the catalytic core of LPLA<sub>2</sub> is an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase domain but with distinct membrane binding and &#x0201c;cap&#x0201d; domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). The catalytic triad and adjacent oxyanion hole are found at the base of a largely hydrophobic bowl that is at least partially shielded from solvent by a loop that extends from the cap domain, and is the binding site for glycerophospholipids and lipophilic alcohols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Both the lipase and acyltransferase reactions of LPLA<sub>2</sub> proceed sequentially with the transient acylation of the catalytic serine by the scissile fatty acyl group. The same lipid binding pocket is anticipated to be used for the departing lysophospholipid product and the ultimate lipophilic alcohol that serves as an acyl group acceptor.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>LPLA<sub>2</sub> tertiary structure.

B: The proposed locations of tracks A and B are shown in relation to the catalytic serine Ser165 and Asp13, a position typically conserved as a large hydrophobic residue in other related lipases.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1205fig1"/></fig><p>Based on these structures, substrate modeling, and the position of disease-causing mutations in LCAT (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we proposed that the orientation of the bound phospholipid in the active site underlies the specificity of LPLA<sub>2</sub> for fatty acids in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 vs. the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position. We further proposed that the observed acyl chain length preference of LPLA<sub>2</sub> is determined by two hydrophobic grooves, termed the A and B tracks, leading away from the catalytic triad of the enzyme, with the A track likely to be that occupied by the scissile acyl chain.</p><p>Asp13 is a conspicuous residue located next to the oxyanion hole and contributes to the A track in a position typically conserved as hydrophobic residue (M/V/L) in type I lipases (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The analogous residue in LCAT is Cys31, which is also atypical. We hypothesized that the pH 4.5 optimum of LPLA<sub>2</sub> in part reflects the requirement for protonation of this side chain at low pH, resulting in its neutralization, and allowing acyl chains to bind in this track. We further hypothesized that Asp13 contributes to substrate preference for unsaturated acyl chains.</p><p>These hypotheses were tested by substituting Asp13 for Ala (D13A), Cys (D13C), or Phe (D13F) and by the measurement of transacylase and lipase activities as a function of pH. We observed that the D13F variant exhibits significantly less pH dependence with an observed augmention of phosholipase A activity at pH 7.4. We also observed a role for Asp13 in acceptor specificity with regard to unsaturated fatty acyl groups independent of their <italic>sn</italic>-1 vs. <italic>sn</italic>-2 positions. These studies further confirmed that the scissile fatty acyl group resides in track A and confers either phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> activity based on the affinity of the fatty acyl group for this track.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>1,2-Dipalmitoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-distearoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-oleoyl-2-myristoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OMPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexanoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PDPC), 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OPPC), 1-oleoyl-2-steraroyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OSPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-(1&#x02032;rac-rlycero) Na salt (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC), 1- oleoyl -2-stearoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OSPC), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SLPC), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphate (SLPA), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (SOPE), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (SOPS), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphate (SOPA), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-(1&#x02032;rac-glycerol) (SOPG), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphate (SLPA), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-(1&#x02032;rac-glycerol) (SLPG), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (SLPS), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (SLPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PSPC), <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-<italic>erythro</italic>-sphingosine (NAS), 1,2-di-<italic>O</italic>-octadecenyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DODPC), 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (HAG) were purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL).

When liposomes containing SOPC, SOPE, SOPS, SOPG, or SOPA/sulfatide/NAS (10:1:3 molar ratio) were used at pH 4.5 as the acyl donor for either WT or D13F variants, both 1-<italic>O</italic>-stereoyl-NAS and 1-<italic>O</italic>-oleoyl-NAS were formed (supplemental Fig. S2). The best acyl donors were SOPS, and SOPG, likely due to the increased negative charge of their respective liposomes. Notably, the D13F variant exhibited more selectivity for 1-<italic>O</italic>-oleoyl-NAS (supplemental Fig. S2B, D), perhaps due to steric constraints imposed on Track A by its bulkier side chain. When the reaction was performed at pH 7.4, only SOPG and SOPA exhibited measurable activity with WT (supplemental Fig. S3A, B), but the D13F variant regained activity against all tested phospholipids, suggesting that this variant exhibits stronger interactions with its substrates in general, perhaps through increased acyl chain interactions but also possibly because there is no charge repulsion between Asp13 and the phosphate in the head group. When POPC, POPE, POPG, POPS and POPA/sulfatide/NAS (10:1:3 molar ratio) were used as acyl donors at pH 4.5, POPS, POPC, and POPG were the preferred substrates. Thus, the selectivity of LPLA<sub>2</sub> for <italic>sn</italic>-1, and <italic>sn</italic>-2 position does not depend on a head group. However, the rate of hydrolysis is dependent on the phospholipid head group.</p></sec><sec><title>Acylation of HAG, HG, and other biosynthetic lipophilic alcohols by the D13F variant</title><p>NAS is not the only acceptor for LPLA<sub>2</sub> transacylation. Other acceptors include ethanol derivatives with one long aliphatic chain and one short neutral residue, such as methyl or acyl group in the C2 position (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A number of natural and synthetic lipophilic alcohols that have similar structure to NAS were tested to determine whether they could serve as the acceptor in the transacylase reaction of LPLA<sub>2</sub> and whether the D13F variant has impact on selectivity. HAG is an alkylacylglycerol with a primary alcohol group at the C3 position and is structurally very similar to NAS. When liposomes consisting of DOPC/sulfatide/HAG were used, two products were formed, oleic acid and 1-<italic>O</italic>-hexadecyl-2-3-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol at either pH 4.5 or 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold>, B</xref>).

Similar to HAG, we did not observe major differences in the products or their ratios between WT and the D13F variant at pH 4.5 (data not shown). As with NAS as an acceptor, the D13F variant was also able to acylate all lipophilic alcohols at pH 7.4. Therefore, the D13F variant showed no effect on the acceptor selectivity and this position is seeming unlikely to contribute to the acceptor binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular mechanisms for LPLA<sub>2</sub> substrate selectivity</title><p>Our previously reported data (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and the data presented herein shows that LPLA<sub>2</sub> can cleave both <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acyl groups on a variety of glycerophospholipids, and largely does so independent of the head group and the acyl acceptor, with preference typically given to the more unsaturated acyl chain, provided there are not four or more unsaturated positions (supplemental Fig. S1). Substitution of Asp13 seems to have little impact on this selectivity other than to impart additional bias against saturated acyl chains in the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and supplemental Fig. S2). Based on these data, we modeled phospholipids with either <italic>sn</italic>-1 or <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acyl groups in track A for each of the phospholipids that are substrates for the lipase. SOPC and OSPC were docked into D13F variant in order to demonstrate that it is possible for the unsaturated acyl chain (oleoyl) to serve as the donor for transacylation regardless of its <italic>sn</italic>-1 or <italic>sn</italic>-2 attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8"><bold>Fig. 8A</bold>, B</xref>). During transacylation, the chain located in track A forms an acyl intermediate with Ser165. Indeed, docking showed that when the unsaturated chain is oriented in track A. The <italic>cis</italic> double bond creates a kink in the lipid tail to curve around the side chain of Asp13. Having a phenylalanine in place of an aspartate would allow for additional &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interactions between the aromatic ring and double-bond, potentially explaining why the D13F variant preferentially transfers the oleoyl acyl chain regardless of whether it is in the <italic>sn</italic>-1 or <italic>sn</italic>-2 position. Docking with SLPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8C</xref>) suggests that the additional double bond of the linoleoyl chain will also be able to form additional van der Waals interactions with Phe13.</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>A: Overall fold of LPLA<sub>2</sub> showing the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase (yellow with orange &#x003b2;-sheets), membrane binding (magenta), and cap (purple) domains.

WT only shows a slight preference for the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position, perhaps because Asp13 makes more limited interactions with the acyl chain in track A. Docking of lipid substrates with various head groups was also performed (supplemental Fig. S4). In each case, the phosphate groups of the head group aligned very closely and formed interactions with conserved residues Lys202 and Arg212 (and in most cases Thr329). Beyond that the remainder of the head group formed minimal interactions with the protein. Therefore, we expect that the interactions with the head group and enzyme should not influence the substrate specificity, consistent with our results. Rather, other physical properties of liposomes that are controlled by the head group are likely to play a dominant role. This might include electrostatic interactions between anionic phospholipids and cationic residues on the enzyme (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and alterations in the phase properties of the bilayer.</p><fig id="f9" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Docking of SOPC into LPLA2 WT.

The esterification of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids typically occurs at the <italic>sn</italic>-1-position whereas unsaturated fatty acids are generally restricted to the <italic>sn</italic>-2-position. Although the composition of phospholipids may be determined in part by de novo synthetic pathways, remodeling of membranes by phospholipases and acyl-CoA:lysophospholipases is also important in maintaining this asymmetry (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The basis by which enzymes can distinguish between saturated and unsaturated acyl chains has thus been the subject of considerable attention (<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Phospholipases are defined as A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> based on their ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of <italic>sn</italic>-1 versus <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acyl groups. Many PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes display strict specificity toward the <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acyl group based on the lyso-lipid formed. However, because acyl groups may migrate between hydroxyl groups on lyso-lipids, strict proof of the fatty acyl specificity of many PLA<sub>2</sub> family members is often lacking. Because LPLA<sub>2</sub> is both a phospholipase and transacylase, the determination of which acyl group represents the scissile fatty acid can be unambiguously determined due to the ability to distinguish between the 1-<italic>O</italic>-acyl-ceramides formed.</p><p>Our current studies of an unusual charged amino acid found in the active site of LPLA<sub>2</sub> demonstrate that this residue, Asp13, has the ability to tune the activity of the enzyme via its protonation state. When this fatty acid is substituted with a phenylalanine, the pH dependence is less pronounced and both phospholipase and transacylase activities can be observed at pH 7.4 with DOPC as the substrate. Because the activity of WT and D13F LPLA<sub>2</sub> are essentially the same at pH 4.5, the boost in activity observed at higher pH with D13F is unlikely due to additional interactions formed by the phenylalanine side chain with phospholipid substrates.</p><p>Our biochemical and modeling results also show that the residue at position 13, whose side chain contributes to track A, is also able to tune acyl chain preference, likely through direct interactions with the acyl chain, consistent with our prediction that the scissile fatty acyl group always resides in track A of the enzyme. When the unsaturated acyl chain is in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position, D13F variant enhances selectivity for transfer of the unsaturated chain. Conversely, D13F is less selective than WT for unsaturated acyl chains when they are in the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>). Although modeling indicates that phospholipids can dock with either acyl chain in track A, the molecular basis for the opposing effects of D13F on selectivity for unsaturated acyl chains is unclear.</p><p>Our data shows that the identity of residue 13 does not seem to influence selectivity for acyl acceptors or the phospholipid head group. The former result is somewhat surprising given its proximity to the acyl transfer site. The head group of the glycerophospholipid, on the other hand, docks relatively far away from Asp13. Electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate group common to all phospholipids and deprotonated Asp13 may, however, also contribute to its lower activity at high pH.</p><p>The closely related enzyme LCAT has a cysteine instead of aspartate in the analogous position (Cys31). This is the most prominent difference between LCAT and LPLA<sub>2</sub> in the active site other than the dynamic lid that partially covers the hydrophobic bowl of the active site. However, neither the D13C substitution nor the D13C substitution along with other conservative changes in the active site (ToLCC) were as adept as D13F in recovering acyltransferase activity at neutral pH where LCAT is the most active (although D13C did have low measurable activity). D13C and ToLCC were also unable to demonstrate activity against a cholesterol-like substrate in a synthetic HDL-based activity assay. These results, along with a lack of obvious effects on acyl acceptor identity with the D13F variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), indicate that acyl acceptor preference may be most strongly dictated by the dynamic lid element in the LCAT/LPLA<sub>2</sub> family. Conversely, their selectivity for glycerophospholipid substrates is strongly dictated by interactions by features within the active site cavity, including track A and the identity of the residue at position 31/13, respectively, with the acyl chains.</p></sec>
