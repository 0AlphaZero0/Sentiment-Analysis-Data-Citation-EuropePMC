Some HF patients present changes in the musculoskeletal system and inspiratory muscle weakness, which may be restored by inspiratory muscle training, thus increasing respiratory muscle strength and endurance, maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>), functional capacity, respiratory responses to exercise, and quality of life. Yoga therapies have been shown to improve quality of life, inflammatory markers, and peak VO<sub>2</sub> mostly in HF patients with a reduced ejection fraction. However, the effect of different yoga breathing techniques in patients showing HF with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remain to be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">A PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded end-point) parallel-group trial will be conducted at two specialized HF clinics.

After signing informed consent and performing a pre-test intervention, patients will be randomized into three groups and provided with either (1) active yoga breathing techniques; (2) passive yoga breathing techniques (pranayama); or and (3) control (standard pharmacological treatment). Follow-up will last 8 weeks (16 sessions). The post-intervention tests will be performed at the end of the intervention period for analysis of outcomes. Interventions will occur continuously according to patients&#x02019; enrollment. The main outcome is respiratory muscular resistance. A total of 33 enrolled patients are expected.

Some studies have focused on the role of maximal inspiratory pressure (PI<sub>max</sub>) and inspiratory muscle endurance, which have been associated to low quality of life (QoL) and worse clinical prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial with HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and inspiratory muscle weakness (IMW), inspiratory muscle training markedly improved inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, incrementing submaximal and maximal functional capacity as well as QoL. In addition, heart rate variability (HRV) is also decreased by cardiovascular diseases and might result either from a direct central up-regulation of cardiovagal activity, or as a secondary effect of baroreceptor activation, or changes in respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">However, respiration has not been emphasized, despite evidence that breathing characteristics (rate and amplitude) markedly affect beat-to-beat cardiovascular variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Within this context, yoga breathing might combine abdominal, thoracic, and clavicular breathing phases in order to maximize breathing volume and therefore increase oxygen uptake. It has been reported that very and moderately slow yoga breathing creates a significant change in HRV frequency bands along and after exercise in healthy men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, a study reported the comparative effectiveness of several forms of lifestyle modifications and found smoking cessation and yoga to be the most effective forms of cardiovascular disease prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, yoga techniques without breathing control have shown to improve oxygen uptake in patients showing HF, especially HFrEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, even considering that almost half of HF patients show heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF), few studies have been performed with such patients. It has been recently demonstrated that HFpEF induces significant molecular, mitochondrial, histological, and functional alterations in the diaphragm and soleus, which were attenuated by exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">With respect to cardiovascular disease and aging, several authors have shown a significant reduction of HR variability in the frequency ranges associated with breathing by using spectral analysis of HR and respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, the present randomized clinical trial will be conducted primarily in order to test the hypothesis that an 8-week program of yoga and specific breathing techniques with various respiratory rhythms might be associated with improved inspiratory muscle responses. Secondly, changes in functional capacity, oxygen uptake efficiency slope, circulatory power, oscillatory ventilation, oxygen uptake kinetics in the recovery period, distinct features of the autonomic nervous system, natriuretic peptides, echocardiographic measurements, and QoL will be assessed in HFpEF patients, both with and without IMW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par24">A PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded end-point) parallel-group trial with three groups will be conducted at two specialized HF clinics (HF Clinic at Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), RS, Brazil, and the HF ambulatory at Hospital ULBRA-M&#x000e3;e de Deus, Canoas, RS, Brazil).

Briefly, time domain and frequency domain analyses of HRV will be performed according to the recommended by the European Society of Cardiology and North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For time domain analysis, the following 24-h indices will be calculated: mean of all normal inter-beat (RR) intervals, standard deviation of all normal RR intervals, root mean square of successive differences of adjacent RR intervals, and rate of successive differences between normal adjacent RR intervals above 50&#x000a0;ms. For frequency domain analysis, the following spectral components will be calculated: low frequency (0.04&#x02013;0.15&#x000a0;Hz), high frequency (0.15&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;Hz), and low-to-high frequency ratio. Spectral components will be expressed in absolute values (ms<sup>2</sup> Hz) and in normalized units. Heart rate spectral analysis and time domain indices will be calculated using 5-min segments at rest during active breathing (<italic>ujjayi</italic>) and passive breathing (<italic>pran&#x000e0;yama).</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>BNP and NT-proBNP</title><p id="Par42">Since this trial will be performed at two centers, both BNP or NT-proBNP methods will be used, yet the same biomarker (either BNP or NT-proBNP) will be employed for pre- and post-tests in any given patient. The BNP test will be performed on the clinical specimen using blood serum and a chemiluminescence analysis method (Advia Centaursiemens). The NT-proBNP test will be performed on a clinical specimen using blood serum and a sandwich-type electrochemiluminescence analysis method (Cobas E601-Roche).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Echocardiography</title><p id="Par43">Usual and additional echocardiographic measures, such as volumetric gradients and diastolic parameters, will be analyzed in the selection of eligible patients (ejection fraction calculated by Teichholz method, &#x02265;&#x02009;50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and after intervention by using two-dimensional echocardiograms (Philips IEE 33).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par44">Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study; those who accept to participate will sign a written informed consent form. Following the conclusion of pre-intervention tests, the researcher will inform the biostatistics center at HCPA, which is in charge of the randomization list, and participants will be allocated to either yoga (active) or yoga (passive) or control group in a 1:1:1 ratio using a pre-generated simple randomization list.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sociodemographic and clinical variables</title><p id="Par45">A structured questionnaire will be filled by all study participants to collect sociodemographic data and clinical parameters (age, sex, education, current occupation or previous occupation when retired, daily routine, etiology and HF duration, presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation and aortic or mitral valve disease, history of smoking and alcohol intake, medications, hospitalizations, previous illnesses, presence of angina, stent placements, history of acute myocardial infarction, NYHA functional class, echocardiographic data).

The treatment groups will be compared using the generalized estimating equation, specific for repeated measurements, in order to compare the effects (means) across the three groups and the two times, in addition to the group &#x000d7; time interaction. The generalized estimating equation matrix of robust estimator covariance and exchangeable work correlation matrix will be used if normal distribution is found and will be analyzed by an identity binding function. In contrast, if an asymmetrical distribution is found, data will be analyzed using a gamma distribution linked to a logarithmic function. When significant, the factors under study will be compared by Bonferroni&#x02019;s post-hoc test. Correlations will be described by the Pearson&#x02019;s or Spearman&#x02019;s test. The PASW18 (version 18.0, SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) will be used in this analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">Patients showing HFpEF have poor functional capacity despite preserved systolic function, and little has been added to the treatment of those patients. Recent research indicates that patients with restrictive ventilation, poor functional capacity, or peripheral abnormalities have more symptoms of exercise intolerance. Therapeutic strategies are necessary to improve exercise tolerance by targeting the integrated functions of these systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Traditionally, yoga is a complex physical practice associated with specific respiratory techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Currently, it has been recommended in risk reduction programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and cardiovascular rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and its benefits include well-being, cognitive and motor improvement, positive effects in the treatment of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], decreasing inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and improved functional capacity of HFrEF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In HFpEF patients, there are scarce reports based on the functional and neuromuscular properties during an acute or adaptive response to physical yoga and/or breathing practices.</p><p id="Par54">This trial will assess the effects of yoga and specific breathing techniques as a non-pharmacological intervention in order to improve patients with HFpEF by promoting a decrease in the dyspnea degree during rest and exercise intolerance, which may represent a new treatment possibility for those patients. To this end, the NYHA classification will be assessed.</p><p id="Par55">In order to reduce trial bias, this study has been carefully designed according to the PROBE concept&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], in which patients will be randomly allocated into intervention groups in a researcher-independent way, since the statistics department in the HCPA facility has a central phone for randomization.
