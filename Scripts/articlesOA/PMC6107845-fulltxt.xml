Human respiratory paramyxoviruses, for example parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), are common causes of respiratory diseases both in infants and a subset of adults. HPIV3 recognizes sialic acid (SA)-containing receptors on host cells. In contrast to human influenza viruses which have a preference for &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid, HPIV3 preferentially recognize &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids. Group B streptococci (GBS) are colonizers in the human respiratory tract. They contain a capsular polysaccharide with terminal sialic acid residues in an &#x003b1;2,3-linkage. In the present study, we report that HPIV3 can recognize the &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids present on GBS. The interaction was evident not only by the binding of virions to GBS in a co-sedimentation assay, but also in the GBS binding to HPIV3-infected cells. While co-infection by GBS and HPIV3 had a delaying effect on the virus replication, it enhanced GBS adherence to virus-infected cells. To show that other human paramyxoviruses are also able to recognize the capsular sialic acid of GBS we demonstrate that GBS attaches in a sialic acid-dependent way to transfected BHK cells expressing the HN protein of mumps virus (MuV) on their surface. Overall, our results reveal a new type of synergism in the co-infection by respiratory pathogens, which is based on the recognition of &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids. This interaction between human paramyxoviruses and GBS enhances the bacterial adherence to airway cells and thus may result in more severe disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sialic acids</kwd><kwd>hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein</kwd><kwd>parainfluenza virus</kwd><kwd>mumps virus</kwd><kwd>group B streptococci</kwd><kwd>co-infection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">He1168/15-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">He1168/19-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">Va2391/7-1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">China Scholarship Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004543</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">201608080211</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6565"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) were first isolated in the late 1950s from children sick with lower respiratory diseases. The virus differed from influenza viruses of the family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> by a non-segmented genome (Numazaki et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>) and therefore, was assigned to a different virus family, <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>. (Burton, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1964</xref>; Cooney et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>), HPIV3 causes acute respiratory infections (ARI) worldwide that are associated with a mortality of nearly 20% in children under 5 years-old (Glezen et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). HPIV has become one of the most threatening childhood infectious agents around the world due to insufficient vaccines or treatments (Counihan et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Moscona, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Garg et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>HPIV3 and some other viruses of the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> share the common feature of recognizing sialic acid (SA)-containing receptors on host cells (Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein and the fusion (F) protein, are involved in the initial steps of viral-cell interactions (Moscona and Peluso, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Porotto et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). For optimal infection conditions, a balanced interaction between the sialic acid binding activity and the neuraminidase activity of the HN protein is essential (Tappert et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). HPIV3, the clinically most prevalent HPIV subtype, recognizes &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids in branched and unbranched oligosaccharides present on either glycoproteins or glycolipids (Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Most efficient binding was observed with a sialylated tetrasaccharide (Amonsen et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Mumps virus (MuV), another paramyxovirus, has recently been reported to use a trisaccharide containing &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid in unbranched sugar chains as a receptor determinant (Kubota et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some strains especially neurovirulent variants may show an increased binding activity for &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (Reyes-Leyva et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). With respect to the sialic acid binding activity, the human paramyxoviruses HPIV3 and MuV differ from human influenza viruses which have a clear preference for the &#x003b1;2,6 linkage (Rogers and Paulson, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>).</p><p>In the complex microenvironment of the human respiratory tract, different kinds of microorganisms may synergistically interact with each other resulting in viral-bacterial co-infections that are often associated with more severe disease than the respective mono-infections (Beadling and Slifka, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Franz et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Apart from influenza A viruses, paramyxoviruses including HPIV also have been frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia in humans (Korppi et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Juv&#x000e9;n et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Among the bacterial pathogens involved in respiratory co-infections, streptococci play a prominent role and <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> being a well-known representative. Group B streptococci (GBS, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>), the causative agent of infant meningitis and pneumonia in non-pregnant adults have been found to colonize the human airway epithelium (Fallon and Sonnenwirth, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Christensen et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Doran et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In a previous study, we demonstrated that GBS is able to interact with influenza viruses which have a preference for avian type receptors (&#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids). Streptococcal binding to the influenza hemagglutinin expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells enhances the bacterial adhesion and invasion properties (Tong et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, avian influenza viruses only occasionally infect humans (Stevens et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Shi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In contrast to human influenza viruses which have a preference for &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid, human paramyxoviruses recognize &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid. Therefore we analyzed the interactions between GBS and a human paramyxovirus, HPIV3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells, viruses, bacteria and plasmids</title><p>Human laryngeal carcinoma epithelial cells (HEp-2, ATCC&#x000ae; CCL-23&#x02122;) were maintained in MEM Eagle's Medium (EMEM, CytoGen AG, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Millipore AG, Germany) and 2 mM stable L-glutamine.

The supernatants were analyzed for the presence of virus by determining (i) the HA activity with 1% guinea pig erythrocytes (gpRBC, Dune Lab, Germany) and (ii) the infectivity by virus titration on HEp-2 cells. The bacteria pellets were washed three times with cold PBS containing antibiotics (200 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin) before determining the infectivity by plaque assays on HEp-2 cells.

In contrast to human influenza viruses, HPIV3 utilizes &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor determinant for binding to and infection of cells (Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Therefore, we were interested whether this virus is able to interact with encapsulated GBS in a sialic acid-dependent manner. In a co-sedimentation experiment, HPIV3 was incubated for 1 h with either GBS or, as a control, with <italic>S. suis</italic>. The latter bacterium contains a similar capsular polysaccharide as does GBS, but differs in the terminal sialic acid residue which is attached in an &#x003b1;2,6 rather than in an &#x003b1;2,3-linkage (Charland et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Van Calsteren et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Bacteria were sedimented by low-speed centrifugation and the supernatants were analyzed for the presence of virus. The infectivity titer was not affected by the presence of <italic>S. suis</italic>. However, a reduction by about 50% was determined for the sample containing GBS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The amount of virus remaining in the supernatant could not be further decreased by increasing the amount of bacteria (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>). When the presence of virus was analyzed by HA titration, a four-fold reduction was obtained for the sample containing GBS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). It is not clear why a substantial amount of virus remained in the supernatant. Possible reasons may be related: (i) to the centrifugation procedure, (ii) to the presence of a viral subpopulation that recognizes the capsular sialic acid only with low affinity, (iii) to the fact that in the case of paramyxoviruses &#x02014;in contrast to influenza viruses - the sialic acid binding and the neuraminidase activity are located on the same surface protein (HN) which may make it more difficult to control the sialidase activity; or (iv) to a combination of the above reasons. To get direct evidence for the presence of virus in the pellet fraction, the sediment was suspended and subjected to plaque assays. The highest infectivity titer was found in the pellet fraction obtained after co-sedimentation of HPIV3 and GBS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We further analyzed whether bound virus can elute from GBS. The GBS-HPIV3 mixtures were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by sedimentation of bacteria by low-speed centrifugation. After suspension of the sedimented bacteria, HA titration indicated that a substantial amount of virus had eluted from bacteria after 40 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The viral neuraminidase activity of the HN protein was sufficient for this effect (green line, indicated as HPIV+GBS), because elution could not be enhanced by addition of exogenous bacterial neuraminidase [orange line, indicated as (HPIV+GBS) + NA].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>HA activity and infectivity of HPIV3 after co-sedimention with GBS or <italic>S. suis</italic>.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, most fluorescent signals for bound bacteria (green) were found in the sample co-infected by HPIV3 and GBS, and all adherent bacteria were associated with virus-infected cells (red).

Desialylation of bacteria by prior neuraminidase-treatment reduced the number of bound bacteria to a value close to that determined for the GBS-mono-infected sample. <italic>S. suis</italic> was less efficient in binding to cells than was GBS, and the number of cell-associated bacteria was not significantly increased when cells were pre-infected by HPIV3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, HPIV3 infection enhanced the adherence of GBS to HEp-2 cells in a sialic acid-dependent manner.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Immunofluorescence analysis of streptococcal attachment to HPIV3-infected cells.

After removal of non-adherent bacteria, cells were further incubated and at different time points aliquots were taken for virus titration.

To analyze whether the glycoproteins of MuV can recognize the capsular sialic acid of GBS, BHK-21 cells were transfected for expression of the MuV-HN protein on the cell surface. Bacterial adherence was determined by incubation with GBS for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> (top panels), a large number of green fluorescent signals indicated the presence of GBS adhering to MuV-HN expressing cells. The adherence of the bacteria was dependent on the &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids in the capsular polysaccharide, because a much lower number of fluorescent signals was detected when GBS had been pretreated with neuraminidase or when GBS was replaced by <italic>S. suis</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) which contains &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acids in its capsular polysaccharide. To get further evidence for the binding of the MuV-HN protein to GBS, we performed a hemadsorption assay. Consistent with previous reports that MuV agglutinates guinea pig erythrocytes, these red blood cells specifically attached to HN-expressing BHK-21 cells (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,C</xref>). In the presence of GBS, adherence of the erythrocytes was substantially reduced (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,D</xref>). No inhibitory effect was detected when <italic>S. suis</italic> was applied (shown only in the bar chart, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). These results confirm that the MuV glycoproteins interact with GBS in a manner that is dependent on the &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids of the capsular polysaccharide. This method can also be applied to the glycoproteins of other paramyxoviruses that are less well characterized. When there is an indication that infection by the respective virus is enhanced by GBS, the analysis has to proceed from the stage of transfected cells to the stage of virus-infected cells.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Immunofluorescence analysis of streptococcal attachment to HN-expressing cells.

The binding of the respective viral proteins to the sugar alone, N-acetylneuraminic acid, is characterized by a low affinity. The binding to the cell surface receptors occurs with higher affinity because viruses recognize the terminal sialic acid as part of the larger oligosaccharide motif present on glycoproteins or glycolipids. The interaction with viral proteins is dependent not only on the type of sialic acid but also on other factors, e.g., the linkage to the neighboring sugar which most often is galactose (Matrosovich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Influenza viruses are well-known for their differential interaction with sialic acid; thus, avian viruses recognize &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid and human viruses prefer &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (Rogers and Paulson, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Connor et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). This binding specificity is not observed on human paramyxoviruses (Moscona and Peluso, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Most members of the genera <italic>Respirovirus</italic>, including HPIV3, and <italic>Rubulavirus</italic>, including MuV, appear to attach to glycoconjugates containing &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid, though some strains/variants have been reported to recognize &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (Reyes-Leyva et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kubota et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Whereas the recognition of &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid is a common feature of human paramyxoviruses, differences have been reported with respect to the neighboring sugars. The binding affinity may depend on whether the glycan is branched or unbranched, or whether the following sugars are modified by sulfate groups or fucose residues (Amonsen et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In this way the viruses may interact with a broader or with a narrower spectrum of glycan structures, and therefore they may also differ in the spectrum of target cells.</p><p>Because of the considerations mentioned above, it was not possible to predict whether HPIV3 and MuV glycoproteins are able to interact with GBS. The capsular polysaccharide of this microorganism contains a rhamnose residue that is not found in glycoconjugates of vertebrate cells. Glycan arrays used to characterize the binding activity of viral proteins usually do not include glycans with a rhamnose. Our results demonstrate that the rhamnose residue does not affect the conformation of the respective glycan structure in a way that prevents the recognition by either HPIV3 or MuV. In fact, the interaction of the two paramyxoviruses with GBS occurs with the same sialic acid specificity as does the interplay between these viruses and their host cells. Viral-bacterial co-sedimentation or bacterial adherence to HN-expressing cells was observed only with GBS which contains &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid, but not with <italic>S. suis</italic> which has a similar capsular polysaccharide but differs in the terminal sialic acid which is present in an &#x003b1;2,6-linkage (Van Calsteren et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The binding of the paramyxoviruses to GBS appears to occur with similar affinity as does the interaction with cell surface receptors. This conclusion is based on our finding that GBS is able to inhibit the hemadsorption activity of the MuV-HN protein competitively. Efficient attachment of influenza and paramyxoviruses to the cell surface depends not only on the specific recognition of cellular receptors, but also on the establishment of multiple binding sites. Multivalent interactions between viruses and cells can be achieved because a virion contains hundreds of surface glycoproteins and cells usually expose a large number of sialylated glycan motifs on their surface. In our case, multivalent interactions can also be achieved with GBS because this microorganism contains many &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acids in the capsule.</p><p>Recently we reported that co-infection of cells by avian influenza viruses and GBS results in a delay of the viral replication (Tong et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A similar result was obtained in the present study with HPIV3. This negative effect may be due to binding of bacteria to virus infected-cells which may delay the budding process and virus egress. An alternative explanation is that binding of bacteria to virions released from infected cells may impede virus entry into uninfected cells and thus delay the spread of infection.</p><p>Whereas viral-bacterial co-infection had a negative effect on the replication of HPIV3, adherence of GBS was greatly enhanced. Several components of GBS have been described to mediate the adherence to host factors (for a review see Wang et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Most important for binding to and colonization of epithelial cells appear to be the adhesins BsaB, HvgA, the Alpha C proteins (ACP), the serine-rich repeat (Srr) proteins as well as the pili. We do not know which of these proteins is involved in the adherence of GBS to HEp-2 cells, but our results show that sialic acid-mediated binding to HN proteins exposed on the cell surface is a more efficient way of adherence. Previously, sialic acids of GBS have mainly been associated with immune evasion by interaction with lectins on immune cells which prevents complement activation and counteracts the bactericidal activity of the host cells (Chang et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Landwehr-Kenzel and Henneke, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the capsular sialic acids of GBS enhance the adherence to paramyxovirus-infected cells which is consistent with our recent report that the HA proteins of avian influenza viruses expressed on infected cells enhance the adhesion properties of GBS. As shown with influenza virus-infected cells, enhanced adherence is paralleled by enhanced invasion. GBS is a commensal bacterium that asymptomatically colonizes mucosal surfaces. To cause disease, the microorganism has to invade the host. Therefore, via increased adherence and invasion, co-infection with influenza viruses or paramyxoviruses that recognize &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid may contribute to the severity of disease caused by GBS. It will be interesting in the future, to see how co-infection by GBS and HPIV3 contributes to viral/bacterial replication and pathogenesis in a small animal model.</p><p>Mumps virus infections are limited in developed countries because of vaccination programmes. Therefore, information about bacterial co-infections is lacking. However, they may play a role in developing countries. Furthermore, our results show that sialic acid-dependent interactions with GBS are not limited to HPIV3 but can occur also with other viruses, and this type of interaction can also be demonstrated by a different method, i.e., with transfected cells. The latter approach may be interesting for viruses that are difficult to amplify in cell cultures.</p><p>Another streptococcal partner for viral bacterial co-infections is <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This pathogen contains a neuraminidase to release sialic acid from the cell surface and therefore does not contain sialic acid residues in the capsular polysaccharide. In co-infections with influenza viruses, it may also use the viral neuraminidase for desialylation purposes. It will be interesting in the future to compare the strategies of GBS and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to increase the adherence and invasion, the sialic acid-dependent interaction of GBS and the neuraminidase-based strategy of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>GH and PV-W conceived and designed the study.
