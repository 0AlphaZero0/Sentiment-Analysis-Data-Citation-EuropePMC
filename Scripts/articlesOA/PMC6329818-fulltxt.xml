As opposed to the idea that the sexual dichotomy in transcriptional profiles produced by a sex-specific factor underlies such sex differences, we discovered that the sex-specific cleavage confers the activity as a sexual-fate inducer on the pleiotropic transcription factor Longitudinals lacking (Lola). Surprisingly, Fruitless, another transcription factor with a master regulator role for courtship circuitry formation, directly binds to Lola to protect its cleavage in males. We also show that Lola cleavage involves E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin1 and 26S proteasome. Our work adds a new dimension to the study of sex-specific behavior and its circuit basis by unveiling a mechanistic link between proteolysis and the sexually dimorphic patterning of circuits.

These differences in behavioral patterns are the outcome of the intersex differences in neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has well been documented that sexual dimorphisms in neural circuits result, in principle, from sex differences in the number, structure and function of individual cells composing the circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The development of these cellular sex differences relies primarily on either or both of two sex determination genes, <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>) and <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, it is largely unknown how <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> produce sex differences in individual cells. We discovered that the <italic>longitudinals lacking</italic> (<italic>lola</italic>) gene is an essential mediator for the <italic>fru</italic> action to masculinize the mAL cell structure. The <italic>lola</italic> locus generates extraordinarily large numbers of mRNA variants (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), each of which encodes a unique protein isoform. The majority of Lola isoforms share an N-terminal BTB domain implicated in protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and in anchoring ubiquitin proteasome components, followed by an isoform-specific sequence containing a C-terminal zinc finger motif that is a putative DNA-binding region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the <italic>fru</italic> gene product FruM represents another, BTB-zinc finger protein group, which includes a set of male-specific proteins (i.e., FruAM, FruBM and FruEM: nomenclature according to Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) that function to masculinize certain neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> presumably via chromatin remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, FruM represses transcription from <italic>roundabout1</italic> (<italic>robo1</italic>), a negative regulator gene for neuritogenesis, thereby allowing male-specific neurite formation in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate that the male-biased Lola29M isoform forms a complex with FruBM. We further demonstrate that Lola29M is a precursor of the female-specific Lola29F isoform, an N-terminal truncation product of Lola29M that counteracts Lola29M action so as to inhibit male-specific neurite formation in females. Surprisingly, the male-specific transcriptional repressor FruBM protects Lola29M from its N-terminal truncation, which is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin1&#x000a0;(Cul1) and 26S proteasome. Thus, by making the masculinizing protein Lola29M resistant to degradation, the male-specific transcription factor FruBM prevents the production of the feminizing protein Lola29F. As a consequence, the male program for dimorphic circuit formation turns on and the female program turns off in the male brain.</p><p id="Par4">In humans, sexually biased incidence of certain neurological disorders has been well recognized, yet the origin of such sex differences remains largely an enigma. For instance, the male-to-female incidence ratios have been reported to vary from 1.37 to 3.7 in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, the etiology of which likely involves mitochondrial dysfunction due to defects in the proteasomal degradation system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our finding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that the neuronal sex-type specification involves proteasomal protein processing will shed light on the hitherto unknown mechanistic link among posttranslational protein modification, neural sex differentiation and complex neurobehavioral traits under normal and disordered conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>lola</italic> as a phenotypic modifier of <italic>fru</italic></title><p id="Par5">To obtain insights into the mechanism of <italic>fru</italic> actions on neural sex-type specification, we here screened for <italic>fru</italic> modifier genes. In this screen, we took advantage of a gain-of-function effect of <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> to disrupt the compound eye structure when overexpressed in the developing eye disc. Genome-wide searches for genes that can modify the <italic>fru</italic> eye phenotype were conducted by the Gene-Search (GS) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this system, a <italic>P</italic>-element vector carrying the GAL4-responsive DNA sequence <italic>UAS</italic> (the <italic>GS</italic>-element) was randomly inserted into the genome of a fly so that transcription units that happened to flank the <italic>GS</italic>-element insertion could be transcribed in the presence of an arbitrarily chosen <italic>GAL4</italic> transgene (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). This study used <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> to drive transcription via the <italic>GS</italic>-element as well as <italic>UAS-fruB</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> in the developing eye disc (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), yielding several enhancers of the <italic>fruB</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>-induced eye phenotype, which included <italic>lola</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c-e</xref>; for other <italic>fru</italic> modifiers see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). Conversely, a loss-of-function <italic>lola</italic> mutation dominantly suppressed the <italic>fru</italic>-induced distortion of the eye (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f,g</xref>). In subsequent analyses, we will focus on <italic>lola</italic> because: (1) it encodes proteins of the BTB-zinc finger superfamily to which Fru also belongs and (2) its functions in neurite guidance have been well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that reduced courtship toward a female in <italic>fru</italic> hypomorphic males was dominantly enhanced by two different <italic>lola</italic> null alleles (<italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>03089</italic></sup> and <italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>ORE76</italic></sup>), which are both homozygous lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and <italic>lola</italic> knockdown <italic>per se</italic> attenuated male courtship activities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

To obtain hints as to which of the Lola isoforms might have a role in the <italic>fru</italic>-dependent sexual differentiation, we examined possible effects of isoform-specific knockdown for isoforms 11, 17, 22, 26, 28 and 29, for which <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenic strains were publicly available, and found that isoforms 22 and 29 interfered with the sex-specific development of <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons (see below). Our extensive analyses of Lola expression with an antibody raised against an exon29-specific sequence (anti-Lola-exon 29; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) revealed two isoforms, Lola29M of ~110kD and Lola29F of ~80kD, the relative amounts of which were different between the sexes in wandering stage third instar larvae (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The isoform containing the sequence encoded by exon 29 was formally designated as type-Q<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We found that Lola29M is more abundant in males than females whereas Lola29F is detectable only in females (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Immunostaining of the wandering-stage larval CNS with the anti-Lola-exon 29 antibody revealed that Lola29M/F expression is confined to differentiating neurons, including those expressing FruM, but not detected in neuroblasts (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The Lola29M and Lola29F isoforms shared exon29, which was connected to the same 5&#x02019; exons, and transcribed from the same promoters. Because no sex difference was detected in the mRNA species with exon 29 by 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; RACE (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), the size difference between the Lola29F and Lola29M proteins was considered to result from posttranslational modification of a protein product. Intriguingly, <italic>fru</italic> mutant (<italic>fruM</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup>) males that are null for male-specific FruM proteins expressed the female-specific Lola29F isoform with a concomitant reduction in Lola29M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). In contrast, females sexually transformed into males by the&#x000a0;<italic>transformer</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>&#x000a0;(<italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>) mutation lost Lola29F with an elevated level of Lola29M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). These results imply that the posttranslational modification of the Lola protein is under the control of the sex-determination cascade downstream of <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Female-specific Lola29F is a truncation product of Lola29M</title><p id="Par7">To examine whether female-specific Lola29F is a truncation product of male-enriched Lola29M, we attempted to determine the structures of Lola29F and Lola29M and the mechanism whereby these two isoforms are produced in a sex-dependent manner. We presumed that Lola29F might be a proteolytic product of Lola29M. To test this idea, we overexpressed a <italic>lola29m</italic> gene decorated with an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal V5 tag in flies under the control of <italic>fru-GAL4</italic>, and analyzed the lysates from CNS cells by western blotting with antibodies against HA and V5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Remarkably, the anti-V5 antibody detected a shorter band similar to Lola29F (referred to as Lola29F-like hereafter) in addition to the full-length Lola29M, whereas the anti-HA antibody detected only the latter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Therefore, the difference between the two isoforms must reside in their N-termini. Overexpression of a series of N-terminal deletants of <italic>lola29m</italic> in <italic>fru-GAL4</italic>-positive cells resulted in the expression of mutant Lola29 proteins; deletion of the N-terminal 300 (&#x00394;1-300) residues yielded a single band of a size similar to that of Lola29F on western blots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). We infer that Lola29F is produced by the truncation of Lola29M somewhere between residues 250 and 300 of Lola29M, and later analyses by Edman degradation revealed that this is indeed the case (see below).</p><p id="Par8">Because <italic>lola</italic> plays an important role in neurite patterning, the effects of <italic>lola</italic> knockdown on courtship behavior (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) likely result from a disturbance in the formation of courtship circuits. It has been established that FruM plays a key role in the courtship circuit formation in the male CNS, and some of the <italic>fru</italic> mutant defects in mating behavior have been ascribed to impairments of sex-specific development of <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, to examine the possible role of Lola29F/M on the courtship circuit formation, we next examined <italic>fru</italic>-expressing mAL interneurons, which exhibit remarkable sex-differences (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2h</xref>), which have been shown to play a role in the processing of sex pheromone information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. One of the prominent sex differences found in mAL neurons is the absence (in females) or presence (in males) of the ipsilateral neurite. In a subsequent analysis, therefore, we focused on the male-specific ipsilateral neurite formation, where male-specific FruM directly represses transcription of <italic>robo1</italic> in males, thereby allowing mAL neurons to extend the male-specific neurite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Gain of the male-specific ipsilateral neurite (i.e., masculinization) in females or <italic>fruM</italic>-null mutant males can be assessed in neuroblast clones that contain up to 5 mAL neurons, because none of the mAL neurons in control females and control <italic>fruM</italic>-null males possesses this neurite. Loss of the male-specific neurite (i.e., feminization) in males, in contrast, is only detectable in single-cell clones, because any remaining ipsilateral neurite of unaffected cells hinder the neurite loss from affected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We therefore examine neuroblast clones for quantifying the masculinizing effect of genetic manipulations and single-cell clones for the feminizing effect.</p><p id="Par9">We first confirmed the immunoreactivity of mAL neurons to the anti-Lola-exon 29 antibody (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g-l). We then tested the effect of <italic>lola29</italic> knockdown in these cells. Notably, the expression of RNAi targeting <italic>lola-exon29</italic> markedly increased the formation of mAL neurons without the male-specific ipsilateral neurite in male mAL neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>m-q). It is noteworthy that the <italic>lola-exon29</italic> RNAi used here effectively inhibited Lola29M production in flies, which retained a high level of expression of other <italic>lola</italic> isoforms (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">To further clarify roles of Lola29M and Lola29F in the sex-type specification of neurites, we first wanted to define their molecular structures and the mechanism whereby two Lola29 forms are produced. To determine the exact site of truncation in producing Lola29F from Lola29M, we employed Edman degradation analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To obtain a large amount of Lola29F sufficient for amino acid sequencing, we overexpressed <italic>lola29m-6xV5</italic> under the control of <italic>fru-GAL4</italic> in female larvae, from which the CNSs were dissected to extract proteins for immunoprecipitating <italic>lola29m-6xV5</italic> products. The band representing Lola29F on the PVDF membrane visualized with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) was cut out and analyzed, allowing us to determine that the N-terminal five residues were SSTAA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This five-residue sequence was uniquely identified as a.a. 264&#x02013;268 in Lola29M.

An interesting possibility is that the male-specific protein FruM protects Lola29M against proteolysis. First, we tested the possibility that Lola29M forms a complex with FruM, because both proteins have a BTB domain, through which they may interact directly with each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>, an anti-Lola-exon29 antibody precipitated FruM together with Lola29M in flies. Moreover, a Lola29M-recognizing antibody failed to precipitate FruM, when the BTB domain of either FruM or Lola29M was deleted in an experiment with cotransfected S2 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that Lola29M and FruBM form a complex through each other&#x02019;s BTB domains.</p><p id="Par26">Second, we examined the effect of increased FruBM expression on the production of Lola29F in S2 cells transfected with <italic>lola29m</italic>. FruBM has been shown to be the major FruM isoform that contributes to neural sex differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We found that as the amount of FruBM increased the amount of Lola29F decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6j, k</xref>). Notably, FruBM lost its ability to inhibit the Lola29F production when its BTB domain but not its zinc finger domain was deleted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6l</xref>). These results demonstrate that FruBM binding to Lola29M, presumably as mediated by the BTB domains of two proteins, protects Lola29M against proteolysis, thereby preventing the production of Lola29F in males. Because female neurons lack FruM, Lola29M can be processed into Lola29F.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">In this study, we showed that Lola29M, and its truncation product, Lola29F, play important roles in the masculinization and feminization of one of the three types of sexual dimorphism exhibited by <italic>fru</italic>-expressing mAL neurons: Lola29M promotes the male-specific ipsilateral neurite formation in males, whereas Lola29F counteracts Lola29M and prevents the male-specific neurite from forming in females (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Our results support the hypothesis that males have only the full-length protein Lola29M, because male-specific FruBM binds to Lola29M and protects it from truncation, whereas females have, in addition to full-length Lola29M, N-terminally truncated Lola29F due to the absence of FruBM. As a consequence, the Lola29M action is inhibited by Lola29F in females. This would mean that Lola29M exerts its masculinizing action only when FruBM is present, representing an efficient and secure means to induce masculine characteristics in <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>A model of the interaction between Lola29M and Fru in shaping the sexual dimorphism of mAL neurons and fly sexual behavior. Female neurons (left-hand side) lack FruBM, and consequently Lola29F is produced in sufficient abundance to impede the masculinizing action of Lola29M, leading to the production of mAL neurons without the ipsilateral neurite. Male neurons (right-hand side) express FruBM, which forms a complex with Lola29M and represses proteolysis of Lola29M. This results in the accumulation of Lola29M, which induces the ipsilateral neurite in some mAL neurons via <italic>robo1</italic> repression</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_8146_Fig7_HTML" id="d29e1919"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">Our EMSA results demonstrated that Lola29M and FruBM share the same transcriptional target gene <italic>robo1</italic>, the transcription of which is repressed by each protein or by both proteins in synergy, according to our reporter assay data. The <italic>robo1</italic> gene encodes a transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, Robo1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which is a key effector to prevent the male-specific ipsilateral neurite from forming in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Lola29M induces the male-specific ipsilateral neurite by transcriptional repression of <italic>robo1</italic> (acting as a negative regulator of neuritogenesis) in males, whereas Lola29F appears to compete with Lola29M, allowing <italic>robo1</italic> to be transcribed, and as a result, Lola29F blocks the male-specific neurite formation in females. Our EMSA data identified two distinct DNA stretches, one harboring a Lola29M-binding site and the other a FruBM-binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> in the <italic>robo1</italic> promoter region, which were located side-by-side. On the other hand, our immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Lola29M and FruBM form a complex in vivo. It might be that Lola29M and FruBM each bound to their own binding sites interact in <italic>trans</italic>, leading the <italic>robo1</italic> promoter to a conformation unfavorable for transcriptional activation.</p><p id="Par29">We showed that the replacement of four lysine residues, K41, K44, K47 and K67, which are potential ubiquitination-targets, with arginine residues conferred resistance to N-terminal truncation on Lola29M, suggesting that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is involved in the Lola29M processing. We also showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul1 is required for the N-terminal truncation of Lola29M, and that the male-specific neurite formation is induced by <italic>Cul1</italic> knockdown in female mAL neurons. In natural killer T-cell thymocytes, the E3 ubiquitination enzyme Cul3 is recruited to a chromatin-modifying complex, where it then induces changes in the ubiquitination patterns of other components of the same complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This recruitment of Cul3 to the chromatin-modifying complex is mediated by BTB zinc finger proteins such as PLZF and BCL6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, it may be possible that Lola29M truncation is similarly mediated by a component in the protein complex to which Lola29M contributes. In this context, it would be worth mentioning that Cul1 and Cul3 play contrasting roles in the regulation of <italic>hedgehog</italic> (<italic>hh</italic>) signaling; in the absence of Hh, Cul1 is recruited to the Hh downstream zinc finger protein Cubitus interruptus (Ci155), which undergoes, as a consequence, partial degradation to yield the transcriptional repressor Ci75, whereas upon the Cul3 recruitment in the presence of Hh, Ci155 is completely degraded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It remains to be determined how Cul1 is recruited to Lola29M for its partial degradation in <italic>fru</italic>-positive neurons.</p><p id="Par30">A recent study documented neural activity-dependent activation of <italic>lola</italic> transcription, leading to the proposition that <italic>lola</italic> is an immediate early gene in insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The transient expression common to immediate early gene products is caused by the rapid degradation that follows their rapid induction. An intriguing possibility is that Lola proteins are vulnerable to rapid degradation through ubiquitination, unless their ubiquitination target sites are masked by a binding partner, such as FruBM, that interacts through the BTB domain. The known pleiotropic functions of Lola invite the supposition that other Lola isoforms expressed in a variety of cell types might form a complex with the different BTB proteins expressed there, accomplishing diversified roles unique to the individual cell type.</p><p id="Par31">The present work thus provides new insights into the molecular mechanism whereby a common transcription factor such as Lola can play distinct roles in different cells in a context-dependent manner. A growing body of evidence indicates that fate changes in a variety of cell lineages in both vertebrates and invertebrates are induced by rapid epigenetic remodeling by chromatin regulators, such as BTB-zinc finger transcription factors, some of which are known to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to the chromatin-modifying complex and thus alter its ubiquitination pattern. It is therefore plausible that the proteolytic removal of the N-terminal BTB domain from these transcription factors within the chromatin-modifying complex is a prevalent means to convert the epigenetic marks.</p><p id="Par32">Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that the association of BTB proteins with ubiquitin ligases plays multilayered regulatory roles in developmental decisions.
