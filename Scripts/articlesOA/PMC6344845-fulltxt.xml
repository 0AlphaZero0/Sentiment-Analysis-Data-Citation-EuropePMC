A comprehensive resource identifying positions within domains that tend to interact with nucleic acids, small molecules and other ligands would expand our knowledge of domain functionality as well as aid in detecting ligand-binding sites within structurally uncharacterized proteins. Here, we introduce an approach to identify per-domain-position interaction &#x02018;frequencies&#x02019; by aggregating protein co-complex structures by domain and ascertaining how often residues mapping to each domain position interact with ligands. We perform this domain-based analysis on &#x0223c;91000 co-complex structures, and infer positions involved in binding DNA, RNA, peptides, ions or small molecules across 4128 domains, which we refer to collectively as the InteracDome. Cross-validation testing reveals that ligand-binding positions for 2152 domains are highly consistent and can be used to identify residues facilitating interactions in &#x0223c;63&#x02013;69% of human genes. Our resource of domain-inferred ligand-binding sites should be a great aid in understanding disease etiology: whereas these sites are enriched in Mendelian-associated and cancer somatic mutations, they are depleted in polymorphisms observed across healthy populations.

Leveraging the fact that similar protein sequences or subsequences tend to share similar functions, computational approaches have been developed to mitigate this sequence-to-function discrepancy by rapidly detecting and modeling the sequence similarity between proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Such homology-driven analyses of large-scale protein sequence databases have revealed many thousands of recurrent, probabilistically modelable protein subsequences called &#x02018;domains&#x02019; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>). These sequence-derived domains correspond to evolutionarily and functionally related substructures of proteins and are found in various modular combinations within proteins from species across the tree of life (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Individual protein domains are associated with specific functionalities, among the most important of which are mediating the interactions proteins make with nucleic acids, other proteins and various other molecules in the cell. Indeed, protein&#x02013;DNA and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions have been found to occur via domain interfaces so frequently that factors associated with transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity are regularly classified according to their incorporation of particular nucleic acid-binding domains (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Moreover, a significant proportion of protein&#x02013;protein interactions in signaling pathways are mediated by modular binding domains (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Although simply knowing which domains mediate various ligand interactions has already accelerated our ability to annotate protein functions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), pinpointing the ligand-contacting positions <italic>within</italic> these domains would enable a more precise analysis of the many thousands of sequenced proteins across species that contain domain instances but lack further biological characterizations. Indeed, more comprehensive knowledge of protein interaction interfaces will have considerable implications for investigating the evolution and natural variation of interaction network connectivities (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), for determining the mechanistic impact of coding variants (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), for prioritizing germline and somatic perturbations to uncover disease etiology (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and for designing targeted therapeutic drugs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Identifying positions within domains that interact with ligands from sequence alone is nontrivial, as a minority of positions within a domain may be involved with ligand binding, and these positions may not be proximal with respect to the linear protein sequence (e.g.&#x000a0;of 264 positions in the tyrosine kinase domain, only 16 non-contiguous positions contact adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Further, while some ligand-binding positions are largely invariant across domain instances&#x02014;for example, the zinc-contacting positions in the Cys<sub>2</sub>-His<sub>2</sub> zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) domain are required for proper domain folding and thus are highly conserved&#x02014;other binding positions are not: amino acids within DNA-contacting positions in these same C2H2-ZF domains, for example, vary dramatically across domain instances to confer diverse binding specificities, and thus cannot be identified by conservation-based analyses (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, analyses of three-dimensional structures of proteins co-complexed with ligands are highly accurate in identifying positions comprising interaction interfaces. Previously, co-complex structures of a single or a few manually-selected domain instances have been used as models to distinguish domain positions involved in ligand binding from those that are not (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, binary classifications of domain binding positions determined from single structures are not always generalizable; indeed, analyses of structurally distinct instances of some domain families have revealed that the positions involved in binding peptides or other domains can vary (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As such, although various databases have associated domain families with corresponding structures and bound ligands, particularly in the context of domain&#x02013;domain interactions, they have largely avoided attempts to systematically determine, across multiple ligand types, the <italic>positions</italic> within these domains that mediate interactions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;23</xref>).</p><p>Here we introduce a robust, large-scale structural aggregation approach to systematically identify positions within domains that are likely to interact with ligands. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we analyze over 91000 protein&#x02013;ligand co-complex structures in the context of domains and develop a proximity-based scoring function that determines real-valued ligand-binding frequencies across individual positions in 4128 domains; we compute per-position binding frequencies separately for DNA, RNA, peptide, ion, metabolite and other small molecule ligands. Second, we show via cross-validation testing that the resultant per-domain-position binding frequencies can accurately reveal positions that bind ligands in held-out structures. Third, we utilize these <bold>Inter</bold>action&#x000a0;<bold>Dom</bold>ains, which we refer to collectively as the <bold>InteracDome</bold>, to infer interaction sites across &#x0223c;63% of human genes with high confidence, and up to &#x0223c;69% of human genes more broadly; this represents the most comprehensive resource of this type to date. Fourth, we uncover that these domain-inferred interaction sites across human proteins exhibit significant functional constraints: they are depleted for natural variants across healthy human populations, while they are enriched for Mendelian disease-associated and cancer somatic mutations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how our InteracDome resource can be leveraged to provide valuable, medically-relevant insights by detecting and interpreting the mechanistic effects of disease-associated coding mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1-1-1"><title>Overview</title><p>In this section, we describe our framework for systematically evaluating how different positions within domains are involved in mediating various ligand interactions. Briefly, we first obtain from BioLiP (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) a comprehensive collection of structures of proteins co-complexed with various ligands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Each of these structures contains the three-dimensional locations of all atoms within a protein chain and all atoms within a ligand; the protein chains are also represented linearly as sequences of amino acids. We then use probabilistic sequence matching to find instances of protein domains within these protein sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). For those domain families with instances across multiple protein sequences, we aggregate their instances into a multiple sequence alignment such that each column of the alignment corresponds to a &#x02018;core&#x02019; domain position (i.e.&#x000a0;a match state in the corresponding HMM profile (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)), and each row corresponds to a different domain instance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Next, we analyze the structure corresponding to each domain instance. For each amino acid residue in that instance corresponding to a core domain position, we calculate the minimum Euclidean distance between any of the atoms in that residue&#x02019;s side chain to any atoms in a ligand. This process leaves us with a distribution of minimum residue-to-ligand distances observed across structural instances for each domain position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Finally, we distill each of these per-domain-position distance distributions into a single &#x02018;binding frequency&#x02019; value that reflects that domain position&#x02019;s tendency to bind a particular ligand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). We describe each of these steps in more detail next.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

To identify domains that mediate protein interactions, we query all BioLiP protein sequences for instances of 16712 profile Hidden Markov models from the Pfam-A database (v31.0) using HMMER (v2.3.2 and v3.1b2) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We restrict to domain instances that pass Pfam&#x02019;s default gathering thresholds, have residues at the first and last domain positions, have the most likely residue at domain positions with information content &#x02265;4 (corresponding to a distribution where the most frequent amino acid appears with &#x0223c;95% probability), and contain at least one residue annotated by BioLiP to be involved in ligand binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>Differentiating and grouping ligand types</title><p>We classify BioLiP ligands into biologically relevant groups. Protein residues responsible for determining DNA- and RNA-binding specificity often contact nucleic acid bases, whereas residues that primarily contact the backbones of nucleic acid molecules may be more important for the stability and affinity of the binding complex (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). As BioLiP groups all DNA and RNA ligand molecules together, we reanalyze the original co-complex structures to characterize ligand atoms based on the presence (RNA) or absence (DNA) of the 2&#x02019;-hydroxyl in the ribose sugar; these ligands respectively occur in 2718 and 4377 co-complex structures. We further group these ligand atoms into RNA base, RNA backbone, DNA base or DNA backbone.</p><p>The 123 ligands from 38234 co-complex structures with &#x02018;ion&#x02019; in their full names are assigned to the ion group; the remaining 23829 ligands from 64918 co-complex structures are grouped as small molecules. BioLiP already excludes molecular artifacts from crystallization buffers, yet does not explicitly differentiate cognate (i.e.&#x000a0;naturally occurring <italic>in vivo</italic>) from non-cognate ligands. To highlight domain positions whose residues comprise metabolically relevant and/or potentially druggable binding pockets, we further categorize small molecules as follows. Any small molecule ligand with a Tanimoto coefficient &#x02265; 0.9 (Open Babel Package, v2.4.1) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) between its SMILES string (wwPDB&#x02019;s Chemical Component Dictionary, v3.30) and the SMILES strings of one of 102&#x000a0;639 endogenous human metabolites (Human Metabolome Database, v4.0) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and/or 9296 drugs (DrugBank, v5.1) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) is respectively classified as metabolite and/or druglike; these ligand types respectively occur in 35262 and 42947 co-complex structures. We note that previously a Tanimoto coefficient cutoff of 0.9 was shown to efficiently reduce molecular database search spaces while still enabling accurate molecule matching (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>); further, we find that cutoffs as low as 0.8 to classify small molecules as metabolite and/or druglike do not substantially alter the numbers of domains found to be in complex with these ligand types.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title>Computing proximity-based positional binding frequencies</title><p>We define the <italic>representable</italic> set of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions as those with at least one corresponding domain&#x02013;ligand co-complex structure in BioLiP. We require that these structures give coordinates for residue side-chain atoms&#x02014;as opposed to just backbone carbon atoms&#x02014;but do not otherwise consider structural resolution. For each domain in the representable set, we assess the ligand-binding frequencies of individual domain positions by aggregating protein&#x02013;ligand atom proximity information across their corresponding co-complex structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">E</xref>). For structures that have multiple chains or chain orientations with identical sequences, we select the single chain with the smallest Euclidean distance to the ligand of interest. For each instance of the domain in a BioLiP structure that contains at least one residue in contact with a particular ligand type, for each of its residues corresponding to a Pfam domain match state, we compute the minimum Euclidean distance between heavy (i.e.&#x000a0;non-hydrogen) side-chain atoms to any heavy ligand atom. We aggregate these distances by domain position across all BioLiP instances for the same domain&#x02013;ligand type pair, resulting in a per-domain-position distribution of minimum distances to the ligand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref>). We next determine what fraction of these distances are within 3.6&#x000c5; of the ligand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>); however, to proportionally minimize the contribution of structural instances with highly redundant sequences, we apply the Henikoff and Henikoff sequence weighting scheme (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) to the domain instances. Thus, intuitively, our per-domain-position binding frequency computes the (weighted) fraction of times a residue in that position is within 3.6&#x000c5; of the ligand type considered. Note that the distance of 3.6&#x000c5; will capture both hydrogen bonds (2.6&#x02013;3.3&#x000c5;) and van der Waals contacts (2.8&#x02013;4.1&#x000c5;), but will eliminate water-mediated interactions (as in (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)). We find that residue-to-ligand proximity cutoffs between 2.5 and 5.0&#x000c5; do not substantially alter which positions have the top 10&#x02013;15% of ligand-binding frequency values per domain.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Cross-validation testing of domain-to-ligand distance consistencies and positional binding frequencies</title><p>We refer to each domain&#x02013;ligand type pair with at least three distinct (i.e.&#x000a0;non-redundant) sequences across separate PDB entries as belonging to the <italic>representable-NR</italic> set. For each domain&#x02013;ligand pair in the representable-NR set, we evaluate both the consistency of its structural interface as well as the accuracy of our aggregation approach in identifying ligand-binding positions in cross-validation.</p><p>First, to evaluate consistencies of domain&#x02013;ligand structural interfaces, for each domain&#x02013;ligand pair in the representable-NR set, we first randomly split its structural instances into two folds. We next compute, across all instances within each fold, the average minimum residue-to-ligand distance at each domain position. Finally, we compute the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (PCC) between the two resulting domain-length vectors. We report the average PCC achieved across ten repetitions of this process as the consistency of the domain&#x02013;ligand structural interface.</p><p>Second, to test the power of our approach in identifying binding positions across previously unseen domain instances, for each domain&#x02013;ligand type pair in the representable-NR set, we randomly divide its structural instances into up to 10 folds. For each domain instance <italic>i</italic> in each hold-out fold in turn, we examine the structure to assign a binary vector where 1 and 0&#x000a0;respectively indicate domain positions whose residues are or are not in contact with the ligand (i.e.&#x000a0;as annotated by BioLiP). Binding frequencies are then calculated as before from instances in the remaining folds. For each position in each instance in the hold-out fold, we use the corresponding positional binding frequency, computed from the other folds, as its &#x02018;score.&#x02019; We then rank in descending order all positions within the hold-out fold by score, with higher ranking positions corresponding to the more confident predictions of binding. As we iteratively decrease the score threshold used to predict whether a position is binding, we compute precision and recall with respect to the known binding (true positive) and non-binding (true negative) positions inferred from the actual structures in the held-out set. This allows us to compute a precision-recall curve (PRC) for each domain&#x02013;ligand interaction. We refer to the set of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions that achieved a cross-validated precision of at least 0.5 at some threshold as the <italic>confident</italic> set. We also compute the area under under the PRC (AUPRC), and compare it to an average baseline AUPRC corresponding to the fraction of binding positions in the held-out set.</p><p>We note that instances of the same domain family have by definition clearly identifiable sequence similarity and thus can have highly similar amino acid sequences. Nevertheless, as an alternate cross-validation test, for each domain&#x02013;ligand type pair in the representable-NR set, we also try to divide all its instances within BioLiP into groups such that the amino acid sequence identity between instances in different groups is &#x0003c;90%. We repeat the steps above to determine domain&#x02013;ligand structural consistencies and cross-validated precisions and recalls by dividing these groups of BioLiP instances with sequence identity &#x02265;90%&#x02014;rather than individual instances&#x02014;into folds as before; these results are reported in the &#x02018;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref>&#x02019; section.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-6"><title>Human protein, natural variation and disease mutation datasets</title><p>Protein sequences, corresponding cDNA sequences and corresponding genomic coordinates for 104&#x000a0;295 known and predicted human protein isoforms encoded by 23043 genes were downloaded from Ensembl (build GRCh38.p10).

For each of these domain&#x02013;ligand pairs, the threshold to define ligand-binding positions is chosen as the value that resulted in cross-validated precision &#x02265;0.5, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-8"><title>Determining significance of overlap with inferred ligand-binding sites</title><p>Given a set of sites of interest in human proteins (e.g.&#x000a0;sites harboring common missense SNVs across populations) and a set of putative ligand-binding sites in human proteins, we determine whether the overlap between these two sets is significantly larger or smaller than what is expected by chance alone using the Poisson binomial distribution.

Of these, 2375 domain families have at least three non-redundant instances in complex with the same ligand type across distinct PDB structures; these domain&#x02013;ligand interactions comprise the representable-NR set. Within the representable set of domain interactions, 564 domain families are co-complexed with DNA, 490 are co-complexed with RNA, 830 are co-complexed with other peptides, 2557 are co-complexed with ions and 2847 are co-complexed with one or more small molecules.

Toward this end, we compiled a list of 54 DNA-binding domain families from the Thornton Lab review (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), 12 RNA-binding domain families from the review by (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and 78 human peptide-binding domain families listed on the Pawson Lab site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pawsonlab.mshri.on.ca">http://pawsonlab.mshri.on.ca</ext-link>). We find that our representable set of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions includes all the DNA-binding domain families, all the RNA-binding domain families and &#x0223c;85% of postulated protein-binding domain families, many of which have been particularly difficult to structurally characterize due to the low affinity and transience of protein&#x02013;protein interactions in signaling pathways (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Of these known ligand-binding domains, 42 (78%) DNA-binding domains, 9 (75%) RNA-binding domains and 47 (60%) peptide-binding domains are found in the representable-NR set; these numbers are 42 (78%), 8 (67%) and 43 (55%), respectively, for known ligand-binding domains found in the confident set.</p><p>Next, we turn our attention to how well our per-domain-position binding frequencies identify manually curated ligand-binding domain positions. In particular, domain positions involved in ligand binding have previously been established for a few well-studied domains using one or a few structural co-complexes. Intuitively, our method automates this approach at a much larger scale; thus, we expect that domain positions assigned high binding frequencies by our method will largely be in agreement with previous knowledge of domain binding. We highlight below a few well-studied nucleic acid-, peptide- and metabolite-binding domains to show that indeed, when we compare InteracDome binding frequencies with literature-curated knowledge of domain&#x02013;ligand binding, domain positions with high binding frequency values recapitulate known interaction positions.</p><p>We first consider three nucleic acid binding domains. The C2H2-ZF domain is known to specify its DNA targets via four DNA-base contacting positions (-1, 2, 3 and 6 in the &#x003b1;-helix contacting DNA) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>); these four positions have the highest DNA base-binding frequencies for this domain in the InteracDome. Additionally, there are two highly conserved cysteines and histidines that coordinate the zinc ion&#x02014;required for proper domain folding&#x02014;and these four positions have our highest ion-binding frequencies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). In the DNA-binding homeodomain, our highest DNA base-binding frequencies correspond to positions 45&#x02013;46, 49&#x02013;50 and 53&#x02013;54 in the DNA recognition helix, followed by positions 1&#x02013;4 in the N-terminal arm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>); these are known specificity-determining positions in the domain (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In the RNA-binding pumilio domain, the highest RNA base-binding frequencies are found in positions 14, 16, 17 and 20 of the repeating &#x003b1;-helix section (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1c</xref>).

In the WW domain, our highest peptide-binding frequencies are found at positions 17, 19, 21, 24, 26 and 28&#x02014;all corresponding to known binding residues. The next highest peptide-binding frequencies identify positions 8, 10 and 11&#x02014;all known to confer binding specificity differences between type I and IV domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1d</xref>) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Sites with high binding frequencies for the SH3 domain are also relevant for peptide binding. In particular, positions with the highest binding frequency values are 4, 6, 32 and 47&#x02014;the four most conserved peptide-binding sites&#x02014;and positions 9&#x02013;13, 27&#x02013;30, 34 and 45&#x02014;all known to be important for distinct peptide-binding specificities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1e</xref>) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our approach also recapitulates ATP-binding positions in the kinase domain. Our high small molecule binding frequencies include several residues from subdomains I&#x02013;VII that are responsible for interacting with and anchoring ATP&#x02019;s adenine ring (i.e.&#x000a0;positions 7, 15, 28, 77&#x02013;80, 84), &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphates (i.e.&#x000a0;positions 11&#x02013;13, 30, 128, 141), and ribose hydroxyl group (i.e.&#x000a0;position 127) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We also highly rank an additional six sites within three amino acids of a known binding position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Domain-to-ligand proximities are consistent across instances</title><p>We next show, in a systematic analysis, that structural interfaces between domains and their ligands in the representable-NR set tend to be conserved. Briefly, we compare the residue-to-ligand distances across different structural instances of a domain&#x02013;ligand interaction type to each other (see &#x02018;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC2">Materials and Methods</xref>&#x02019; section). We find that analogous positions across domain instances indeed tend to have similar distances to ligands: the median PCC of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions is 0.98 and the PCC &#x02265; 0.8 for 91% of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Thus, domains tend to have highly consistent structural interaction interfaces with the same ligand type across instances.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Domain-to-ligand distance consistencies</bold>. Structural instances across BioLiP for each domain&#x02013;ligand type in the representable-NR set are randomly split into two folds. Shown are PCCs of the average residue-to-ligand distances across each domain position between the two folds, averaged across 10 repetitions. Relative domain-to-ligand distances across domain positions tend to be highly consistent between structural instances of the same domain&#x02013;ligand pair. Total number of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions included in each boxplot are listed above the corresponding distributions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gky1224fig3"/></fig><p>As we have just shown, domains generally tend to interact with their ligands in a relatively consistent fashion. However, some interaction domains are also known to have multiple binding modes, where different combinations of domain positions are in contact with the ligand (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>); these cases cannot be detected by examining structural domain instances in isolation, but may be revealed using our aggregation approach. To get a better idea of how much domain positions vary with respect to their roles in ligand binding, for each domain&#x02013;ligand type pair in the representable-NR set, we use empirical bootstrapping of structural instances with 1000 repetitions to obtain standard errors of all binding frequencies. Smaller standard errors indicate a domain position&#x02019;s consistent role in binding, whereas larger bootstrapped standard errors indicate that the measured binding frequency of that position is highly dependent upon the specific groups of structures being considered, and thus the position plays a more variable role in ligand binding. Importantly, standard errors tend to be low for the full range of ligand-binding frequencies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). Moreover, as expected, positions with more extreme binding frequency values (i.e.&#x000a0;&#x02265;0.95 or &#x02264;0.05) tend to have lower standard errors. Conversely, positions with intermediate binding frequencies also exhibit more variation in their estimates in bootstrapped samples. We also show that with more sequentially-distinct structural examples of domain&#x02013;ligand complexes, the standard errors of computed binding frequencies decrease overall (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>). This latter finding indicates that aggregating information across structural domain instances allows us to infer which positions within domains bind particular ligands more confidently than we could if we were limited to only one or a few structural examples. We note that whereas positions with positive binding frequencies are, by definition, known to interact with ligands in some contexts, positions with 0-value binding frequencies may also sometimes be involved in binding, but are not yet represented in the set of solved structures. Thus, overall, we expect that our aggregation approach will continue to improve as more structures of previously unobserved domain binding modes are experimentally determined.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>

To measure this, we employ cross-validation to compute PR curves for each domain&#x02013;ligand pair in the representable-NR set, and compare the AUPRCs to corresponding baseline AUPRCs (see &#x02018;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC2">Materials and Methods</xref>&#x02019; section). We find that the average (across folds) actual AUPRCs are typically substantially higher than their corresponding baseline AUPRCs, particularly for domain&#x02013;ion interactions which tend to involve far fewer domain binding positions and thus have lower baseline AUPRCs (median fold improvement of actual over baseline AUPRCs = 19.9, fold improvement &#x02265; 5 for 94.2% of domain&#x02013;ligand interactions, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Corresponding deleteriousness scores for each of these mutations were retrieved, where available, from the Database for Nonsynonymous SNPs&#x02019; Functional Predictions (v3.5) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>); many mutations analyzed did not have corresponding deleteriousness scores for one or more predictors.

Somatically mutated sites in particular appear to overlap with putative DNA-binding sites across proteins significantly more than expected, in accordance with what we know about impaired DNA repair functionality and perturbed regulatory processes in cancer (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Importantly, we continue to observe the same overall trends for sites exhibiting naturally occurring variation, Mendelian disease mutations, and somatic mutations when we consider alternate precision-based definitions of putative ligand-binding sites from the representable-NR set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Overall, given that natural missense variants across healthy populations are depleted in putative binding sites, and Mendelian disease-associated missense mutations as well as somatic missense mutations across cancer tumors are enriched in them, computational approaches that leverage our InteracDome resource to identify perturbed interaction sites are likely to be highly relevant for identifying disease genes and informing disease mechanisms.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have introduced here a fully automated approach for aggregating protein co-complex structural data in the context of domains to reveal how positions within these domains are generally involved in mediating interactions with DNA, RNA, ions, peptides, metabolites and other small molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This collection of 4128 interaction domains, called the InteracDome, can be applied to pinpoint putative interaction sites in various proteins across species; here we show how a subset of 2152 domains with confident ligand interactions can be used to infer functionally relevant interaction sites across the greatest proportion of human genes to date (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><p>Previously, interaction site information has been transferred from structurally modeled proteins to uncharacterized proteins with similar sequences or subsequences using various homology-based approaches (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Sequence motifs have also been semi-manually annotated with highly conserved metal ion binding or catalytic site information for use in identifying functional sites in new proteins, although such approaches are limited due to their rigid sequence match requirements (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Indeed, the ability of traditional homology-based approaches to infer binding information across larger, more diverse sets of protein sequences using existing structural templates is restricted in general because even as the number of resolved protein structures is increasing, the diversity of their sequences is not. Here, we develop a structurally-aware, domain-based approach to calculate real-valued binding frequencies across individual domain positions. These probabilistically-modeled domain profiles are better able to capture conserved residues required for proper domain folding and thus can be used to accurately transfer binding site knowledge across a far more diverse set of proteins.</p><p>Determining the binding positions within these domains represents a challenging task due to biases inherent in structural data: structures often harbor confounding experimental artifacts, are dominated by non-cognate drug interactions, and can have highly redundant sequences to each other (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We show that by addressing each of these issues in turn, our systematic approach models binding positions across thousands of domains&#x02014;including nearly all known DNA-, RNA- and peptide-binding domains&#x02014;that are highly indicative of ligand-binding positions in well characterized domains as well as in structural instances that were held out in cross-validation testing (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Moreover, we find that aggregating domain co-complex structures to develop a general understanding of how a domain participates in interactions is superior to using only one or a few structures for this task (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>Some domains can bind different types of ligands, though one of these may be rare or nonstandard; for instance, the C2H2-ZF and HTH domains predominantly bind DNA but sometimes bind RNA or peptides. Other domains may bind the same ligand type via multiple, diverse binding modes; for example, though the PAZ domain primarily binds RNA, the positions within the domain mediating RNA interactions vary across structural instances. We mitigate these two concerns in our aggregation approach by conservatively restricting domain&#x02013;ligand interactions to those with substantial structural representation that bind consistently across instances as demonstrated via cross-validation testing (i.e.&#x000a0;&#x02018;confident&#x02019; domain&#x02013;ligand interactions).</p><p>Substantial previous work has focused on detecting and characterizing the domain&#x02013;domain interactions that mediate a number of protein&#x02013;protein interactions across cellular interaction networks (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55&#x02013;58</xref>). We make the distinction that in our work, we focus not on detecting the particular domain-mediated interfaces between specific protein partners, but rather on understanding which positions within protein domains mediate a variety of interactions in general with nucleic acids, peptides, metabolites, and a wide range of small molecules. Though we do not consider proteins in complex with other whole proteins here, our framework can be naturally extended to characterize domain&#x02013;domain interactions in more depth.</p><p>Overall, we believe that our structural aggregation framework and resultant InteracDome resource lay the groundwork for many future domain-centric analyses and thus will be of broad use for the community. Not only can knowledge of domain binding positions be used to further group, subtype, subdivide or functionally annotate domain families themselves, but the putative interaction sites inferred across proteins using the InteracDome should be relevant in understanding disease etiology. Indeed, we find that these sites are globally conserved across healthy human individuals yet preferentially perturbed in tumor samples and disease populations. As such, we anticipate that future approaches that utilize InteracDome to detect interaction-altering protein coding variants will be a great aid in both prioritizing disease-associated mutations as well as reasoning about their molecular effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gky1224_supplemental_files.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank the members of the Singh lab for their insight and comments.
