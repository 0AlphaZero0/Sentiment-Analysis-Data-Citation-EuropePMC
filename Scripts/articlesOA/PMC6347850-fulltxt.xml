Clear systemic metabolic markers of infections such as glycerol and betaine were identified. Weight loss in untreated animals was in part explained by the observation of a modification of systemic host energy metabolism characterized by the utilization of glycerol as a glucose precursor. However, antibiotic treatment triggered an increased VLDL/HDL ratio in plasma that may contribute to reducing weight loss observed in treated birds. All metabolic responses co-occurred with significant shift of the microbiota upon infection or antibiotic treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">This study indicates that infection and antibiotic treatment trigger dysbiosis that may impact host systemic energy metabolism and cause phenotypic and health modifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12917-018-1761-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microbiota</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic</kwd><kwd>Energy</kwd><kwd>Dysbiosis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">Gut microbiota (GM) composition is known to strongly influence host health by a wide range of mechanisms ranging from control of immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], metabolic homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and drug metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Even if generally stable within a species, the GM composition is strongly impacted by environmental exposure (nutrition, xenobiotics and infection) and any modification of this ecosystem can affect host health by altering the symbiotic relationship existing between the host and its gut microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For instance, presence of an opportunistic pathogen in the digestive tract can be asymptomatic but also induce severe health damage. Furthermore, infection is generally associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the digestive track [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but the impact of such modification on the host metabolism and development of symptom such as weight loss is still poorly understood. Improvement of symptoms is generally observed post antibiotic treatment due to reduction in the number of pathogenic bacteria and the decline of the sequelae of their infection. However, antibiotic use is also associated with a reduction of GM diversity that has been linked to further host metabolic weakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Avian intestinal Spirochaetosis (AIS) is caused by the colonization of bird&#x02019;s lower digestive tract by the pathogen <italic>Brachyspira pilosicoli</italic> (phylum Spirochaetes; class Spirochaetes; order Spirochaetales; family Bracyspiraceae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The bacterium attaches to the cell wall and may trigger diarrhea associated with decreased growth rate and egg production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most common treatment used to tackle infection is Tiamulin&#x02122;, an antibiotic of the pleuromutilin family that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S region of the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Only a few studies have evaluated its efficiency in chickens despite its intensive use to treat avian flocks in industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To date this disease and its treatment have been little studied and remain poorly understood. Indeed, the cause for symptoms such as weight loss and decreased egg production are still unclear. In a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the efficiency of three doses of Tiamulin&#x02122; to treat laying hens orally challenged with <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> B2904 was evaluated and revealed that infection was associated with decreased growth rate and that birds treated with Tiamulin&#x02122; recovered from infection regardless of the dose used while weight maintenance was only observed in response to the two highest doses. Furthermore, Tiamulin&#x02122; reduced significantly other infection-associated symptoms as well as systemic spread of <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic>. Nevertheless, three weeks after antibiotic treatment ended, colonization of the digestive track by the pathogen was still observed. Thus, we concluded that this study represented an interesting infection model to understand host systemic metabolic and gut microbiota response to colonization of the digestive tract by a pathogen. In addition, the experimental design allows a longitudinal exploration of the effects of antibiotic treatment on a superorganism (i.e. the host and its gut microbiota). In this paper, we present results obtained following the analysis of biopsy and biofluid samples collected during the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To evaluate host systemic metabolic response to infection and antibiotic treatment we used <sup>1</sup>H-NMR-based metabolomics that allows a non-targeted evaluation of metabolic fluctuations occurring in biological systems. As the gut microbiota are inextricably linked to host&#x02019;s metabolic responses, its composition in response to infection and treatment was monitored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S NGS). Both analyses provided new insights into the impact of infection and antibiotic treatment on host health, explaining physiological response to both bacterial and chemical exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Infection and antibiotic treatment impact growth and egg production</title><p id="Par12">Impact of infection and egg production was monitored along the study in all groups (A, control; B infected only; C-E, infected and treated with Tiamulin&#x02122; from lowest to highest dose).

The two highest Tiamulin&#x02122; doses (group D and E) were able to maintain chicken&#x02019;s growth since birds from these two groups presented higher weights than those in the control group by the end of the study and that this was significantly higher to the infected group (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). However, animals treated with the lowest dose (Group C), displayed an average weight at the end of the study that was similar to the one of the infected group (B) and significantly different to the other three (A, D and E). This suggested that only higher doses of antibiotics were associated with maintain growth rate during the infection.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental plan (<bold>a</bold>) and birds body weight (<bold>b</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12917_2018_1761_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Infection induces systemic metabolic response of the host</title><p id="Par13">Systemic metabolic response to infection by <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> was observed directly after the end of the challenge period (day 6).

Livers of infected birds were richer in glycerol, lactate, choline, succinate and acetate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In the spleen, infection resulted in decreased <italic>O</italic>-phosphocholine, glutamine and AMP and increased glycerol, uracil, cytidine and leucine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In kidney, infection induced an increase in glycerol, uracil and xanthine contents, concomitant with a decrease in inosine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Increased betaine and glycerol were also associated with infection in plasma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d).

Two weeks after the end of the infection period (PM2), kidney, liver and spleen of infected but not treated birds had recovered their metabolic homeostasis (there were no more detectable metabolic differences between the control and any other group), which indicates that no metabolic variations were observed in response to infection.

We hypothesized that modifications of the gut microbiota by infection would result in modulations of host metabolic homeostasis that was corrected in this study using Tiamulin&#x02122; treatment. Materials used for this paper were sampled from a study that showed significantly decreased growth rates amongst other clinical sequelae of egg laying chickens in response to <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The infection resulted in an increase in Proteobacteria of which many are opportunistic pathogens associated with increased risk of diarrhea. Interestingly, Proteobacteria enrichment has been associated with metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Increase in Proteobacteria has previously been observed in response to Penicillin in mice that was linked to increased body weight, percentage fat mass and diabetes incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In the present study, infection and bacterial dysbiosis were concurrent with profound host systemic metabolic changes. The range of tissues affected by infection (liver, spleen, kidney and plasma) indicates a systemic metabolic response of the organism to <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> colonization and dysbiosis. Interestingly increased glycerol levels were noticeable in all aforementioned compartments. Systemic glycerol increase is a marker of lipolysis in adipose tissues where triglycerides are lysed into free fatty acids and glycerol by lipase enzymes. Glycerol is then released in the general circulation to be used as a glucose precursor in the liver and/or the kidney. This mechanism is generally activated by prolonged low plasma glucose levels. In addition, GI infection can impair glucose absorption due to gut barrier disruption and it thus possible that this phenomenon was also triggered by reduced intestinal glucose uptake. <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> is known to strongly disrupt the intestinal wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which was further supported by the observation of higher glucose levels in feces of infected birds. The increased polysaccharides in feces may also be associated with the ability of <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> to degrade mucin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the concomitant increase in butyrate and acetate observed during the infection attests higher carbohydrate fermentation and therefore a modification of the GM metabolic activity. Plasma glucose concentration is highly controlled and regulated since its level needs to be maintained to sustain essential functions such as brain and muscular activity. To maintain glucose levels gluconeogenesis from glycerol is activated during fasting, which requires fat storage to release non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol in plasma. This reduction of fat mass is likely to be related to the decreased growth rate observed in chickens colonized by <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the drop in plasma glucose level observed at PM2 following recovery of glycerol levels, suggests that this alternative metabolic pathway cannot sustain the energy demand for a long time.</p><p id="Par28">Complete recovery of host metabolic homeostasis in response to infection was reached at the end of the study (PM3). This coincided with a net decrease in percentage of infected birds in all groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and a stabilization of the caecal microbiota. Hence, symptoms and noticeable metabolic responses of the host to infection occurred only when microbiota dysbiosis was observed. Such an observation suggests that both presence of the pathogen and modification of gut microbial community are necessary to trigger host metabolic responses. The idea that the GM might act as a buffer regulating host metabolic response to infection by a pathogen has been partially explored by Khosravi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], who showed that <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection triggered a stronger host metabolic response (modification of insulin, ghrelin and leptin levels) in germ free mice than in conventional animals and that infection-induced decreased growth rate was only observed in absence of GM. This tolerance to pathogen has been associated with the training of the immune system. Thus, an infection can be considered as a response to an ecosystem variation rather than to colonization by a single pathogen.</p><p id="Par29">In this set of results, Tiamulin&#x02122; was able to reduce infection-induced metabolic response, the betaine increase and glucose drop in plasma. Although a dose response was observed on the level of infection measured by positive swabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], this was not true for the plasma betaine levels. It is likely that increased betaine levels in response to infection was related to the central osmoprotectant role of this molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Betaine has been used previously as food supplement for chickens due to its ability to protect the gut barrier against pathogens such as <italic>Coccidia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>B. pilosicoli</italic> cell invasion induces swelling and disturbance of the osmotic balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Increased quantities of betaine (generally coming from kidneys) may therefore be transported from other tissues towards the gut barrier via general circulation explaining its increased level in plasma.</p><p id="Par30">We observed that normal &#x02018;metabolic aging&#x02019; (decreased HDL/VLD and glucose plasma levels) occurring at puberty was accelerated by Tiamulin&#x02122; treatment. Interestingly, decreased of the HDL/VLDL ratio and glucose levels in the general circulation have been associated with increased levels of steroid hormones and more specifically progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A, an important enzyme family present in the liver involved in drug detoxification) are involved in steroid hormone metabolism (progesterone, estrogen and testosterone). In addition, it was shown in several studies that a decrease in CYP3A activity generally resulted in increased plasma steroid hormone concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Antibiotics are active molecules that can interact directly with the host if able to cross the gut barrier. It has been reported that Tiamulin&#x02122; interacts with CYP3A, forming a complex that results in the inactivation of the cytochrome in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that the observed pre-puberty metabolic shift resulted from the interaction of Tiamulin&#x02122; with progesterone metabolism. This was further supported by the fact that egg laying onset, which highly depends on steroids metabolism maturation, occurred earlier in the two groups receiving the highest doses of Tiamulin&#x02122; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Altogether, this supports the potential interaction of Tiamulin&#x02122; with steroid metabolism.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, the lipoprotein shift may also be caused by the gut microbiota modifications due to antibiotic treatment. The host-GM metabolic interplay has been widely investigated. Indeed, many studies have reported that obesity and energy metabolism homeostasis are strongly associated with gut microbiota composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the use of antibiotics before puberty in humans and mice can be associated with increased risk of metabolic disorders due to modulations of the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, a low Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio has been reported to be related to a lean phenotype and lower risk of developing disorders characterized by modification of cholesterol metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, this is contrary to our observations which suggests that the VLDL/HDL modification detected might be driven by the Tiamulin&#x02122; itself rather than by microbiota modifications: whether this is a generalizable phenomenon for some or all classes of antibiotic is clearly very worthy of future study. Also we need be mindful that other bacterial changes may be responsible for modification of cholesterol metabolism: indeed some lactic acid bacteria are known to be able to metabolize cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and their use as feed supplement in broiler chickens resulted in decreased plasma cholesterol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Hence, further experimentation would be needed to tease these aspects apart.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">This work demonstrates that gut microbiota composition can be associated with perturbations of host systemic metabolism that lead towards phenotypical changes. We observed that infection was associated with dysbiosis, decreased nutrient absorption and host energy metabolic disorder that resulted in significantly reduced growth rate. Two systemic biomarkers of infection were identified as glycerol and betaine. Increased systemic glycerol clearly illustrated host metabolic adaptation to intestinal infection directed towards providing sufficient energy supplies for survival. However, impaired weight gain was still observed presumably, as glycerol was likely to be supplied from adipose tissue. In addition, symptoms due to colonization by the pathogen were only observed when associated with gut microbial dysbiosis. This finding strongly supports the potential protective role of the gut microbiota against opportunistic pathogens. This indicates that further studies should be undertaken to understand the ecological context in which a pathogenic bacterium might become harmful for its host. In this study, the antibiotic treatment reduced infection and associated symptoms while modifying cholesterol metabolism. From our results, and previously published work we hypothesized that host metabolic response to antibiotic treatment resulted from a co-occurring modification of the gut microbiota composition and steroids metabolism. These findings suggest that impact of antibiotic consumption on host energy metabolism should be studied as a response of a direct interaction and through mediation of the gut microbiota. Finally, antibiotic triggered a decrease in &#x003b1;-diversity followed by dysbiosis that might lead to higher vulnerability to colonization by pathogen and favor relapse. Therefore, antibiotic treatment coupled to food supplements such as pre/pro/symbiotic should be considered in order to recover a &#x02018;healthier&#x02019; gut microbiota post intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animal study and experimental design</title><p id="Par33">Briefly, 150 16&#x02013;17&#x02009;weeks old NovoGen Brown commercial layer hens sourced from a commercial supplier (Tom Barron Ltd., UK) were housed at the APHA (Addlestone, Surrey, UK) according to Home Office guidelines (Home office license -PPL 70/7249-) and all procedures were performed in compliance with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act, 1986.
