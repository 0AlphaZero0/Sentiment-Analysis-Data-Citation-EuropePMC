PMC2585009	P55957	In contrast to lymphocytes, macrophages exposed to HIV-1 are relatively resistant to apoptosis [39], [40], which led us to expect that macrophages would display an anti-apoptotic transcriptome and proteome response to virus. 	Surprisingly, within 2 days, when the greatest response to virus occurred, multiple pro-apoptotic factors, including BID (Swiss-Prot ID: P55957), PAK2 (Entrez Gene ID: 5062), and ASK1 (Entrez Gene ID: 4217), displayed increased expression, while anti-apoptotic factors, such as BCL2 (Entrez Gene ID: 596), were decreased in expression (Fig. 3B). 	Although relative levels of NF-κB and NEMO (Entrez Gene ID: 8517) increased in response to virus, both are molecular hubs that serve as signaling partners in other pathways, including MAPK and TLRs. Over the course of viral replication, relative expression of pro-apoptotic genes declined and anti-apoptotic genes increased (Fig. 3C). 
PMC2585009	Q92934	Over the course of viral replication, relative expression of pro-apoptotic genes declined and anti-apoptotic genes increased (Fig. 3C). 	The transcriptome response was extended by analysis of the intracellular proteome compartment that also displayed increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAD (Swiss-Prot ID: Q92934), APAF-1 (Swiss-Prot ID: O14727), and Caspase-7 (Swiss-Prot ID: P55210), within 2 days of viral treatment, while anti-apoptotic proteins, such as CDC42GAP (Swiss-Prot ID: Q07960), showed lower expression levels on day 2 compared to mock (Fig. 3D). 	Results indicate the dynamic temporal response by macrophages to HIV-1. HIV-1 treatment affects expression patterns of members of the apoptotic pathway in primary macrophages.

PMC2585009	P45983	Virus alters macrophage molecular program independent of cell proliferation 	Calcium, apoptosis, and MAPK pathways interface through molecular hubs, such as NF-κB, NEMO, PRKCG, JNK (Swiss-Prot ID: P45983), and YWHAE (Swiss-Prot ID: P62258), with multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and TLR. 	Yet, in contrast to calcium, apoptosis, and MAPK pathways, neither cell proliferation nor TLR pathways was identified as significantly altered by Pathway-Express analysis. Although HIV-1 is capable of crossing the nuclear envelope of terminally differentiated cells without a requirement for proliferation [44], [45], some groups report a portion of macrophages proliferating in vitro and have an enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [46], [47].

In contrast, other groups find that HIV-1 treatment increases the expression of CDK inhibitors, specifically CDKN1A (also known as p21Cip1/WAF1, Swiss-Prot ID: P38936), and other targets in the cell cycle important for efficient viral replication [13], [48]. 	To determine if HIV-1 interactions with macrophages are accompanied by macrophage proliferation in our studies, two approaches were used. HIV-1- or mock-treated macrophages labeled with propidium iodide showed no differences in DNA content over 10 days (data not shown).

PMC2585009	P01375	TLR signaling is transmitted through a MyD88-dependent and/or, depending on the TLR, a MyD88-independent pathway (Fig. 7). 	Both pathways result in production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as type I interferons and TNF (Swiss-Prot ID: P01375) [50]. 	To determine if proximal signaling molecules respond to virus, we evaluated phosphorylation of TLR signaling members, IRAK-1 (specific for the MyD88-dependent pathway, Swiss-Prot ID: P51617) and IRF-3 (member of both pathways). Treatment of macrophages with TLR agonists LPS (primarily TLR4 agonist) or Poly(I:C) (primarily TLR3 agonist) produced phosphorylated forms of IRAK-1 within 30 minutes or IRF-3 within one hour (Fig. 8A–F).

Phophorylated forms of IRAK-1 or IRF-3 appeared transiently and decreased by 3 hours. 
PMC2585009	P20591	The relatively limited proportion of macrophages infected by HIV-1 within the first 24 hours could limit detection by western blot of phosphorylated/activated IRAK-1 or IRF3. 	To address this issue, levels of Mx1 protein (Swiss-Prot ID: P20591) were measured. 	Mx1 (Swiss-Prot ID: P20591), an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene, is a relatively stable, sensitive marker for low levels of interferon and innate immune activation [51]. Although treatment of macrophages through multiple TLRs 4, 3, or 8 for 24 hours stimulated increased intracellular levels of the Mx1 protein, treatment by HIV-1 induced no expression of Mx1 protein (Fig. 9).

PMC2585009	P01584	Macrophages were treated for 24 hours with any one of a variety of TLR ligands, including LPS, Poly(I:C), and CL097 (TLR7/8 agonist), as well as CL075 (TLR8 agonist) or R837 (TLR7 agonist) to distinguish differences that might result from selective activation through individual TLRs. 	Overall, each agonist stimulated production of TNF, IL-1β (Swiss-Prot ID: P01584), and IL-6 (Swiss Prot ID: P05231) (Fig. 11A–C, gray bars). 	In contrast, no proinflammatory cytokines were detected with HIV-1 treatment alone. Yet, when HIV-1 infected macrophage cultures were treated with TLR agonists, increased levels of cytokines were produced (Fig. 11A–C, black bars).

PMC2643051	535000	LHON mutations 	LHON (OMIM 535000) was first described as a distinctive clinical entity in 1871 by the German ophthalmologist Theodore Leber (1840–1917).3 He reported a characteristic pattern of visual loss among members of four families and his observations were subsequently confirmed in pedigrees from different populations.4–6 These early studies highlighted several of the salient features of LHON including the maternal transmission of the disease, the predilection of males to lose vision, and the almost exclusive involvement of the optic nerve. 	The non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance was only fully explained in 1988 when LHON became the first human disease proven to be caused by a point mutation (m.11778G>A) within the mitochondrial genome.7 Over 95% of LHON pedigrees are now known to harbour one of three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations: m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C, which all involve genes encoding complex I subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.8 In a meta-analysis of 159 pedigrees from Northern Europe and Australia, m.11778G>A was the most prevalent mutation but there is considerable variation in the relative frequency of these three primary LHON mutations worldwide (table 1). The predominance of m.11778G>A is even more pronounced in the Far East where it accounts for ∼90% of all cases,9 10 and although m.14484T>C is relatively rare, it is the most common mutation found among French Canadians (87%) as a result of a founder event.11 12 Primary mutations have not been identified in a small minority of clinically diagnosed LHON patients, the most likely explanation being that rare pathogenic mtDNA variants are segregating in these families.13 Disease causing mutations have been identified in a proportion of these cases, while other putative LHON mutations require further confirmation as they have only been found in singletons or a single family (table 1). 
PMC2643051	165500	Clinical features 	The clinical features of DOA (OMIM 165500) were first described in one British family by Batten in 1896119 120; the phenotype was further clarified by Kjer in his extensive study of Dutch families in the 1950s,119 120 distinguishing it from LHON with which the disease was often confused. 	The prevalence of DOA is not well established and robust estimates based on molecular confirmation are not available, although a historical figure of 1 in 50 000 among Caucasians is often quoted in the literature.121 It is thought to be the most common inherited optic neuropathy in the Netherlands, with a population frequency of 1 in 12 000, and this much higher prevalence has been linked to a mutational founder event.122 The onset of symptoms in DOA is relatively insidious.

PMC2910055	GM06990	Here we used 3C as a discovery tool for ab initio identification of distant regulatory elements that interact specifically with the active CFTR promoter. 	We performed 3C with Caco2 cells, which express high levels of CFTR, and with GM06990 lymphoblastoid cells, which express very low levels of CFTR (Supplementary Figure S1) to identify genomic elements that physically associate with the CFTR promoter. 	We used a PCR primer located in the EcoRI fragment that contains the CFTR TSS and paired it with primers in restriction fragments throughout a 460-kb region surrounding the promoter (primer sequences available in Supplementary Table S1). This experimental setup will detect ligation (and thus long-range interaction) of the promoter fragment with any of the other restriction fragments. 
PMC2910055	GM06990	The results are shown in Figure 1A (3C data available in Supplementary Table S2). 	In GM06990 cells, we observe that the promoter fragment interacts most strongly with nearby restriction fragments and that interaction frequencies decrease precipitously for fragments located farther away. 	This inverse relationship between interaction frequency and genomic distance is expected for a flexible chromatin fiber in the absence of any specific long-range looping interactions (13,24,34–36). Specific long-range looping interactions would result in peaks of interaction frequency super-imposed upon this background of interactions. 
PMC2910055	GM06990	Specific long-range looping interactions would result in peaks of interaction frequency super-imposed upon this background of interactions. 	We conclude that in GM06990 cells, the promoter does not engage in specific interactions with elements located in the surrounding 460 kb (Figure 1A). Figure 1.Chromosome conformation capture (3C) reveals four elements that interact with the CFTR transcription start site. 	All experiments used EcoRI to digest the chromatin. Interaction frequencies between the CFTR transcription start site and a 460 kb surrounding region are determined by 3C. 
PMC2910055	GM06990	3C data can be found in Supplementary Table S2.

(C) 3C profile of HeLa S3 cells (black circles) which express the CFTR gene, and HepG2 cells (white circles), which do not express the gene. 
PMC2910055	GM06990	Moreover, these interactions are observed only in CFTR expressing cells (Caco2, HT29 and HeLa S3) and not in non-expressing cells (K562 and HepG2). 	Interestingly, GM06990 cells do not display these long-range interactions, yet express CFTR at a very low, but detectable, level. 	Thus, the correlation between CFTR expression and looping between the promoter and these distal elements is not absolute (see ‘Discussion’ section). Analysis of digestion efficiency confirmed that these frequent interactions are not due to more efficient digestion of the corresponding restriction sites, consistent with many other studies that showed that digestion efficiency is not a major contributor to variation in 3C interaction frequencies [data not shown; (24,38–40)]. 
PMC2910055	GM06990	To determine whether any long-range interactions occur between the looping elements we identified above, we again employed 3C analysis. 	First, we performed 3C analyses anchored on the elements I, II (anchored on the restriction fragment located 20-kb upstream of the TSS), III and IV in Caco2 and GM06990 cells (Figure 2). 	As expected, we find that these elements interact frequently with nearby restriction fragments in both cell lines. In addition, these elements interact frequently with the CFTR promoter fragment in Caco2 cells, but not in GM06990 cells.

In addition, these elements interact frequently with the CFTR promoter fragment in Caco2 cells, but not in GM06990 cells. 	Elements I and II do appear to interact with elements III and IV, as minor peaks at the corresponding locations are visible (Figure 2A and C), although these interactions are considerably less frequent than their interaction with the promoter fragment. Interestingly, in Caco2 cells, elements III and IV are found to interact prominently with each other, as strong peaks of interaction frequencies are readily detected between the two restriction fragments (Figure 2E and G). 
PMC2910055	GM06990	Interestingly, in Caco2 cells, elements III and IV are found to interact prominently with each other, as strong peaks of interaction frequencies are readily detected between the two restriction fragments (Figure 2E and G). 	In GM06990 cells we did not detect any obvious peaks in the 3C interaction profiles, suggesting that there are no specific looping interactions between these elements in that cell line. 	We note that interactions obtained with all four anchor elements are generally higher in Caco2 cells as compared to GM06990 cells throughout the region, which is as predicted for a locus that is more compact as a result of long-range looping interactions (34). We conclude that in Caco2 cells elements I–IV not only interact with the CFTR promoter fragment but also associate with each other, although somewhat less frequently. Figure 2.3C interaction profiles for each of the four elements.

PMC2910055	GM06990	We also see a peak between the promoter fragment and a 1560 bp fragment, located near the 3′-end of the original 6069 EcoRI fragment containing element IV (Figures 3B and 4B). 	These interactions were not observed in GM06990 cells. 	These results confirm the presence of looping elements at these locations, and further define the positions of these elements. Based on the two independent 3C analyses performed with EcoRI and BsrGI, we conclude that element III is contained within an 806-bp BsrGI–EcoRI fragment and that element IV is contained within the 1560 bp BsrGI restriction fragment (Figure 4A).

PMC2910055	GM06990	In addition, regulatory elements, e.g. enhancers, have been found to display characteristic histone modifications including increased levels of acetylation and high levels of histone H3 monomethylation at the fourth lysine residue (H3K4Me1). 	The CFTR locus was selected for study by the ENCODE pilot project and as part of this consortium we generated extensive data related to chromatin structure and modification (publicly available at http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/). Figure 4 shows our ENCODE data representing DNase I hypersensitivity (in Caco2, GM06990 and HeLa S3 cells) and a variety of histone modifications (as detected in GM06990 and HeLa S3 cells) for the genomic regions containing elements III and IV. 	Strikingly, the minimal regions containing elements III and IV (indicated by vertical lines in Figure 4) coincide precisely with the presence of DHSs. These hypersensitive sites are found in CFTR expressing cells (Caco2 and HeLa S3), but not in GM06990 or HepG2 cells.

These comparisons strongly suggest that elements III and IV contain functional elements, and indicate that our 3C-based element discovery approach identified bona fide CFTR regulatory elements. DISCUSSION 
PMC2910055	GM06990	One possible explanation is that in Caco2 cells additional transcription factors and/or co-regulators bind these elements to further activate the gene. 	We also point out that the long-range looping interactions between the CFTR promoter and elements I–IV are not required for a low level of expression, as GM06990 cells express very low, but detectable, levels of CFTR while none of these long-range interactions are detected. 	It is possible that this low level is simply due to basal promoter activity or is the result of long-range interactions with other distal regulatory element. For instance, we find that in GM06990 cells the promoter is interacting with the enhancer element in intron 1 (Supplementary Figure S2).

Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that immortalized cell lines such as GM06990 display somewhat altered expression patterns as compared to the primary cells of origin. The four elements we uncovered in our 3C analysis interact with the CFTR promoter in all three CFTR expressing cells.

Another reason is that restorer in the natural germplasm population is sparse for the pol-CMS line, but popular for the nap-CMS line, implying that nap cytoplasm is more accommodated evolutionarily than pol cytoplasm.

PMC3265175	rs3211883	We included 349 Japanese AMD patients (210 PCV, 139 tAMD) and 198 age-matched controls. 	Four tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—rs10499862, rs3173798, rs3211883, and rs3173800—in the CD36 region were genotyped using the TaqMan assay.

PMC3265175	rs3173798	Results 	Although none of the SNPs tested were associated with PCV, the allelic frequencies of rs3173798 and rs3173800 were significantly different between PCV and tAMD patients. 	Genotype association analysis demonstrated different associations of these two SNPs between PCV and tAMD in the genotype model. Haplotype analysis revealed that the association of the major haplotype (T-T-T-T) at four selected SNPs in CD36 differed significantly between PCV and tAMD patients.

PMC3265175	rs3173798	We previously demonstrated the association of coding variants in the CD36 region with the incidence of neovascular AMD (corresponding to tAMD in the present report) in the Japanese population [23]. 	In that study, two variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—rs3173798 and rs3211883 on introns 3 and 4, which have high linkage disequilibrium—showed the greatest association with susceptibility to neovascular AMD. 	However, it has not been determined whether this association is general to all exudative AMD or specific for tAMD. We hypothesized that the genetic variants in CD36 may be differently associated with genetic susceptibilities to tAMD and PCV.

PMC3265175	rs3173798	The biologic basis of the association with the haplotype in CD36 is currently unknown, because the haplotype in the present study does not reside in the coding sequence of CD36. 	FASTSNP [40] gave the information that rs3173798 is located at splicing site with medium-high effect, but it was not shown whether it is located at splice donor site or acceptor site [41]. 	Thus, the SNPs in this region could have noncoding effects on gene expression and function.

Since the C allele at rs3173798 was less frequent in the tAMD group than the PCV and control groups, the reduced expression of CD36 might be correlated with tAMD but not PCV pathogenesis.

PMC3378692	rs4504543	Supporting a role in airway disease, the AOAH gene has previously been implicated in a genome wide scan for asthma [13]. 	Corresponding to the above literature, here we presented that rs4504543 in the AOAH gene played a protective role (OR = 0.58) in CRS with a strong P value (P = 0.0001152). 	Moreover, the AOAH_ rs4504543 loci was also revealed as a protective factor (OR = 0.30) in CRSsNP group with a stronger P value (P = 8.11–011), indicating that AOAH gene might exert a crucial protective role in the development of CRS. RYBP is a zinc finger protein with an essential role during embryonic development, which binds transcriptional factors, polycomb products, and mediators of apoptosis, suggesting roles in apparently,unrelated functions.

RYBP is a zinc finger protein with an essential role during embryonic development, which binds transcriptional factors, polycomb products, and mediators of apoptosis, suggesting roles in apparently,unrelated functions. Gene products of the RYBP gene inhibit ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TP53, and, by interacting with MDM2, play a role in regulating transcription of TP53 target genes and promoting apoptosis. 
PMC3378692	rs4532099	This may contribute to the inflammation observed in CRS, promoting epithelial dysfunction with secondary bacterial colonization. 	In contrast to AOAH gene, polymorphisms in the RYBP gene was exhibited here for the first time as a significantly risk factor of CRS and either of the subgroups (CRSsNP and CRSwNP) with high OR values (ORCRS = 2.59; ORCRSsNP = 2.76; ORCRSwNP = 2.45), suggesting the variation of rs4532099 in RYBP could increase the risk of CRS development. 	IL1RL1 gene is involved in regulation of TLR signaling and has recently also been implicated as the receptor for IL-33. Its role in development of CRS may be via interfering with TLR signaling, or via an alteration of IL-33 homeostasis. 
PMC3448601	rs1799793	Mutations in the XPD gene can completely prevent DNA opening and dual incision, steps that lead to the repair of DNA adducts [15]. 	Two common non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the coding region of the XPD gene have been identified: a G→A substitution causing exon 10 codon 312 Asp to be exchanged for Asn (Asp312Asn, D312N, G23592A, rs1799793) and an A→C substitution causing exon 23 codon 751 Lys to be substituted for Gln (Lys751Gln, L751Q, A35931C, rs13181) [16], [17]. 	These two polymorphisms are associated with lower DNA repair capacity and a higher level of DNA adducts [17], [18]. Several epidemiologic studies have examined associations between SNPs in DNA repair genes, mostly non-synonymous SNPs in XPD gene with potential functional significance and risk of PCa [19]–[26].

Folding of Dye-labeled Apoflavodoxins Involves a Stable Intermediate Participation of a folding intermediate is observed during folding of apoflavodoxin that is labeled with a donor and an acceptor label, as the following data show. Figures 3a to 3c present fluorescence emission intensities of tryptophan, A488, and of A568 during denaturant-dependent equilibrium folding of doubly dye-labeled protein. 
PMC3448718	1YOB	14.8 Å 	The distances reported are between C7a of the tryptophan indicated and Cα of the residue to be dye-labeled, as measured by using PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC, Palo Alto, Ca, USA) and the crystal structure of A. vinelandii flavodoxin (pdb ID 1YOB [56]). 	Tryptophan fluorescence data show that the unfolded baselines of the folding curves of ‘donor-only’ apoflavodoxin and d69-a1 coincide. Hence, in unfolded protein no FRET from tryptophans to A568 occurs, as apparently their spatial separation exceeds twice the corresponding Förster distance.

PMC3466216	3L0A	The structure of the AddB/Cas4 nuclease family has intriguing similarities to a family of putative nucleases found in bacteria and bacteriophages, typified by the protein EUBREC_2131 of Eubacterium rectale, a member of the DUF3799 protein family. 	Recently, a crystal structure of this protein (PDB code 3L0A) has been deposited in the protein data bank by a structural genomics consortium. 	Although as yet undescribed, the structure clearly shows the same arrangement of four cysteine residues forming a metal ligand, coupled with a RecB nuclease structure that is closely related to the RecE exonuclease of E. coli [23] (Figure 6). However, in this protein structure the FeS cluster has been replaced with a zinc ion.

PMC3597981	602113	The MLL nomenclature: more trouble than it's worth? 	MLL2 (MIM 602113; NM_003482, chromosome 12q13.12), a gene encoding a histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase of the trithorax group, has recently become of high interest for clinical and molecular genetics since the identification of de novo dominant MLL2 mutations as the major cause of Kabuki syndrome 1. 	Previously, a significant amount of research had already been dedicated to enzymes of chromatin-modifying function involved in various processes of transcriptional regulation in development and physiological states. However, the correct correlation and interpretation of these scientific findings are hindered by a major confusion in gene nomenclature that needs to be resolved. 
PMC3597981	NM_014727	In particular the mouse orthologue of the human chromosome 12 gene (MGI: 2682319, chromosome 15), which is approved as Mll2 by the Mouse Genomic Nomenclature Committee (MGNC), has been frequently referred to as Mll4 in the literature, for example in a paper by Cho et al. describing a protein complex with H3K4 methyltransferase activity (ASCOM) that actually contains Mll2, Mll3 and several other binding partners 3. 	The designation MLL4 is currently ascribed to the human chromosome 19 gene at the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu; accession number NM_014727), but this name is not approved by the HGNC. 	Currently, there is no gene in human or mouse approved as MLL4. The mouse orthologue of the human chromosome 19 gene is assigned as Wbp7 (MGI: 109565, chromosome 7) and its gene product sometimes referred to as MLL4 (see UCSC genome browser).

PMC3662784	rs8099917	All of the enrolled patients had over 5 log copies/ml HCV-RNA and genotype 1b HCV RNA. 	Thirteen patients had the hetero/minor IL28B allele (T/G) (rs8099917) that was reported to be a marker of patients difficult-to-treat with Peg-IFN/RBV therapy [29]. 	Twenty-nine patients had the major homo IL28B allele (T/T) that was reported to be favorable for achieving SVR [29]. Therefore, we compared the viral dynamics between subjects treated with the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV and subjects receiving the Peg-IFN/RBV with the same IL28B polymorphism (Fig. 2A and B).

The model was improved manually using the program COOT (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004 ▶) and was refined using the program REFMAC (Brünger et al., 1998 ▶).

Results and discussion   Structure of the hFABP3–ANS complex   
PMC3795557	2ans	In particular, the aniline and naphthalene group of ANS is surrounded by the side-chains of Phe16, Tyr19, Met20, Leu23, Val25, Thr29, Pro38, Phe57, Lys58, Leu104, Leu115 and Leu117 through hydrophobic interactions, in a manner similar to that previously observed for four FAs (Fig. 3c  ▶) (Zanotti et al., 1992 ▶; Young et al., 1994 ▶). 	Another important feature in the binding site is that the crystal structure of the hFABP3–ANS complex clearly revealed four water molecules, which were not observed in the binding cavity of a mouse FABP4 (mFABP4) complex structure with ANS (PDB code 2ans) (Ory & Banaszak, 1999 ▶) and of the hFABP3 complex structures with C16 or C18 FAs (Zanotti et al., 1992 ▶; Young et al., 1994 ▶). 	Through these solvent molecules, the negative sulfonate group of the ANS molecule interacts with the side-chains of Thr40, Thr53, Arg106, Arg126 and Tyr128 by forming a hydrogen-bonding cluster (Fig. 3c  ▶). However, in the FA complex, the carboxylate group of the four FAs (palmitate, oleate, stearate and elaidate) forms direct hydrogen-bond interactions with the side-chains of Arg126 and Tyr128 (Zanotti et al., 1992 ▶; Young et al., 1994 ▶).

PMC3808222	rs6489630	Results 	We found a significant association between rs6332 and the total group of AD patients (p = 0.013) and significant associations between both rs6332 (p = 0.033) and rs6489630 (p = 0.035) and early-onset AD patients. 	Conclusion These results suggest that NTF-3 SNPs may not only be associated with AD itself, but also with early-onset AD in Japanese patients, assuming that the NTF-3 gene may have age-related effects on neurodegenerative diseases. 
PMC3808222	rs6489630	Among the candidate genes in the neurotrophin family, Kunugi et al. [23] found that a missense mutation (Gly/-63/Glu) in the NTF-3 gene was associated with a risk of AD; however, its mutant type (-63 Glu) was too rare in Caucasian populations to be investigated in subsequent studies in other countries [23,26]. 	On the other hand, NTF-3 has been reported to be a strong candidate gene for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in which social cognition is impaired as a core symptom in the neurodevelopmental course [27]. NTF-3 SNPs (rs6332 and rs6489630) are functional polymorphisms located at chromosome 12p13 and are significantly associated with the severity of ADHD and intelligence (i.e. selective attentional tasks and performance execution) [28,29]. 	A silent polymorphism, rs6332, is located within Pro-NTF-3 gene exon 1 and influences the executive function in patients with limited mild-stage AD, but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [20]. The rs4930767 polymorphism in the promoter region of the same gene does not appear to be associated with any measure of ADHD [29].

The rs4930767 polymorphism in the promoter region of the same gene does not appear to be associated with any measure of ADHD [29]. 	Based on these studies, the neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative associated gene, NTF-3, may influence the age-related effects during the course of the disease, and such confounding effects should be considered when comparing the disease group and the normal control (NC) group. In the present study, we hypothesized that representative NTF-3 SNPs (rs6332, rs6489630, and rs4930767) might be associated with a risk of AD in Japanese subjects, a topic that is of particular interest in view of Japan's aging society.

Thus, to investigate the association between AD and NTF-3 SNPs without age as a confounding factor, we statistically compared the allele frequencies of 3 SNPs between AD patients and age-matched NCs. Moreover, to compare these 2 groups under stricter or more limited age-matched conditions, we selected only the early-onset sample (<65 years) from the total sample (age range, 32-72 years) in the second stage of the analysis [9].

Discussion In the present study, we found significant differences in the allele frequencies of the NTF-3 SNPs between patients with AD and the NCs and between the EAD group (<65 years) and age-matched NCs (tables 2, 4). 
PMC3808222	rs6489630	In the present study, we found significant differences in the allele frequencies of the NTF-3 SNPs between patients with AD and the NCs and between the EAD group (<65 years) and age-matched NCs (tables 2, 4). 	While the A allele of rs6332 was associated with a risk of AD and EAD (former: OR = 1.602, 95% CI = 1.114-2.304; latter: OR = 1.631, 95% CI = 1.045-2.545), the T allele of rs6489630 was associated with a protective role only for EAD (OR = 0.566, 95% CI = 0.335-0.955). 	We could not find a significant association between rs4930767 and the manifestation of AD (tables 1, 2, 3, 4). In previous studies, rs6332 was reported to be a robust candidate gene polymorphism for ADHD and to influence intelligence [27,29]. 
PMC3808222	rs4930767	While the A allele of rs6332 was associated with a risk of AD and EAD (former: OR = 1.602, 95% CI = 1.114-2.304; latter: OR = 1.631, 95% CI = 1.045-2.545), the T allele of rs6489630 was associated with a protective role only for EAD (OR = 0.566, 95% CI = 0.335-0.955). 	We could not find a significant association between rs4930767 and the manifestation of AD (tables 1, 2, 3, 4). 	In previous studies, rs6332 was reported to be a robust candidate gene polymorphism for ADHD and to influence intelligence [27,29]. We found that the executive function of G allele carriers was significantly lower than that of A allele carriers among AD patients. 
PMC3808222	rs6489630	On the other hand, rs6332 might be associated with the manifestation of AD in patients with EAD. 	Similarly, rs6489630 was reportedly associated with the intelligence of subjects with ADHD, and the intelligence scores of T allele carriers were significantly lower than those of C allele carriers [28]. 	In contrast, the present results indicate a predominantly protective role associated with the T allele, compared with C allele carriers, with regard to the manifestation of EAD. Thus, functional SNPs of neurotrophins might have age-related reversible influences clinically between the young and the elderly, similar to the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism [33]. 
PMC3808222	rs6489630	Therefore, rs6332 might influence synonymous polymorphisms that in turn might impact the regional translational level of NTF-3, leading to the regulation of cholinergic neuron projections. 	The rs6489630 SNP is located in an intron on the 3′-side, but its functional roles (e.g. transcriptional regulation of the NTF-3 gene) remain unclear and require further examination in the future. 	The present study has some limitations. First, the sample size in this study was comparatively small. 
PMC3808222	rs4930767	First, the sample size in this study was comparatively small. 	Therefore, the statistical values were also small, and some type II errors may have occurred, possibly resulting in the failure to detect a significant association between rs4930767 and the risk of AD. 	To match the age (age range, 32-72 years) between the AD patients and NCs, we selected only 248 of the 507 participants. Moreover, we could not compare the relation between late-onset AD patients (>65 years) and age-matched NCs because the sample size was too small (n = 85).

Alleles of rs158830, located within the promoter region of MET, have been of particular interest because of their effects on transcription and protein expression of MET. 	The presence of the “C” allele of rs158830 has been associated with more severe deficits in social function and communication (Campbell et al., 2010). Rudie et al. (2012) measured the impact of the rs158830 risk allele on structural and functional brain development in a population of 162 children and adolescents with (n = 75) and without (n = 87) ASD.

Tetraticopeptide 4 (TTC4) is another TPR domain protein and was originally discovered in a screen for loss of heterozygosity in the chromosomal 1p31 region associated with breast cancer and was thus implicated as a tumor suppressor gene [148, 149]. 	TTC4 appears to function in the nucleus and has been implicated as a component of a complex containing the histone acetyltransferase MYST/MOF and in the assembly of transcriptional initiation factor TFIIIB [149–152]. TTC4 is also a potential Hsp90 binding protein and appears to have an important role in linking Hsp90 function to replication [153], TTC4 may thus have a role in multiple nuclear functions including transcription and replication and these may be linked to its tumor suppressor properties.

PMC3871159	NCT00477204	Therefore, the present data suggests that pharmacological agents targeting cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols, may be more effective to reduce plasma cholesterol and reduce CVD risk in type 1 diabetic individuals than agents singularly targeting cholesterol synthesis, such as statins. 	The outcomes of current clinical trials testing this hypothesis may provide answers (ClinicalTrials.gov registrations NCT00477204 and NCT00879710). 	In previous reports, cholesterol synthesis was lower in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to both non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects [16]–[18]. Discrepancies between the current report and previous investigations may be due to differences in methodology as well as patient selection.

The Vietnamese patients (n=83) (Table 1) were randomly selected from a larger number of subjects (n=640) who were part of a randomized controlled trial in northeastern Vietnam between 2008 and 2011, which assessed the effect of peer support on treatment failure (registration number: NCT01433601) [12]. 	The selected 83 patients had similar demographic and laboratory characteristics as the whole cohort (data not shown). Twenty-four subjects had ongoing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed two months before inclusion in the study and had been given tuberculostatics for two months (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide), with an efficient therapeutic response to the TB therapy, before starting ART [stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) plus nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV)]. 
PMC3904806	rs59072263	We found a novel association between intraocular pressure and a common variant at 7p21 near to GLCCI1 and ICA1. 	The findings in this region were confirmed through two UK replication cohorts totalling 4866 individuals (rs59072263, Pcombined = 1.10 × 10−8). 	A copy of the G allele at this SNP is associated with an increase in mean IOP of 0.45 mmHg (95%CI = 0.30–0.61 mmHg). These results lend support to the implication of vesicle trafficking and glucocorticoid inducibility pathways in the determination of intraocular pressure and in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma.

Imputation of genotypes by the Rotterdam group at rs59072263, using MACH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) and the 1000 Genomes data, was also attempted but showed weaker evidence of association (one-sided P-value = 0.178), However, unlike the discovery data and TwinsUK data, which had imputation accuracy (‘IMPUTE info’ and ‘MACH r2’, respectively) of 0.95 and 0.89 at rs59072263, the largest component of the Dutch meta-analysis, comprising almost two-thirds of the study, had MACH r2 < 0.75.

PMC3928295	2CHT	Starting structures for Chorismate Mutase were obtained from Steinmann et al. [21] who prepared the structures following Claeyssens et al. [28]. 	The preparation can be summarized as follows: The experimental structure of Chorismate Mutase was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 2CHT) and protonated using PDB2PQR at pH 7. 	The inhibitors were manually replaced with Chorismate in the reactant state. The complexes were simulated in GROMACS with the CHARMM27 force field at 300K. 
PMC3951450	U39455	This cassette was inserted between the XmaI and SalI restriction sites of plasmid pLW-44 [29] (kindly provided by Prof B. Moss, NIH) to produce plasmid pDEST44-TPA-V5. 	The M segment nucleic acid sequence of CCHF strain IbAr10200 (Accession number U39455) was modified by removal of untranslated regions, initiation and termination codons. 	To enable Gateway recombination, attB1 and attB2 sequences were added to the beginning and end, respectively, of the remaining open reading frame (i.e. nucleotides 34 to 5082). Two poxvirus transcription stop signals (TTTTTNT) at positions 3894 and 4767 were altered without introducing coding changes. 
PMC3951450	NM_013556	Each sample was also analysed for levels of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene. 	A one-step RT-PCR with singleplex detection was performed targeting an 89 bp product in the mouse HPRT gene (NCBI Reference sequence NM_013556) using the QuantiFast probe assay (Qiagen) and the ABi 7500 RT-PCR platform. 	All reactions were run in triplicate. To normalise the CCHFv expression data, CT values for CCHFv and HPRT were each inverted by subtracting the CT value from 45 (the total number of cycles), where CT is the number of cycles required to reach the fluorescence threshold value. 
PMC3953389	1KNY	A DALI [21] search for the structural homologs of VBP C-terminal domain identified several proteins with a HEPN domain (Table S1); this confirmed that the C-terminal domain of VBP adopts a HEPN fold (hereafter referred to as HEPN domain). 	Notably, the HEPN domain of VBP aligns with the C-terminal domain of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase from Staphylococcus aureus (PDB code: 1KNY) with an rmsd of 2.9 Å for the 104 Cα atoms. 	Although VBP has very low sequence identity (14 to 16%) with its structural homologs, it might have similar nucleotide binding and transfer function. VBP is a dimer 
PMC3953389	1KNY	Proteins homologous to VBP are predicted to bind ATP [22]. 	A previously reported structure of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (PDB code: 1KNY), a structural homolog of VBP, in complex with an ATP analog and kanamycin, shows that the nucleotide binding pocket involves residues from the N-terminal domain of one monomer and the C-terminal domain of the second monomer. 	We verified the ATP binding property of VBP using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Figure 7A and Table S2). The ITC analysis showed that VBP binds to the ATP analog (AMPPNP) (Kd = 2.0 µM), whereas VBP with the three point substitutions described above does not bind to AMPPNP (Figure 7B, Figure S9A and S9B), indicating that only dimeric VBP binds to ATP. 
PMC3953389	1KNY	We infer that, similar to the kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, the ATP binding in VBP might involve both N-terminal and C-terminal domains. 	Notably, the structure of the kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (PDB code: 1KNY) complexed with a nucleotide analog and kanamycin shows that the two monomers of the dimer interact in an anti-parallel fashion to form the ATP binding pocket. 	Similarly, the structure of the HEPN domain from VBP shows that the two HEPN monomers form a tight dimer in which the monomers run in anti-parallel. Although the relative orientation of monomers in the dimers of both proteins is not the same, both proteins might have a similar ATP-binding mechanism. 
PMC3953389	DQ058764.1	Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. 	A fragment of virF cassette cloned from pTiBo542 (GenBank: DQ058764.1) was inserted into the SphI–ApaI site on pCB301 [27]. 	The virF coding sequence was substituted with a multiple cloning site, resulting in pQH300. Protein expression and purification 
PMC3953389	4NQF	Subsequently, the importance of the key residues at the dimeric interface was validated by structure-based in vitro studies, such as analytical ultracentrifugation and pull down assays, and in vivo plant virulence studies. 	Coordinates of HEPN domain of VBP have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org) under accession code 4NQF. 	Analytical ultracentrifugation The oligomeric state of full-length VBP, HEPN and NTD domain of VBP and their mutants was investigated by monitoring the sedimentation properties of each protein in sedimentation velocity experiments.

PMC3969379	3hx4	Direct reconstruction of the implied high-(Ca2+) conformational state in solution yields a model that is distinctly different from the reconstruction of the low-(Ca2+) state. 	The correlation between the observed scattering curve and that predicted from a crystal structure of the homologous calcium-bound TgCDPK1 (PDB 3hx4) is cc = 0.83. 	The most likely explanation for the less compact state observed for the high-(Ca2+) conformation of NcCDPK1 as measured in solution when compared to that of TgCDPK1 as seen in a crystal is that in solution the rearranged secondary structural elements of the Ca2+-binding domain exhibit sufficient flexibility for the protein to adopt a range of conformational states. Only a single relatively compact state from this range is favored, or stabilized, during formation of the crystal lattice.

PMC4128746	X90822	In addition to these taxa, an OTU (NB_Bamo_04) related to the unidentified amoA gene cluster consisting of clones retrieved from potash-polluted marsh soil [51] was found in three relict niter-bed soils (Fig. 2 and Table S6). 	This cluster has a significantly low identity with previously reported bacterial amoA gene sequences (e.g., NB_BamoA_04 had 77.4% identity with Nitrosospira multiformis strain C-71, accession no. X90822), suggesting that phylogenetically novel AOB may play a role in ammonia oxidation in some niter-bed ecosystems. 	The similarity of AOB compositions in relict niter-bed soils was compared with previously reported amoA gene-based microbial community analysis [14]. PCoA and jackknife analyses showed that soil bacterial amoA libraries were separated into two groups according to their pH: seven niter-bed soils were clustered into group B1 with two Austrian arable and riparian forest soils (pH 7.05–8.35), and the remaining two soils, from an Austrian spruce forest and a Costa-Rican rain forest, were clustered into group B2 (pH 4.36–4.63) (Fig. 3A). 
PMC4128746	FR773159	Thus, the results from amoA-based pyrotag analysis expanded the biodiversity of AOA in relict niter-bed soils. 	The most abundant OTU in OVA1 and OVA2 soils was NB_Aamo_02, which was categorized into subcluster 4.1 of “Ca. Nitrososphaera” and was distantly related to previously characterized AOA (77.8% sequence identity with “Ca. Nitrososphaera viennensis” strain EN76, accession no. FR773159), whereas the most abundant OTU in the other seven samples (NB_Aamo_01) was closely related to “Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis” strain Ga9.2 (90.6% sequence identity, accession no. CP002408) and categorized into subcluster 1.1. 	This marked difference in a major AOA population within OVA soils was clearly associated with the maximum nitrification rate of bulk soil (Table S1) [13]. This finding also implies that the nitrification activity and/or affinity for ammonia may differ between subclusters 1.1 and 1.4.

PMC4393062	1hy5	Docking studies were conducted on the target protein YopE. 	Coordinates of YopE (PDB id: 1hy5, [24]) were obtained from RCSB Protein Data Bank [54]. 	The biological assembly is known to be a monomer, and therefore, one YopE chain from the crystal dimer structure was prepared and refined using the Protein Preparation Wizard. Charges and bond orders were assigned, hydrogens were added to the heavy atoms, selenomethionines were converted to methionines, and all waters were deleted. 
PMC4393062	1g4u	Binding selectivity of selected hits to ExoSGAP and SptPGAP was investigated. 	Their 3D structures were taken from the Protein Data Bank (Pdb ID: 1g4u for SptPGAP and Pdb id: 1he1 for ExoSGAP) prepared in Maestro workspace, and their binding site grids were generated for all-atom docking calculations, as described in receptor protein preparation and receptor grid generation sections. 	By centering the key arginine residues and keeping the previous docking parameters identical, Glide XP docking was performed on ExoSGAP and SptPGAP. The results reveal that the selected nine hits have higher average ligand strain and lower binding affinity toward ExoSGAP and SptPGAP in terms of docking scores (Table 6).

PMC4423106	NM_001993	One obvious manifestation of cancer-associated coagulopathy is the increased risk of venous thrombosis (VT) among cancer patients [2-4], however, the procoagulant state may also promote tumor progression [5]. 	Full-length tissue factor (TF) [GenBank: NM_001993] is the most extensively studied coagulation factor in cancer, and its activity is regulated by TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI). 	Expression of both TF and TFPI has been detected in tissues and cell lines of several human cancers including breast cancer [6-10], suggesting a role in cancer biology. TF is known to be a trigger of angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and to prevent apoptosis [11-14]. 
PMC4423106	NM_006287	These effects may either be coagulation dependent, indirectly through fibrin formation and platelet activation, or through coagulation independent signaling via factor VIIa (FVIIa) and activation of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), enhanced by β1 integrin [5,12]. 	Full-length TFPI (TFPIα) [GenBank: NM_006287] consists of three Kunitz-type inhibitor domains and a positively charged carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) end, while the alternatively spliced TFPIβ [GenBank: NM_001032281] lacks the third Kunitz domain and has a unique C-terminal that directs binding to a glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI) anchor on the cell surface [15]. 	There is growing evidence for non-hemostatic tumor-suppressive activities of TFPI. Studies of endothelial cell cultures have shown that recombinant TFPIα induces apoptosis [16], inhibits proliferation via the very low density lipoprotein receptor [17], and show anti-angiogenic and anti-migratory properties [18,19].

PMC4423106	rs8176541	Although the precise role for these SNP associations is still to be elucidated, this study pinpoints the importance of focusing on breast cancer heterogeneity, as in a recent study we found that the frequencies of TFPI SNPs in a group of breast cancer patients with all subtypes combined (n = 366), were no different from healthy control subjects [45]. 	Some of the SNPs that followed distinct clinical groups (rs3213739, rs8176479, rs2192824, rs8176541 and rs10153820) also correlated with total TFPI (α + β), TFPIα or TFPIβ tumor mRNA expression, or total TFPI plasma levels. 	Certain SNPs with a regulatory effect on total TFPI plasma levels also associated with triple-negative status (rs8176541, rs3213739, rs8176479 and rs2192824) and tumor size (rs10153820), thereby providing a possible mechanistic rationale for why total TFPI levels were decreased in patients with triple-negative and larger tumors. However, the exact mechanism(s) by which these SNPs regulate TFPI protein levels demand experimental verification.

PMC4423106	NM_001178096	Yet another study failed to detect any correlation between breast tumor-expressed TF and HR status, node status, grade or tumor size [10]. 	Kocatürk et al., found that both flTF and alternatively spliced TF (asTF) [GenBank:NM_001178096] were associated with increasing tumor grade, while asTF was also associated with increasing breast tumor size [6], suggesting that the clinical significance of asTF is at least as important as that of flTF. 	Consequently, future studies addressing TF in relation to cancer should include the different forms of TF (that is, asTF and flTF [6,49], cryptic versus active TF [50], and phosphorylated TF [10]). Also noteworthy; methodological discrepancies in measuring TF may to some extent account for the conflicting results among studies addressing TF in cancer (for example, mRNA versus protein and use of different TF detection antibodies).

PMC4521678	NCT01881230	The recommended doses and schedules of single-agent nab-paclitaxel by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the systemic treatment of recurrent or MBC are 260 mg/m2 q3w and 100 or 150 mg/m2 qw 3/4.45 Currently, the NCCN does not recommend a nab- paclitaxel-based combination regimen for the treatment of any type of breast cancer. 	Very few treatment options exist for patients with TNBC, an aggressive disease that accounts for about 20% to 25% of all breast cancer.46 Patients with metastatic TNBC tend to be resistant to single-agent chemotherapy and often require combination chemotherapy.45 Independent trials have demonstrated activity of nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin, gemcitabine, or bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic TNBC.41,42,47 The Phase II/III Triple-Negative Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel Combination International Treatment Study (tnAcity; NCT01881230) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (or carboplatin) versus gemcitabine plus carboplatin as first-line treatment of patients with TNBC (Table 2).48 During the Phase II portion of the trial, the best combination partner for nab-paclitaxel will be determined (gemcitabine or carboplatin) and carried forward into the Phase III trial where the selected nab-paclitaxel regimen will be compared with gemcitabine plus carboplatin. 	Planned enrollment for this trial is 790 patients and the primary endpoint is PFS. There are a number of other ongoing Phase III/IV trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in various breast cancer settings, and these are listed in Table 2.49–54 
PMC4521678	NCT02151149	Other challenges in treating elderly patients include comorbidities and altered PK of drugs with age.61,62 As a result, patients above age 70 years with lung cancer tend to be undertreated due to lack of sufficient evidence. 	In a subset analysis of the Phase III NSCLC trial, it was found that elderly patients who were treated with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin had a nearly 10-month improvement in OS compared with patients treated with sb-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (P=0.009).16 The safety profile of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the elderly population was similar to the overall trial population.23 Based on this positive result, one of the Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel in NSCLC (ABOUND) Phase III trials, ABOUND.70+ (NCT02151149), will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin in elderly patients (aged ≥70 years) with advanced NSCLC (Table 2).63 Patients will be randomly assigned to either 100 mg/m2 weekly nab-paclitaxel given on day 1, 8, and 15 plus carboplatin AUC 6 given on day 1 every 21 days or the same regimen with 1 week off for a 28-day cycle. 	Planned enrollment is 284 patients. The primary endpoint is safety (incidence of peripheral neuropathy or myelosuppression). 
PMC4521678	NCT02027428	The primary endpoint is safety (incidence of peripheral neuropathy or myelosuppression). 	Squamous NSCLC portends a poorer prognosis compared with other non-squamous subtypes, with 1- and 5-year survival rates of 14.6% and 1.6%, respectively.64 Treatment options for patients with squamous NSCLC are also limited.65 Pemetrexed and bevacizumab are not indicated for these patients, and the known mutations targetable by currently approved agents are rare in squamous NSCLC.65 Current NCCN guidelines recommend platinum-based doublets as a category 1 option, and cisplatin plus vinorelbine in combination with cetuximab as a category 2B recommendation in patients with squamous NSCLC.65 In the Phase III NSCLC trial of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus sb-paclitaxel plus carboplatin, patients with squamous histology treated with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin achieved an ORR that was nearly double that of patients treated with sb-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (P<0.001).16 The safety profile of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with squamous histology was similar to the overall treated population of patients.16 This intriguing outcome provided the rationale for the Phase III ABOUND squamous maintenance trial (ABOUND.sqm; NCT02027428) that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel as maintenance therapy after first-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with stage IIIB/IV squamous-cell NSCLC (Table 2).66 After induction, patients will receive maintenance therapy of either nab-paclitaxel plus best supportive care or best supportive care alone.

PMC4521678	NCT01964430	There are limited options for adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer and no adjuvant regimen has received regulatory approval in the USA. 	The NCCN guidelines recommend 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin or gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy options, but for chemotherapy alone, gemcitabine is preferred over 5-FU/leucovorin based on its more favorable safety profile.67 Because a majority of patients receiving adjuvant gemcitabine relapse with recurrence rates in the range of 77% to 81% in Phase III trials, better treatment options are needed.68,69 The regimen used in the Phase III MPACT trial of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine is now being evaluated in the Phase III Adjuvant Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (APACT; NCT01964430) as adjuvant therapy for patients with resected pancreatic cancer (Table 2).70 Patients will be randomly assigned to receive 125 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 given on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle for a total of six cycles or gemcitabine alone. 	Planned enrollment is 800 patients and the primary endpoint is disease-free survival. Based on the positive results of the Phase III MPACT study, there has been a significant increase in the use of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as a backbone regimen, and several studies are evaluating this combination with other novel therapies, including immunotherapy as in the Phase III Immunotherapy Study in Borderline Resectable or Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer (PILLAR) trial (Table 2).71 As we move forward with this backbone regimen, future studies will likely address whether the qw 3/4 schedule, currently the FDA-approved schedule for MPC,3 will be optimal for regimens of nab-paclitaxel as a combination partner or as part of a novel sequence of regimens.

The only available COI sequence of Stenotaenia (KF569300.1), labelled as Stenotaenia sorrentina, was added to the dataset. 	In order to rule-out the accidental amplification of nuclear copies of the mitochondrial COI gene, the whole dataset was translated into amino acids following the ‘invertebrate’ code in MEGA6 (Tamura et al. 2013); internal stop codons were absent in our dataset. There were a total of 658 positions in the final dataset, gaps were absent. 
PMC4567078	KM588135	To investigate the role of Myo1b in PT cells, we used RNAi to kd Myo1b expression in OK 3B/2 cells. 	The sequence of Didelphis virginiana Myo1b was unknown, so we determined a partial cDNA sequence (GenBank KM588135) in order to design shRNA specific for kd of OK Myo1b (Fig 5A). 	In the 1662 base pairs cloned, Didelphis virginiana Myo1b is 85% identical to the rat Myo1b DNA sequence and 93% identical in amino acid sequence. Lentivirus-mediated expression of shRNA for at least three different sequences (243, 628, 891) resulted in a significant reduction in Myo1b expression (53% for 243; 80% for 628; 99% for 891) as determined by immunoblotting and densitometry (Fig 5B).

PMC4602985	D26607	Nitric oxide (NO), also known as “endothelial-derived relaxing factor,”11 is mostly produced by the catalyzing action of the 3 nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family enzymes via the conversion of L-arginine.12 It is a multifunctional molecule and participates in a large number of biological reactions, for example, active biological mediator in relaxing vascular smooth muscle in response to vasoactive substances and shear stress,11 vasodilatation maintenance the structure of the vessel wall,13 inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation,14 and platelet and monocyte adhesion.15,16 A substantial part of NO functions may participate in the mechanism of aneurysms formation and downregulation of NO level has been reported to be associated with several vascular diseases.17 	The 3 members of NOS family are neuronal (nNOS/NOS1), inducible (iNOS/NOS2), and endothelial (eNOS/NOS3).18 eNOS that is found primarily in the endothelium continuously generating NO serves to maintain basal vascular tone and cerebral blood flow, and its dysregulation may participate in the early development of aneurysms.19 eNOS is encoded by gene located on chromosome 7q35–36 that has 26 exons that span >21 kb of the genome (GenBank D26607).20 There are many functional polymorphisms in different regions of eNOS gene and several studies have been done to elucidate the relationships between polymorphisms and susceptibility of IAs. 	The T786C (rs2070744) is an important point mutation of thymine to cytosine at coden-786 in the 5′-flanking region of the eNOS gene, which could significantly reduce eNOS gene promoter activity and serum NO level21; G894T (Glu298Asp, rs1799983) corresponds to a Glu-Asp change at nucleotide 298 in exon 7 that demonstrated a trend for a reduced eNOS enzyme activity,22 and 27-bp-VNTR that is a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs, 27 bp) in intron 4 accounts influencing basal plasma NO generation.23 T786C, G894T, and 27-bp-VNTR were the 3 most clinically relevant IA-associated polymorphisms in the eNOS gene that have been reported. From 2003, these 3 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with IA risk in a number of case–control studies with conflicting conclusions.24–36 In this study, we performed meta-analyses and corresponding stratified analyses using currently available data to clarify the effects of eNOS T786C, G894T, and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms on the risk of IAs.

PMC4640238	rs3757441	This epigenetic modification is responsible for several key events in tumor development, including the occurrence of distant metastases and angiogenesis [6, 7]. 	We have recently investigated the role of EZH2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab: the C/C genotype for the rs3757441 SNP was associated with worse prognosis in terms of progression-free and overall survival [8]. 	This finding was subsequently confirmed in patients treated with chemotherapy alone, an evidence suggesting a prognostic significance of this SNP in mCRC [9]. We hypothesized that the C/C genotype would create a transcription factor-binding site, thereby increasing the expression of the oncogenic EZH2 protein [8].

PMC4640238	rs3757441	Discussion 	We have already reported about the association between the EZH2 rs3757441 C/C genotype and worse prognosis in mCRC [8, 9] and showed that EZH2 mRNA expression (as measured in peripheral lymphocytes) was significantly higher among C/C patients [8]. 	To characterize the role of this SNP in neoplastic cells, we analyzed EZH2 rs3757441 in normal colonic tissue (as the SNP accounts for germline variation in gene sequence) and evaluated EZH2 expression in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry in a series of 119 primary CRC. In this context, we found that the C/C genotype was associated with significantly higher EZH2 expression (Table 2).

PMC4640238	rs3757441	In this context, we found that the C/C genotype was associated with significantly higher EZH2 expression (Table 2). 	Potential mechanisms by which the rs3757441 SNP may affect EZH2 expression have been proposed elsewhere [8]. 	Intriguingly, we also observed a strong association between the C/C genotype and increased expression of H3K27me3, which is the functional readout of EZH2 methylating activity. This result indicates that carriers of the C/C genotype display higher EZH2 activity. 
PMC4640238	rs3757441	Our study has several limitations that should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. 	First, we retrieved only 5 patients with the C/C genotype for the EZH2 rs3757441 SNP: therefore, our findings cannot be considered definitive and further analyses should be conducted in larger patient cohorts to confirm the association between EZH2 SNP variants and protein expression. 	Notably, the results described in the present manuscript are in line with our previous report about mRNA analysis on peripheral lymphocytes from CRC patients [8]. This investigation revealed that EZH2 mRNA expression is higher in homozygous C allele carriers, with no difference between C/T and T/T subjects [8]. 
PMC4640238	rs3757441	In our opinion, these two investigations support further evaluation of this SNP in CRC and possibly in other malignancies. 	Indeed, other researchers have recently suggested the relevance of the rs3757441 EZH2 SNP in hepatocellular carcinoma: Yu et al. reported that patients who carried at least one C allele have a higher lymph-node-metastasis risk than did patients carrying the wild-type allele [16], thus confirming the potential functional relevance of this SNP in cancer cells. 	Secondly, a standardized score to evaluate EZH2 (and H3K27me3) positivity by immunohistochemistry is lacking: future studies should thus clarify which is the preferred method to assess this parameter (i.e. the percentage of positive cells, the intensity of staining or a combination of both, as for the SI proposed by other authors [13]). Conclusions 
PMC4640238	rs3757441	Conclusions 	To conclude, we characterized the EZH2 rs3757441 SNP, showing that the C/C variant is associated with higher EZH2 expression and activity in the neoplastic tissue. 	This SNP genotype has been linked with worse prognosis among mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy with or without an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody: our data confirm in primary tumors that the C allele is linked with increased EZH2 expression and activity, thus providing additional evidence for a functional relevance of this SNP in CRC biology. As anti-EZH2 drugs are under development and early clinical evaluation [17], this SNP may serve as a potential predictive biomarker for such agents in CRC patients.

As an example, rs4519508, associated with a 2.1cm decrease in height [50], is in a binding site for the cell-cycle regulator family E2F (Fig 6D). 	Our annotation increased the PPA from a baseline of 10.5% to 44.4%, and it is the highest associated SNP in the association block (S21A Fig).

This E2F footprint is active in >300 tissues (most of them fetal) and we detected ASH at this SNP in lung fibroblasts, validating that the reference allele at rs4519508 confers stronger binding than the alternate. 	Interestingly, in the reporter assay we observed 1.5-fold increased expression in the presence of the alternate allele, suggesting that at this location, E2F is acting as a repressor. Finally, this SNP is located within the promoter of PPP3R1, a regulatory subunit of calcineurin important for cardiac and skeletal muscle phenotypes; and a SNP in the same region has been shown to be associated with endurance [51] in humans. 
PMC4764260	rs532436	The p-value of association for this GWAS locus (p = 8.1 × 10−6) does not reach genome-wide significance in the height meta-analysis data we used [50]; however, in a recent more extensive meta-analysis for height [52] this locus achieves genome-wide significance p = 8.4 × 10−10, demonstrating that our annotation can be useful to rescue relevant loci. 	Finally, a SNP associated with LDL levels, rs532436, is within a footprint for USF, an E-box motif (Fig 6C). 	Adding our annotation increased the PPA of the SNP from 39.7% to 94.7% (S21B Fig). We found that the alternate allele, associated with a 0.0785 mg/dL increase of LDL in the blood, is predicted to have a lower binding probability and results in 1.8-fold lower expression, compared to the reference allele.

PMC4797273	GM12878	We aligned and compared the profiles of DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase I), HMs and TF binding events by taking advantage of the wealth of data from the ENCODE project (23). 	Statistical tests showed a strong correlation between binding events and chromatin features across five human cell lines, including A549, GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562. 	To further demonstrate the relationship between binding events and chromatin features, we then examined predictive ability of chromatin features for TF–TF co-occupancy through a computational model. Our results showed that chromatin features are able to accurately predict the TF–TF co-occupancy genome-widely. 
PMC4797273	GM12878	The ENCODE project has generated TF binding data, by using ChIP-Seq technique (2), in both normal and cancer cell lines. 	Five human cell lines were selected in this study, including A549 (epithelial cells), GM12878 (B-lymphoblastoid cell), H1-hESC (embryonic stem cells), HepG-2 (hepatocellular carcinoma cells) and K562 (erythrocytic leukemia cells). 	TF binding profiles by ChIP-Seq data were obtained from the HAIB, and UW TFBS ENCODE groups. Genome-wide profiles of HMs, including H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1, H3K79me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H4K20me1, and the histone variant, H2A.z, were generated using the ChIP-Seq technique (2). 
PMC4797273	GM12878	Chromatin state segmentation data was also downloaded from the USCS Genome Browser. 	The chromatin states were defined using the unsupervised machine learning technique ChromHMM (36), and available for the GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cell lines. 	Determination of TF–TF co-occupying regions Based on the uniform processing pipeline developed for the ENCODE Integrative Analysis effort (37), the binding sites or each TF were determined by peak calling using the SPP peak caller (38) and the consistency and reproducibility between biological replicates with the measurement of the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR < 2%) (39), from the corresponding ChIP-Seq data. 
PMC4797273	GM12878	The chromatin features includes DNase I, 11 HMs and GC content. 	Starting with CTCF and YY1 binding events, the chromatin feature-based model enabled accurate predictions of co-occupancy, with AUC = 0.92 and 0.88 for CTCF–YY1 (distinguished from CTCF-only) and YY1–CTCF (distinguished from YY1-only) binding events, in the GM12878 cell line (Figure 3). 	High prediction accuracies were also achieved in the A549, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cells with AUC = 0.92 and 0.76, 0.81 and 0.85, 0.91 and 0.78, and 0.89 and 0.79, respectively (Supplementary Figure S6). The predictive ability of chromatin features were also demonstrated using ACC value estimations with an average of ACCs ∼0.80 for CTCF–YY1 and ∼0.75 for YY1–CTCF co-occupancy (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table S3). 
PMC4797273	GM12878	The predictive ability of chromatin features were also demonstrated using ACC value estimations with an average of ACCs ∼0.80 for CTCF–YY1 and ∼0.75 for YY1–CTCF co-occupancy (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table S3). 	Chromatin features are predictive of CTCF–YY1 co-occupancy from (A) CTCF-only and (B) YY1-only events with high accuracies in the GM12878 cell line. 	Left: ROC curves are shown with colors representing predictions using different chromatin features and AUC values are indicated in the legend; Middle: predictions evaluated with ACCs; and Right: predictions evaluated with AUC values using individual histone features. When using individual or a subset of chromatin features as predictors, the prediction accuracies obtained from DNase I and combined 11 HMs are closed to that using all features as a whole (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table S3). 
PMC4797273	GM12878	High prediction accuracies were generally achieved. 	For instance, the RF Classifier can achieve high predictions with AUC = 0.90 and 0.76, 0.89 and 0.87, 0.79 and 0.85, 0.91 and 0.78, and 0.89 and 0.79, respectively, in the A549, GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cells, when using all chromatin features as a predictor. 	Similar results were observed when using different chromatin features as predictors (Supplementary Figure S7). The linear model with NB and LDA gave accurate predictions from individual chromatin features, such as DNase I, which were similar to the results obtained from non-linear models. 
PMC4797273	GM12878	Chromatin features are predictive of (A) CTCF-TF and (B) TF-CTCF co-occupancy with high accuracies. 	Computational models were trained and applied to the same TF–TF pair in the same cell line, labeled by colors: black, A549; red, GM12878; cyan, H1-hESC; green, HepG-2; and blue, K562. 	Models were trained using different sets of chromatin features. We examined the predictive ability of chromatin features for SP1-TF co-occupancy in four cell types (ChIP-Seq data of SP1 were not available in the A549 cell), and the co-localizations of another six TFs, including ATF3, GABP, NRSF, POL2, USF1 and YY1. 
PMC4797273	GM12878	High prediction accuracies were generally obtained. 	For instance, all chromatin features as a whole were able to accurately predict the GABP-USF1 co-occupancy with AUC values >0.86 in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (Supplementary Figure S12A). 	For the prediction of SP1-TF combinational binding events, the average accuracies were ∼0.80, 0.77, 0.80 and 0.80 in the GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cells, respectively (Supplementary Figures S13A, B and Supplementary Table S5). For the 15 TF–TF co-occupancy with ATF3, GABP, NRSF, POL2, USF1 and YY1, chromatin features enable highly accurate predictions with AUC values >0.8 in all of five cell types (Supplementary Figures S14A, B and Supplementary Table S8). 
PMC4797273	GM12878	For instance, all chromatin features as a whole were able to accurately predict the GABP-USF1 co-occupancy with AUC values >0.86 in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (Supplementary Figure S12A). 	For the prediction of SP1-TF combinational binding events, the average accuracies were ∼0.80, 0.77, 0.80 and 0.80 in the GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cells, respectively (Supplementary Figures S13A, B and Supplementary Table S5).

The prediction abilities with a subset of or individual chromatin features for above TF–TF co-occupancy were similar to those for CTCF-TF co-occupancy. 
PMC4797273	GM12878	The results indicated that the cross-cell line applications of classifiers do not reduce their performances in predictions. 	For example, when we applied the models trained in the GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cell lines to the A549 cell for CTCF–YY1 predictions, the average prediction accuracies were 0.86, 0.77, 0.88 and 0.89, respectively, compared to 0.91 using the model trained by the A549 cell itself (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S15). 	The largest changes were observed with accuracies as 0.78, 0.76, 0.78 and 0.81 when models were trained within other four cells and applied to the H1-hESC cell, compared to 0.84 using model trained by the H1-hESC cell line, and vice versa, with accuracies as 0.77, 0.76, 0.81 and 0.79 when model was trained in the H1-hESC cell line and applied to the A549, GM12878, HepG-2 and K562 cells, compared to 0.91, 0.91, 0.91 and 0.90 when models were trained and applied to the same cell line (Supplementary Figure S15). We did the same analyses to other CTCF-TF, SP1-TF and ATF3-/GABP-/NRSF-/USF1-TF co-occupancy.

We did the same analyses to other CTCF-TF, SP1-TF and ATF3-/GABP-/NRSF-/USF1-TF co-occupancy. Due to the fact that not all TF binding profiles have been generated by the ENCODE project, we included various numbers of TFs in each type of cells (Supplementary Table S1).

(B) Boxplots of prediction differences indicated by |ΔAUC|, in the A549 and GM12878 cell lines. |ΔAUC| was calculated by subtracting cross cell predictions using models from other cell lines, indicated by colors, from predictions using models trained from the same cell line. 	Different features were used in each test (see complete figures in Supplementary Figure S20). The above analyses were also conducted in other two sets of TF–TF pairs, and similar trends were observed (Supplementary Figures S21 and S22). 
PMC4797273	GM12878	For instance, the cobindR software (69) uses PWMs to identify the co-occurring TFs and their binding sites. 	This sequence-based approach can detect 6,444 CTCF–YY1 co-occupying sites (PWMs obtained from http://jaspar.genereg.net (70)), which cover 49, 20, 31, 19 and 26% sites obtained from the ChIP-Seq data (Supplementary Table S1) in the A549, GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cells, respectively. 	As a comparison, our method used cell type-specific chromatin features as predictors, which largely improve predictive accuracy for cell type-specific TF–TF co-occupying sites (Supplementary Table S3). Of noting, the most importance is that our study illustrated the correlation between chromatin features and TF–TF co-occupancy, which is the main aim of this study and can improve our understanding of the interactions between epigenetic and genomic regulation. 
PMC4797273	GM12878	Most of TFBSs do not have methylated CpG site(s). 	In the GM12878 cell lines, 5583 out of 40 247 CTCF binding sites have ≥1 CpGs, including 2,415 CTCF–YY1 and 3148 CTCF-only sites. 	We constructed SVM classifier with DNA methylation and/or other chromatin features. The results showed that DNA methylation has very fair predication ability, with accuracies ∼0.57 in the five human cell lines. 
PMC4820219	NCT02135354	Methods/design 	Patients with COPD, hospitalized for an AE, who have a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years and had ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year will be enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT02135354). 	On top of a standardized treatment of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics, subjects will be randomized to receive either azithromycin or placebo during 3 months, at an uploading dose of 500 mg once a day for 3 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg once every 2 days. The primary endpoint is the time-to-treatment failure during the treatment phase (ie, from the moment of randomization until the end of intervention). 
PMC4820219	NCT02135354	Content 	This paper describes the BACE (the Belgian trial with azithromycin for acute COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization; clinicaltrial.gov number: NCT02135354) study design and its novel contributions to the current clinical research in the management of AEs of COPD. 	These include a study protocol designed to be embedded in a real-life hospitalization setting following an AE, assessing the efficacy and safety of a dose- and time-limited treatment with azithromycin for prevention in the highest risk period, not only during but also immediately after the acute event. Furthermore, as a primary endpoint, we evaluate the time-to-treatment failure, a novel combined clinical endpoint defined as either death, the admission to intensive care or requirement of additional systemic steroids or new antibiotics for respiratory reasons, or the diagnosis of a new AE after discharge.

PMC4930207	1EJ3	Green dashed lines with an arrowhead represent an H-bond going from donor to recipient. 	The structure is based on aequorin’s crystal structure [43](PDB ID: 1EJ3). 	Reprinted from [47] under a CC BY license, with permission from Open Access Dissertations, original copyright 2015. While all novel non-natural amino acid-modified aequorin variants show an increase in the half-lives of the bioluminescence emission, the most notable half-life changes are associated with the variants containing coelenterazine i. These variants display the longest bioluminescence decay half-lives with an average of approximately 1 minute, while the half-life of aequorin with native coelenterazine is approximately a half second (Table 1).

PMC4978508	2E9B	In case of the glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger forms with and without its native CBM20 were compared. 	Secondly, three enzymes known to have SBS(s),barley α-amylase AMY1 (GH13-1) [17,30,31], pig pancreatic α-amylase (GH13-6) [32,33] and pullulanase from Bacillus subtilis (GH13-5; PDB ID: 2E9B, unpublished), were selected as positive controls in the screening process. 	Additionally, three thoroughly structurally characterized enzymes in complex with carbohydrate ligands without a detected SBS served as pseudo-negative controls, although we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that they possess an SBS. These were barley β-amylase (GH14-1) [34,35], Cellvibrio japonicus β-mannanase (GH26-1) [36–39] and Clostridium cellulolyticus processive endoglucanase (GH48-1) [40–42]. 
PMC4978508	2E9B	Cellopentaose is tested with the cellulases and compared to the distinctly different maltotetraose and xylotetraose to probe not only the affinity, but also the specificity of recognition, given the promiscuous interactions seen via the other assays. 	GH13-5 (PDB ID: 2E9B, unpublished) and GH13-6 [32,33] possess SBSs as seen in crystal structures. 	All three GH13 enzymes give stoichiometries approaching 2 for β-cyclodextrin (Table 4), indicating the presence of at least one and possibly more SBSs, since in some GH13 enzymes β-cyclodextrin is not bound at the active site [10]. The measured fractional stoichiometry can arise because the enzymes are immobilized on the chip in different orientations, not having all binding sites well exposed [9]. 
PMC4978508	2E9B	Positive Controls 	Among the tested enzymes, three from GH13: GH13-1 [17,30,31], GH13-5 (PDB ID: 2E9B, unpublished) and GH13-6 [32,33] presented one or more SBSs in crystal structures and serve as positive controls for the purposes of this study. 	The properties of the two SBSs in GH13-1, barley α-amylase 1 (AMY1), have been extensively studied by using IPP [9,10], AE [9] and SPR assays [9,10]. However, exploitation of these techniques to detect SBSs in the absence of structural data has not been reported. 
PMC4978508	2E8Z	In the previous studies of GH13-5 and GH13-6, the SBSs were not analyzed in depth, but SBSs studied by mutational analysis in human salivary α-amylase having a high degree of identity with porcine pancreatic α-amylase (GH13-6) [45–48], were found to be important for binding to and activity against starch [48]. 	SPR analysis indicates GH13-5 and 13-6 have multiple binding sites for β-cyclodextrin (Table 4), possibly representing the active site where both crystal structures show bound α-cyclodextrin [49], PDB ID: 2E8Z (unpublished), and one, perhaps more, SBSs. 	Noticeably, the affinity at these multiple sites are not distinguished from one another, suggesting that they have similar Kd values. This has been seen for other SBS containing enzymes, e.g. Bacillus subtilis [7] and B. circulans xylanases [50] and barley AMY1 (GH13-1) [9]. 
PMC4978508	3NQQ	Furthermore, SPR does not give evidence of multiple binding sites, in agreement with GH6-1 crystal structures of oligosaccharide complexes that showed binding only in the active site [56]. 	GH5-1 [57], GH8-1 [58], GH10-1 [59,60], GH11-1 [50,61], GH13-3 [62,63] and GH31-1 (PDB ID: 3NQQ, unpublished) all have a counterpart of the enzyme within the same family (or subfamily in the case of GH13-3) that has an SBS demonstrated by X-ray crystallography (see Fig 3). 	For GH5-1 and GH10-1 binding is observed to only a single ligand (Table 1) expected to be capable of binding at the active site. However, in both enzymes the residues comprising the SBS in the related family member are conserved.

PMC5014156	PF03634	Sequence retrieval for TCP proteins 	The conserved TCP DNA-binding domain based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) (PF03634) was obtained from the Pfam protein family database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk). 	To identify the TCP TF coding genes of P. equestris, the HHM profile of the TCP domain was used as a query for an HMMER search (http://hmmer.janelia.org/) of the P. equestris genome sequence (Cai et al., 2015) (E-value=0.00001). Furthermore, to verify the reliability of the results, all candidate TCP sequences were analysed to confirm the presence of the conserved TCP domain by using InterproScan (Quevillon et al., 2005). 
PMC5014156	PF03634	Identification and sequence analyses of TCP genes from P. equestris 	To identify TCP TF coding genes, the HMM profile of the TCP domain (PF03634) was blast searched in the P. equestris genome (Cai et al., 2015). 	Full-length sequences of 23 TCP family genes were identified from the genome. All candidate TCP genes were confirmed to encode the conserved TCP domain with the use of InterproScan (Quevillon et al., 2005). 
PMC5050015	3J2T	A sharpened and normalized 3D map from the global 3D refinement was rendered as an iso-surface to show the wheel-like geometry of the apoptosome, which has dimensions of 270 x 270 x ~75 Å. Many rod-like α-helices are visible in the map that dominate the central hub and seven arms, while a cylindrical CARD disk sits atop the platform and shows little structural detail (Figure 1A and inset). 	A previous model of an extended Apaf-1 (Yuan et al., 2013; PDB 3J2T) was docked into the map with some rebuilding (Materials and methods) and pertinent statistics are summarized in Figure 1—source data 1.10.7554/eLife.17755.003Figure 1.Overview of 3D density maps for the active apoptosome.(A) A top view of the global 3D density map is shown with the platform in blue and the blurred CARD disk in magenta. Inset: The CARD disk was low pass filtered to ~14 Å resolution and is shown from the side. 	(B) Top view of the composite 3D density map. The sensor domain (with β-propellers (β7, β8) and cytochrome c) and the CARD disk are from maps obtained with focused 3D classification at ~6 Å resolution. 
PMC5050015	4RHW	To complete our analysis, we used focused 3D classification to reveal the architecture of the acentric CARD disk at ~5.8 Å (Materials and methods). 	A model for the disk was constructed by rigid-body docking of individual Apaf-1 and pc-9 CARDs from a crystal structure (Hu et al., 2014; PDB 4RHW) into the improved 3D map with Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). 	A composite 3D map for the active apoptosome was constructed by zoning with appropriate domain models in global and local maps with Chimera, and these density maps were combined for display (Figure 1B–D). Gold standard FSC curves were computed from independent half volumes using the entire global map, and for local maps containing the sensor domain with cytochrome c and the unblurred CARD disk. 
PMC5050015	3J2T	However, a focused 3D classification (Materials and methods; Zhou et al., 2015) allowed us to obtain an improved density map with a resolution of ~6.1 Å for this region. 	Structures of human Apaf-1 β-propellers (Reubold et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2013; 3J2T) were docked into the density map, along with bovine cytochrome c and a close-up view reveals their interactions (Figure 4A,B).10.7554/eLife.17755.012Figure 4.The sensor domain and interactions of β-propellers with cytochrome c.(A, B) An overview of β-propellers, cytochrome c and HD2 arm is shown with and without the density map.

This suggests that the lower energy anti conformer is correct and supports a possible role for Ser325 as a modulator of nucleotide binding affinity.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17755.01510.7554/eLife.17755.016Figure 5—figure supplement 2.A comparison of nucleotide binding pockets.(A) An overlay is shown for the Apaf-1 monomer with bound ADP (PDB 3SFZ; in light blue), aligned to Apaf-1 with dATP in the active apoptosome.

An anti conformation is adopted by the adenine base in both structures. When ADP is bound Ser325 (the modulator) hydrogen bonds with the 2' OH on the ribose ring, whereas this residue interacts with the 3' OH when dATP is present. 
PMC5050015	3LQQ	Intriguingly, the role of Tyr359 (in the HD1-WHD loop) in recognizing the γ-phosphate of dATP (and its relative position) are subsumed by His438 (in the WHD), which interacts with the β-phosphate of ADP in the closed configuration of Apaf-1. 	(B) The A-subunit from the crystal structure of the octameric CED-4 apoptosome (PDB 3LQQ) is overlayed with the Apaf-1 subunit with bound dATP. 	For clarity only the ATP molecule for CED-4 is shown in the binding site. In CED-4, a Mg+2 ion is bound and one ligand (Lys191) is replaced by Ser186 in Apaf-1 to weaken and possibly eliminate the binding site for this ion in the human complex.

PMC5050015	4RHW	The CARD spiral results in a rather open interface between two adjacent pc-9 CARDs at positions 8p-2p, and a novel interface is formed between Apaf-1 CARDs at positions 7a-1a (Figure 8E,F). 	Mutations were made in Apaf-1 and pc-9 CARDs using the crystal structure of the heterotrimer as a guide (Hu et al., 2014; PDB 4RHW). 	The zig-zag packing of three consecutive CARDs in the disk at positions 1 to 3, 3 to 5 and 5 to 7, is due to the presence of alternating Type I and II interfaces, as described in the crystal. Hence, mutations that disrupt Type I and Type II interfaces are supported by our model of the disk. 
PMC5050015	4RHW	In our study, we find that the path of paired Apaf-1/pc-9 CARDs in the disk describes roughly one turn of a spiral. 	In addition, Type I and II interfaces in the crystal structure of the Apaf-1/pc-9/Apaf-1 CARD trimer (Hu et al., 2014; 4RHW) are present in the disk, but with some distortions to accommodate the spiral geometry. 	Strikingly, only three well ordered pc-9 molecules are recruited to the disk, while a fourth pc-9 is present at lower occupancy.10.7554/eLife.17755.024Figure 9.Models of the active apoptosome.In these models, procaspase-9 dimers (PDB 1JXQ) are flexibly-tethered to the CARD disk and may represent the activated enzyme. CARD-p20/p10 linkers are shown as dashed lines, and are drawn roughly to scale for their length.

CARD-p20/p10 linkers are shown as dashed lines, and are drawn roughly to scale for their length. The number of possible pc-9 dimers in the active apoptosome may vary as a function of the number of pc-9 molecules tethered to the disk, with an odd number of zymogens creating parked catalytic domains for a single pc-9. 
PMC5050015	EMD-1931	A cleaned-up set of 92,867 particles was obtained by manual inspection, 2D and 3D classification in RELION-1.3 (Scheres, 2012). 	A previously published map (EMD-1931) was low pass filtered to 60 Å and used as the starting model for 3D classification. 	Refinement with c7 symmetry gave a map at 4.7 Å resolution (gold-standard FSC0.143). Per particle corrections for beam-induced motion and B-factor weighting for radiation damage were carried out with statistical movie processing in RELION-1.3 (Scheres, 2014) with frames 2–18, a running average of 5 frames and a standard deviation of 1 pixel for translations. 
PMC5050015	EMD-1931	After 2D classification with e2refine2d.py, particles in the best classes were selected (82091) and further segregated by a supervised 3D classification using e2refinemulti.py with two references. 	The first 3D reference was EMD-1931 (apoptosome with bound pc9 catalytic domains processed with c1 symmetry; Yuan et al., 2011a), while the second reference was constructed by removing density for the parked pc9 catalytic domains from the first reference map using Chimera. 	Particles in the class with bound catalytic domains (39985, ~48.7%) were used for c1 refinement with EMD-1931 as a reference, which was low pass filtered to 30 Å. This produced a map with a gold standard FSC0.143 of 7.2 Å with α-helical rods resolved in the central hub (not shown). However, density for the bound pc-9 catalytic domains was not resolved at α-helical resolution presumably due to local flexibility.

PMC5050015	3J2T	Model building 	A previously published model containing the NBD, HD1, WHD, HD2 and β-propellers (PDB 3J2T; Yuan et al., 2010) was used for model building. 	The full Apaf-1 model was docked into the map as a rigid body in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004), followed by Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF; Trabuco et al., 2008). The flexibly fitted model accounted well for most of the density, except for a loop between residues 349 to 364 in HD1. 
PMC5050015	3J2T	The resulting model was manually rebuilt and adjusted in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) with intervening cycles of real space refinement in PHENIX to insure proper geometry (Adams et al., 2010). 	In the next stage, β-propellers were docked into the local map of the V-shaped domain using MDFF, while cytochrome c (PDB 3J2T), and individual CARDs from a crystal structure (Hu et al., 2014; PDB 4RHW) were docked with rigid body fitting in Chimera. 	We then calculated a model vs map FSC0.5 to obtain an estimate of the final resolution for each of the models. All molecular figures were made with Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004; Goddard et al., 2005) and Adobe Photoshop.

Encouraging antitumor activity has been observed in both mRCC patients and in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Wilms’ tumor (WT), a common pediatric solid renal tumor, is formed when renal precursor cells fail to differentiate properly. Pode-Shakked et al.

PMC5103413	NCT02452554	A follow-up study showed that targeting the human NCAM+ cell fraction with lorvotuzumab-mertansine resulted in the loss of WT CSCs and induced a reduction in tumor size in the majority of cases, both in vitro and in vivo, followed by complete tumor degradation (Figure 3) (Pode-Shakked et al., 2013; Shukrun et al., 2014). 	A phase 2 trial evaluating lorvotuzumab-mertansine is ongoing (NCT02452554). 	Therefore, it can be concluded that using ADCs to deplete the stemness properties of CSCs by targeting ligands on the CSC cell surface may improve the impact of conventional chemotherapy. This would consequently result in a clinically relevant benefit for patients. 
PMC5103413	NCT01625936	New studies showed that CRLX101, a nanoparticle-drug conjugate containing camptothecin conjugated to a biocompatible cyclodextrin/polyethylene glycol (PEG) copolymer, is currently being evaluated pre-clinically and clinically in multiple tumor types (Gaur et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2016). 	A phase I trial of CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab for mRCC therapy has recently been completed (NCT016259365). 	The preliminary data showed that CRLX101 combined with bevacizumab is a safe treatment in mRCC. This combination fulfilled the protocol’s predefined threshold for further examination with responses and prolonged PFS in a heavily pretreated population (Keefe et al., 2016). 
PMC5103413	NCT02187302	This combination fulfilled the protocol’s predefined threshold for further examination with responses and prolonged PFS in a heavily pretreated population (Keefe et al., 2016). 	A randomized phase II clinical trial in mRCC of this combination is ongoing (NCT02187302). 	Several studies have proposed to target RCC using nanocarriers, but, to date, these approaches have not been investigated in renal CSCs. Nanoparticles effectively inhibit multiple types of CSCs by targeting specific markers, including ALDH, CD44, and CD133, and/or specific signaling pathways and other key developmental signaling pathways implicated in the maintenance of the CSC pool of many tumors (Lu et al., 2016).

PMC5137435	P19544	INTRODUCTION 	Wilms tumor suppressor protein (WT1; UniProt: P19544) is a zinc-finger transcription factor central to embryonic development of the genitourinary system (reviewed in (1–3)). 	The gene for human WT1, located in band 13 on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13), comprises 10 exons. Exons 1–6 encode N-terminal domains responsible for protein dimerization and for transcriptional regulation (4,5); exons 7–10 encode four C-terminal zinc fingers (ZF), the last three of which are primarily responsible for DNA sequence-discrimination and target binding (Supplementary Figure S1a). 
PMC5137435	5caC	In a previous study of binding to modified-cytosine forms of the Egr1 sequence, WT1 displayed markedly different affinities according to the type of modification present, suggesting that this protein might be responsive to epigenetic signals during development (29). 	In particular, WT1 bound with highest affinity when the modified base in the 3′ triplet was 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC—the terminal oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine), due to electrostatic attraction between the side chain of Q369 and the negatively charged carboxylate group (29). 	This observation prompted us to include in the present study of the Q369 mutations not only target nucleotide sequence variants, but also cytosine modification variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
PMC5137435	P19544	Site-directed mutagenesis 	GST-tagged human WT1 residues 350–437 (UniProt: P19544.2) for the -KTS isoform (pXC1295) and residues 350–440 for the +KTS isoform (pXC1329) were mutated and generated WT1-KTS Q369H (pXC1305), WT1+KTS Q369H (pXC1361), WT1-KTS Q369K (pXC1387), WT1+KTS Q369K (pXC1388), WT1-KTS Q369R (pXC1302), WT1+KTS Q369R (pXC1360), WT1-KTS Q369P (pXC1303) by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

PMC5137435	5caC	No change in fluorescence intensity was observed with the addition of protein. 	The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in Figure 1 were 3′-TGXGGGTGMGA-5′ and FAM-5′-TACZCCCAMGC-3′ (where M = 5mC, X = G, A, T, 5mC or 5caC and Z is the corresponding base paired with X). 	The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in Figure 3 were 3′-TGXGGGTGXGA-5′ and FAM-5′-TAZGCCCAZGC-3′ (where X and Z = C, 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC or 5caC as defined in Figure 3). Curves were fit individually using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Curves were fit individually using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Binding constants (KD) were calculated as [mP] = [maximum mP] × [C]/(KD + [C]) + [baseline mP] and saturated [mP] was calculated as saturation = ([mP] − [baseline mP])/([maximum mP] [baseline mP]), where mP is millipolarization and [C] is protein concentration. 
PMC5137435	5caC	Crystallography 	We crystallized WT1 in the presence of DNA by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C using equal amounts of protein–DNA mixtures (1 mM) and well solution (20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 40 mM citric acid, 60 mM Bis–Tris propane, pH 6.4 for Q369R–5caC complex; 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M Bis–Tris HCl, pH 6.5 for Q369H–5caC complex). 	The well solutions were 20 mM Citric Acid, 80 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 8.8 for normal WT1 Q369-A:T complex; 12% (w/v) PEG 3350, 4% (v/v) Tacsimate, pH 8.0 for Q369H-A:T complex; 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M Na-malonate, pH 7.0 for Q369R-G:C complex. Protein–DNA mixtures in equimolar ratios were incubated for 30 min at 16°C before crystallization. 
PMC5137435	4R2E	X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the SER-CAT beamlines (22BM-D and 22ID-D) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, and processed using HKL2000 (36). 	Initial crystallographic phases were determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the WT1-5mC (PDB 4R2E) as search models. 	Phasing, molecular replacement, map production, and model refinement were performed using PHENIX (37,38). The two mutant structures were solved, built, and refined independently. 
PMC5137435	5caC	WT1 (−KTS) showed the strongest binding to adenine at position X (KD = 0.03 μM); approximately 5-fold weaker binding to guanine (0.14 μM); and ∼25-fold weaker binding to thymine (0.8 μM) (Figure 1b). 	Previous analysis of cytosine modifications in the 3′ GCG triplet, showed that the affinity of WT1 (−KTS) for this site is 5caC > 5mC∼C > 5hmC > 5fC (29). 	The most strongly bound form, 5caC (KD = 0.1 μM), is bound with ∼3-fold lower affinity than adenine. This finding is in agreement with independent reports that WT1 binds with highest affinity when the 3′ triplet is GAG than when it is GCG (26,31).

This finding is in agreement with independent reports that WT1 binds with highest affinity when the 3′ triplet is GAG than when it is GCG (26,31). By comparison, anti-WT1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies of embryonic mouse kidney tissue found that the base in the middle position of the 3′ triplet was 51% C, 36% A (ChIP-chip (28)), and 71% A, 18% C (ChIP-seq (40)). 
PMC5137435	5caC	This adaptability is the likely reason ZF2 can tolerate different bases at this position. 	5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) is bound especially well among the five forms of cytosine, we found, due to attraction between the side chain of Q369 and the exocyclic carboxyl group (29). 	The three Q369 mutants have highest affinity for guanine in the 3′ triplet In further binding-affinity experiments, all three Q369 mutants were found to bind most strongly to guanine (G). 
PMC5137435	5caC	Q369K and Q369R (−KTS) also exhibited high-affinity binding with Guanine (KD = 0.014 and 0.024 μM), but binding to adenine was somewhat reduced, resulting in the predominant specificity, GGG (Figure 1D and E). 	Affinity for 5caC was substantial in all three mutants, particularly for Q369R (KD = 0.06 μM), as well as for normal WT1 (0.10 μM). 	In all instances thymine was bound with lowest affinity (Figure 1B–E). Each mutant displayed unique behavior. 
PMC5137435	5caC	Q369H discriminates purines (G and A; high-affinity substrates) from pyrimidines (C and T; low-affinity substrates) (Figure 1c). 	Q369R exhibited progressively weaker binding for the five bases tested: G > 5caC > A > 5mC > T (Figure 1d). 	And Q369K discriminates G from all of the rest (Figure 1E). We also measured the effects of two other amino acid substitutions of Q369 (−KTS), namely glutamate (Glu; E) and proline (Pro; P) (Figure 1F and G; see also Supplementary text).

PMC5137435	4R2R	R372, Q369, and R366 of ZF2 interacted specifically with Gua7, Ade8, and Gua9, respectively (Figure 2A and B) with the side-chain amide of Q369 forming an H-bond with the ring N7 atom of Ade8 (Figure 2C). 	Comparing this Q369-Ade structure with that of Q369-5caC (pdb: 4R2R) revealed that (i) the N7 atom superimposes on the C5 atom of 5caC (Figure 2D); (ii) the Q369 side chain is displaced slightly to accommodate the large 5caC carboxylate group (Figure 2E) and (iii) as a consequence, the side chain of R366 also shifts slightly, while the position of R372 remains unchanged (Figure 2E). 	The side-chain conformation that Q369 adopts in our structure is somewhat unexpected because it results in only a single H-bond to adenine, with the Ade N7 atom (Figure 2C), instead of bidentate contacts involving one with the N7 atom and the other with the 6-amino group. In principal, this H-bond can form equally well with Gua N7, implying that WT1 should display the same affinity for G in the middle of the 3′-triplet as it displays for A. This is not the case, however, as A is preferred by a factor of 4 or 5 (Figure 1B).

PMC5137435	2PRT	This might indicate that Q369 can rearrange in solution and form the second H-bond, one that can only arise with Ade, and not with Gua. 	Q369 also adopts a different conformation when juxtaposed with cytosine (see PDB: 2PRT (27). 	The Q369R ZF domain was crystallized with the G:C-containing oligo. The three arginine residues, R372, R369 and R366 aligned along the DNA major groove and formed two H-bonds each with the N7 and O6 atoms the three adjacent guanines (Figure 2f, g). 
PMC5137435	5caC	(A–D) Oligos fully methylated at both CpG sites (M/M), unmethylated at both sites (C/C), or methylated in only the bottom strand at both sites (C/M). 	(E–H) Oligos modified in only the top strand at both sites with 5mC (M), C, 5hmC, 5fC or 5caC. 	5mC was present in the bottom strand at both sites in all cases. (I–L) Oligos modified in only the top strand at the 3′ triplet. 
PMC5137435	5caC	All other sites contained 5mC (M). 	In turn, we replaced the cytosines in the top (‘recognition’) strand of the oligo with all three oxidized forms of 5mC—5-hydroxymethylC (5hmC), 5-formylC (5fC) and 5-carboxylC (5caC)—while retaining 5mC in the bottom strand. 	For normal WT1, all three oxidized forms reduced binding greatly, by 25-fold or more (Figure 3E), confirming our previous observation that WT1 distinguishes un-oxidized cytosine from oxidized cytosine rather than un-methylated cytosine from methylated cytosine (29). For the mutants, the effects of the oxidized forms differed. 
PMC5137435	5caC	For Q369R and Q369H, 5fC had little or no effect; for Q369K it reduced binding moderately. 	5caC reduced binding substantially for Q369H and Q369K, but less so for Q369R. 	And 5hmC proved uniformly detrimental (Figure 3f–h). Overall, cytosine oxidation was found to reduce binding affinity, with 5fC being least detrimental, 5hmC being most detrimental and 5caC being in between.

Overall, cytosine oxidation was found to reduce binding affinity, with 5fC being least detrimental, 5hmC being most detrimental and 5caC being in between. 	These results represented the combined effects of modifications at both CpG sites, and of their interactions with two amino acids, the one at position 369, and the glutamate at position 427. To focus more specifically on position 369, we examined the consequences of oxidized cytosine in the top strand of just the 3′ GCG triplet, keeping the other cytosines in the preferred, 5mC, state (Figure 3I).

The effects varied, as before, but normal WT1 and all three mutant binding domains now displayed very high affinity for 5caC—several-fold higher than for 5mC—and up to ten-fold increases in their affinities for 5hmC (Figure 3I–L).

R369 forms a de novo H-bond with the N7 atom of the adjacent Gua 9 (Figure 4D), and in doing so pushes the side chain of R366 partly out of the register (Figure 4E) so that it now H-bonds not only with the Gua 9 O6 atom, but also with the O4 atom of the adjacent base, Thy 10 (Figure 4F).

PMC5137435	5caC	R366 continues to be stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the side chain of D368, the position of which changes little (Figure 4D). 	Similar rearrangements are present in the structures of Q369H with 5caC (Figure 4G–L) and with 5fC (Figure 4P and Q). 	The R372–Gua7 interaction again remains unchanged. The imidazole ring of the H369 side-chain stacks on the 5caC carboxylate group (Figure 4H, I) and aligns with the purine ring of Gua 9, although it is perhaps too far removed to form H-bonds (Figure 4J).

In the structure with 5fC, a water molecule mediates the interaction between H369 and Gua9 N7 (Figure 4P). 
PMC5137435	5caC	Normal WT1, for example, binds the target sequence well when either cytosine or 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is present at both sites, but binds poorly when any of the three oxidized forms of cytosine are present instead. 	Q369H and Q369R, by comparison, are very much more tolerant of the presence of 5-formylcytosine (5fC) at both sites, and Q369R is also more tolerant of 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), probably due to the increased positive charge. 	Affinity changes such as these, we speculate, might allow DDS mutants of WT1 to bind, with unpredictable consequences, to an array of new genomic sites in addition to, or instead of, those normally bound. The common effect of such ‘off-target’ binding could be to reduce the amount of normal WT1 available to bind to correct sites, an effect that would be exacerbated if WT1 bound as a dimer rather than a monomer (5,54) due to sequestration of normal WT1 into dysfunctional heterodimeric complexes. 
PMC5137435	5caC	Accumulating evidence supports the view that 5hmC exists as a relatively stable modification, constituting a distinct epigenetic signal (60,61) that marks lowly expressed genes, gene bodies, and intragenic regions (reviewed in (62,63)). 	5fC and 5caC are found at much lower levels and at fewer sites, but are enriched at mono-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1)-marked enhancers (64–69), implying that these higher oxidized forms might play an important role in enhancer activity. 	Despite an enormous amount of work on the biochemistry, genetics, and physiology of WT1 spanning several decades, much remains unclear. From our perspective as specialists in protein-DNA structural interactions, the role of ZF1, for example, continues to puzzle us.

The target sequence of the FGFR3-specific oligonucleotide probes was located in exons 3 to 11 corresponding to nucleotide numbers 395–1595 in the sequence of NM_000142.3 of FGFR3 except for exons 8, 9 and 10, which are variable in alternative splicing. 	Thus the probes specifically hybridize to all three variants of human FGFR3 mRNA.

PMC5191969	NCT01265498	Human studies with FXR agonists are ongoing, and, at the present time, only two trials have been published, both with the BA‐derivative, OCA. 	Mudaliar et al. first showed that administration of OCA to patients with NAFLD and T2DM improved insulin resistance and decreased liver fibrosis markers.68 More recently, the FLINT (FXR Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01265498,) trial,69 which included NASH patients treated with OCA [6α‐ethyl‐CDCA], a potent FXR agonist (25 mg/day for 72 weeks), provided information on the metabolic effects of FXR agonism on glucose and lipid metabolism in humans. 	In this study, patients treated with OCA showed increased serum levels of insulin and a higher homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, a finding that disagrees with previous studies where short‐term administration of OCA improved insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients.68 It should be noted that the HOMA index is an imperfect method to assess insulin resistance in diabetic patients,70 which ideally should be assessed using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. At this time, it is unclear whether the apparently contradictory findings are related to the methods used to assess insulin resistance or whether there are adaptive changes in glycemic control with long‐term use of OCA. 
PMC5191969	NCT01999101	In addition to OCA, other FXR agonists are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. 	For example, the synthetic FXR agonist Px‐102/Px‐10479 (and the follow‐up compound GS‐9674) is being tested in a phase IIa randomized, clinical trial in patients with NAFLD (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01999101), and the selective and highly potent WAY‐362450/FXR‐450 compound is in early‐phase clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00499629). 	Indeed, this is a very active area, and other agents that will likely emerge as novel FXR modulators continue to be developed.80 A recent mouse study using an intestinal‐restricted FXR agonist, fexaramine, also raises questions regarding the optimal target tissue for FXR agonism to treat metabolic disease.81 Finally, recent findings from Correia et al.82 describing relevant differences among the hepatic FXR isoforms (α1 and α2) with regard to the mechanisms by which they limit hepatocellular lipid accumulation (i.e., with each variant regulating a distinct gene set and Fxrα2 more robustly decreasing hepatic triglyceride levels) could be important to further improve the therapeutic efficacy of FXR agonists. Although somehow contradictory with the aforementioned data, FXR antagonism could also be of benefit in NAFLD.

PMC5191969	NCT02279524	Aramchol is a novel synthetic lipid molecule obtained by conjugating two natural components, CA and arachidic acid (a saturated FA), through a stable amide bond. 	This FA/BA conjugate inhibits SCD1 activity and activates cholesterol efflux by stimulating the ABC transporter, A1, a pan cellular cholesterol export pump.98 In a phase 2 study involving 60 patients with biopsy‐proven NAFLD, treatment with 100 or 300 mg/day of aramchol for 3 months significantly reduced liver fat content in a dose‐dependent manner and was associated with a trend of metabolic improvements.99 A large‐scale, multicenter, phase IIb, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol in NASH is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02279524). 	Modulation of Gut Microbiota As mentioned above, the GM is responsible for a myriad of chemical modifications of BAs that can modify both BA pool size and BA signaling properties.56 Thus, therapeutic interventions targeting GM in NAFLD/NASH may, at least partially, act through induction of changes in host BA profiles.

PMC5384747	2A9S	This, together with the data obtained by gel filtration (about 41 kDa) (S3 Fig), confirmed the dimeric nature of AtCinA in solution. 	This dimeric form also agrees with the deposited crystal structure (PDB code: 2A9S). 	The purified enzyme was able to fully transform NMN into NaMN, with no apparent inhibition or side products being observed after 1 hour in the tested conditions (10 mM NMN) (S4 Fig), an observation of biotechnological relevance for obtaining pure NaMN. In addition, no activity was detected when the enzyme was incubated with NAD+, NADH or nicotinamide, even at high enzyme concentrations, as has previously been described for Shewanella oneidensis PncC [18]. 
PMC5384747	4UOC	Of note was the absence of activity in Y58A compared with Y58F, despite both having the same Tm. 	This could be related to the presence of an aromatic ring in Y58F (but not in Y58A), which could interact with the nicotinamide ring, helping the substrate to bind to the active center, even in the absence of the important hydrogen bond displayed between Y58 and NaMN phosphate group in the crystal structure of TtPncC (pdb code 4UOC) (Fig 7) [22].

PMC5384747	2A9S	However, no NMN deamidase from this group or from alpha-proteobacteria has been characterized to date. 	Curiously, the only information available for this subgroup is the AtCinA structure (2A9S), deposited by Midwest Center for Structural Genomics in the Protein Data Bank, but not published. 	AtCinA shows a broad range of activity from neutral to basic pH The biochemical studies carried out after the cloning and purification of AtCinA showed it to be the second CinA, after A. vinelandii CinA [20], to have a neutral optimum pH (pH 7.5) (Fig 4A). 
PMC5384747	4UOC	These data are the first values of a melting temperature reported for a NMN deamidase. 	In order to explain this high melting temperature, the AtCinA structure was compared with that of the CinA domain of the bifunctional NMN deamidase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 4UOC). 	The AtCinA dimer showed a similar number of hydrogen bonds per residue than the CinA domain of TtPncC (3.76 vs 3.66), and a surprisingly high number of ion pairs (26 vs 19). In fact, the number of ion pairs per residue in AtCinA was 0.056, which is higher than the average value (0.04) found in proteins [36]. 
PMC5384747	4UOC	This effect, never before described, is not related with a general change in structure, since both mutants have similar Tm values (83°C) (Table 1). 	Rather, it might be due to aromatic π-stacking between the nicotinamide moiety of NMN/NaMN and tyrosine/phenylalanine aromatic ring, as predicted by the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler web site [29], not only for the NaMN structurally aligned to the crystal structure of AtCinA (Fig 7A), but also for that crystallized in TtPncC (PDB code 4UOC) [22] (Fig 7B), with an average distance of 3.3 Å between the centroids of the aromatic rings in both structures, as calculated by Chimera (Fig 7) [32]. 	This mutational analysis also pointed to the total loss of activity in R145A but, in this case, the changes induced in the structure seemed to be responsible for the loss in activity, as confirmed by the 31°C decrease in Tm compared with that of wild type enzyme (Table 1). This result agrees with that previously described by Raffaelli´s group for the equivalent R142A mutant in E. coli using circular dichroism [23].

PMC5668560	NC_010446.4	We also referred to the AQP10 orthologs from annotation pipeline available at “ortholog_gene_89872” in NCBI from 103 organisms. 	It should be noted that Sus scrofa (pig), the ancestor of cattle, has a perfect AQP10 gene without deletions or insertions (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_010446.4). 	The genomic AQP10 gene of ruminantia In the genome of B. Taurus, we identified the AQP10 ortholog (NCBI Reference Sequence: AC_000160.1). 
PMC5668560	AC_000160.1	The genomic AQP10 gene of ruminantia 	In the genome of B. Taurus, we identified the AQP10 ortholog (NCBI Reference Sequence: AC_000160.1). 	The exon nucleotide sequences of the bovine AQP10 gene were highly homologous to those of the human AQP10 gene. However, the open reading frame for the bovine AQP10 gene had two deletions leading to frame-shifts at exon 1 and exon 5 (exon 1; C and exon 5; CTT, GA)(Fig. 1, Fig. 2). 
PMC5668560	EW289993.2	Furthermore, the blast search for AQP10 cDNA clones in bovine ESTs libraries at NCBI failed to detect any clones. 	On the other hand, a porcine AQP10 EST clone, GenBank: EW289993.2 from small intestine and jejunum from KVL (Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University) was identified by the blast search. 	Another porcine AQP10 EST clone, GenBank: DY418303.1 from the library made with RNA pooled from multiple tissues including brain, liver, muscle, placenta/endometrium, ovary, testes, and bone marrow was also found. Therefore, bovine AQP10 gene may not be transcribed or degraded for its unstable mRNA.

PMC5815766	rs4686434	We used Mendelian randomization analysis by incorporating information of genetic variants in FETUB and serum fetuin-B concentrations with insulin resistance in 1148 obese Chinese adults.

PMC5815766	rs4686434	Based on the baseline examination of our designed cohort study of 1523 community-living healthy obese Chinese adults (unpublished data), we previously found that serum fetuin-B level was positively correlated with intrahepatic triglyceride content, and elevated serum fetuin-B was independently associated with increased risk of insulin resistance in obese Chinese. 	Furthermore, we have also shown that the minor allele G for FETUB rs4686434 was significantly associated with decreased intrahepatic triglyceride content and might confer lower susceptibility of NAFLD in Chinese adults. 	In the present study, by incorporating all information of common genetic variants in the FETUB locus and serum fetuin-B concentrations with insulin resistance, we aimed to explore the potential causal relationship between fetuin-B and insulin resistance in obese Chinese adults by suing MR analysis.

To perform the MR analysis of fetuin-B and HOMA-IR, we first explored which of the 4 selected tagging SNPs within the FETUB locus were significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentration, then 3 tagging FETUB SNPs (rs3733159, rs4686434, and rs6785067) which were found to be significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentration were chosen as instrumental variables. 	Second, to test if assumptions required for MR analysis were met in our study, we explored if these 3 tagging SNPs were associated with any of the potential confounders listed in Table 1, and found no statistically significant association. Then we used the ordinary least square regression analysis for the association between measured serum fetuin-B concentration and HOMA-IR, and we found that per SD greater measured serum fetuin-B concentration was significantly associated with greater HOMA-IR.

PMC5928086	GCA_000149405.2	Alignment of sequence reads against the reference genome 	A prerequisite of variant calling from genomic shotgun sequencing data is the alignment of sequence reads against a reference sequence45, in this case the genome sequence of T. pseudonana (GenBank: GCA_000149405.2). 	Prior to alignment, reads were trimmed and filtered to remove low-confidence base-calls by applying TrimGalore with command line options “-q 30” and “--paired”. Alignment was performed using BWA-mem version 0.7.12-r103953,54.

In particular, VT-1161 is currently under phase I clinical trial for onychomycosis NCT02267356 (Garvey et al., 2015; Schell et al., 2017a). 	This drug inhibits the fungal cytochrome P-450 enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase (Cyp51), being effective against several fungi including the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum (Garvey et al., 2015).

PMC6102569	5CSX	The big differences in BSVs among different PBD structures could explain the observed difficulties in B-RAF cross-docking experiments. 	B-RAF inhibitor b3 has many rotatable bonds and was bound to one of the biggest binding sites (PDB: 5CSX, BSV = 438 Å3). 	It had no solutions when it was cross-docked in the other binding sites with lower or similar BSVs. Compounds f3 and g3 have less rotatable bonds and were bound to smaller size binding sites. 
PMC6102569	3D4Q	Compounds f3 and g3 have less rotatable bonds and were bound to smaller size binding sites. 	In general, they also fail in most of the cross-docking experiments, but they have solutions mainly when cross-docking was done inside other PDB structures in the same BSV range, such as 4YHT, 3D4Q, 2FB8, and 3PRF. 	This analysis suggests that the number of rotatable bonds and the different BSVs are the key effects that lead to problems in B-RAF cross-docking experiments. At the same time, different orientations of the residue side chains in the binding site (as we observed previously in Figure S3 of the Supplementary Material) cause the differences in B-RAF BSVs.

PMC6107845	KM519600	For all infection experiments, cryo-conserved bacterial stocks were used and prepared as described previously (Willenborg et al., 2014). 	The open reading frame of MuV-HN (GenBank accession no.: KM519600) was cloned into the expression vector pCG1 and connected with a sequence coding for a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the C-terminal end (Krüger et al., 2015). 	Neuraminidase treatment For desialylation, bacteria cultures or virus-bacteria mixtures were incubated with 200 mU or 500 mU neuraminidase (NA) type V from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma Aldrich, Munich) for 1 h at 37°C, then the enzyme was removed and bacteria were washed three times with cold PBS before subjected to co-sedimentation assays or co-infection of HEp-2 cells, respectively. 
PMC6126444	NCT01558427	Median survival was significantly longer in patients with treated oligometastatic disease than in those with treated polymetastatic disease (>3 vs. 11 mo, P = 0.02). 	More recently, Ost et al. reported on the results of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II trial comparing surveillance with MDT for oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence (STOMP trial, NCT01558427) (20). 	Sixty-two asymptomatic noncastrate men with prior definitive treatment for primary prostate cancer who presented with biochemical recurrence with 3 or fewer extracranial metastases on choline PET were randomized (balanced on the basis of prostate-specific antigen doubling time and nodal vs. nonnodal metastases) to either surveillance or MDT (surgery or SBRT) of oligometastases. The primary endpoint was androgen-deprivation therapy–free survival with a median follow-up time of 3 y. The androgen-deprivation therapy–free survival was significantly longer with MDT than with surveillance alone (21 vs. 12 mo; hazard ratio, 0.55; log-rank P = 0.08, per-protocol analysis). 
PMC6126444	NCT02680587	Interestingly, 35% of patients undergoing surveillance experienced relatively short-duration spontaneous prostate-specific antigen declines without any therapy, whereas 30% of patients treated with MDT progressed to polymetastatic disease within the first year. 	A similar phase II trial (ORIOLE) is also under way, which randomizes men with noncastrate oligometastatic prostate cancer (identified on prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand imaging with 18F-DCFPyl PET/CT) to either surveillance or selective ablative radiotherapy of metastatic lesions, with the primary clinical endpoint of progression at 6 mo from randomization (NCT02680587) (21). 	Safety, efficacy, and effects of selective ablative radiotherapy–directed therapy of oligometastases on circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and immunologic response will also be measured. Nevertheless, it still remains to determine whether the strategy of MDT-directed therapy of oligometastases (with or without additional systemic therapy to combat invisible micrometastases) leads to improved disease-specific or overall survival (22).

To further validate that the domain-swapped dimeric structures are not the artifact by the crystal packing, we generated a structure-based Q125C mutation on the helix α2b to facilitate the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between the two subunits of the domain-swapped dimer (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that DEDF122A/Q125C migrates as both dimer and monomer in the absence of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (βME), while runs as the monomer in the presence of βME, suggesting the disulfide bond formation between the two subunits in the absence of reducing agent.

PMC6239125	rs10033900	CFI is a serum protease that inhibits all complement pathways. 	The common variant rs10033900 near the CFI gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk in Han Chinese population. 	Based on the gene expression profile, we found that upregulated CFI indicates good prognosis, while Okroj et al suggested that high expression of CFI is associated with poor prognosis and recurrence in breast cancer.33 In our study, we systematically characterized DEGs from the exosomes derived from BMSCs and identified certain hub proteins and their PPI networks.

PMC6256699	AB456955	Among these isolated bacteria, Pseudonocardia autotrophica NBRC 12743 showed the highest VD3-hydroxylating activity, and the strain has thus been applied to one-pot commercial production of calcitriol (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) (1, 5). 	The gene encoding VD3 hydroxylase (Vdh) was successfully cloned and sequenced (GenBank accession number AB456955) (2), showing that Vdh is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. 	Directed-evolution studies together with three-dimensional structure analyses of Vdh have also been performed to improve its enzymatic activity (2, 6–8). A draft genome sequence of this strain with 117 contigs was reported recently (9).

PMC6262394	NCT01711125	Future research examining the interaction between commencing ADs during baclofen treatment on alcohol dependent patients is required. 	Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01711125, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01711125 	Introduction World-wide, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 5.9% of all deaths and is a causal factor in a larger number of disease and injury conditions (1). 
PMC6262394	NCT01711125	No individuals commenced AD while on the trial. 	The study was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of the Sydney Local Health District, Northern Sydney Local Health District and South Western Sydney Local Health District (X11-0154 & X07-0041 & X01-0262) and the main trial was registered in the Clinical Trials Registry (NCT01711125). 	The study involved off-label use of a registered medication in Australia and approval was given under the Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) scheme of the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) (2013/0060). Flow of participants through the randomized controlled 12-week trial of placebo, baclofen 30, and baclofen 75 in the treatment of alcohol dependence, including receipt of concurrent antidepressants (AD) at least two months prior to trial commencement. 
PMC6267643	NCT01674803	Methods 	Participants in BIO-RESORT (NCT01674803), an investigator-initiated multicenter, randomized all-comers trial, were treated with very thin-strut BP-DES (Synergy or Orsiro) or thin-strut DP-DES (Resolute Integrity). 	For the present analysis, patients were classified following HBR criteria based on previous trials. The primary endpoint was target vessel failure: a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization at 1 year. 
PMC6267643	NCT01674803	The study design and population, as well as the main 1-year results have been published previously [12, 13]. 	In brief, BIO-RESORT (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01674803) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 3514 all-comers who were treated with PCI. 	The study was performed at four clinical sites in the Netherlands (Thoraxcentrum Twente, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede; Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem; Haga Hospital, The Hague; Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht). Patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older, capable of providing informed consent, and required a PCI with DES implantation according to clinical guidelines or the operators’ judgment. 
PMC6267643	NCT02623140	The very thin-strut sirolimus-eluting Orsiro BP-DES has recently shown favorable results versus everolimus-eluting DP-DES [29, 30]. 	In addition, in the SORT-OUT IX trial (NCT02623140), Orsiro is being compared to the BioFreedom stent, which was previously tested in LEADERS FREE. 	Upcoming results of some of the abovementioned trials may reveal the safety of using an abbreviated DAPT regimen in HBR patients treated with a DES, used in the present study. While the absence of durable polymers in BP-DES may reduce inflammation and promote arterial healing, meta-analyses thus far showed no unequivocal benefit in clinical outcome for broad patient populations treated with BP-DES over DP-DES [5–8].

PMC6299218	PF04326	Orange PAZ domains have the full-sized pocket responsible for 3′-end guide binding, while light-brown PAZ* variants do not have the second subdomain. 	The OB-fold is the nucleic acid-binding domain SSF50249; the DNA-binding domains are Schlafen domain with AlbA_2 (PF04326) or lambda-repressor-like domain (SSF47413). 	As justified by their name, we found that all members of the short pAgo clade lack the PAZ domain implicated in binding of the 3′ end of a guide molecule. The majority of short pAgos (470, or 81%) have only two domains, MID and PIWI. 
PMC6299218	PF04326	One of these truncated proteins also lacks the MID domain. 	On the other hand, 15 long pAgos that have the PAZ domain also carry additional putative nucleic acid binding domains at their N termini: 7 pAgos contain DNA-binding domains (Schlafen, PF04326, or lambda-repressor-like, SSF47413) and 8 pAgos contain a nucleic acid binding domain with the OB-fold (SSF50249) (Fig. 1B and 2B). 	Analysis of the diversity of MID, PIWI, and PAZ domains revealed significant variations in their structures characteristic for different groups of pAgos (Fig. 1B and 2), as described below. In particular, subsets of proteins from both clades of long pAgos contain MID* domains with substitutions of key residues involved in interactions with the guide 5′ end; many long-A pAgos and all long-B and short pAgos contain PIWI* variants with substitutions of essential catalytic residues; and most long-B pAgos contain incomplete variants of the PAZ* domain involved in the 3′-guide interactions (Fig. 2).

PMC6299218	PF04326	The DNA-binding domains in pAgo-associated proteins include the lambda repressor-like DNA-binding domain (og_2), helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains (og_18, og_49, og_73, and og_79), the Schlafen domain with an AlbA_2 subdomain (og_37), and DNA-binding components of the type I restriction-modification system (HsdS) (og_11). 	Interestingly, the lambda repressor-like DNA-binding domain (PF01381) from highly represented orthogroup og_2 and the Schlafen DNA-binding domain AlbA_2 (PF04326) from og_37 were found to be fused with several long-B pAgos (Fig. 2B). 	Overall, analysis of proteins in pAgo operons strongly indicates the involvement of nuclease, helicase, and DNA-binding activities in cellular pathways dependent on pAgos (see Discussion). Beyond nucleases and DNA-binding proteins, 10% of all long pAgo operons encode hydrolases and phosphatases (og_47, og_62, and og_55).

PMC6367104	PF16166	The gene is rapidly evolving, as evident from the fact that simple BlastP searches are not sensitive enough to reveal homology of the respective sequences from distantly related eustigmatophytes, and no candidate homologs outside eustigmatophytes could previously be identified even when using more sensitive methods. 	However, the substantially expanded sampling of orf403/457 sequences improved the sensitivity of an HHpred search, which suggested homology of the C-terminal half of the Orf403/457 protein to the Pfam TIC20 family (PF16166) with the probability value >90. 	The TIC20 family includes not only the key component of the TIC translocon at the inner plastidial membrane but also the Ycf60 protein encoded by pt genomes of several algal groups including rhodophytes, haptophytes, and, notably, some ochrophytes, namely phaeophytes and xanthophytes (Le Corguillé et al. 2009), but arguably not eustigmatophytes (Yurchenko et al. 2016). To better understand the distribution of the ycf60 gene in ochrophytes, we employed the known Ycf60 sequence from the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus as a query for a PSI-Blast search, which led to the identification of previously unrecognized ycf60 genes in pt genomes of pelagophytes and the bolidophyte Triparma laevis.

PMC6368046	KY653751	We found two lineages of Plasmodium (identified as 1 and 2 in Fig. 2) in three individuals of Hoatzin. 	The individuals caught in 2010 (one adult and one juvenile) were infected with the same Plasmodium lineage (KY653750–KY653751), and their mtDNA genome sequences were 100% identical. 	A Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis of Plasmodium parasites infecting the Hoatzins (O. hoazin) caught at the Cojedes River, Venezuela. We constructed phylogenetic trees based on parasites (A) partial sequences of the cytb gene (45 sequences and 480 bp excluding gaps) and mtDNA genomes (31 sequences and 5286 bp excluding gaps). 
PMC6368046	KY653749	The identity of this lineage could be established when more samples from birds with high parasitemia of this haemosporidian parasite become available. 	Regarding the second lineage found infecting hoatzin (KY653749, Fig. 2), it appears as the common ancestor of a clade that includes Plasmodium tejerai, Plasmodium matutinum and Plasmodium lutzi. 	This clade forms a monophyletic group with P. elongatum (Fig. 2); one of the most pathogenic and generalist avian malaria parasite worldwide (Palinauskas et al., 2016). Given that we did not find any sequence with 100% similarity with our lineage in the available databases, this result indicates that likely a new parasite is circulating in the area.
